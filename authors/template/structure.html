>   As this type of document is supposed to be as much for learning as
   a technical reference document I have rearranged the structure to
   this end. For the designer of a system it is more useful to have
   the information presented in terms of the goals of this exercise
   than from the point of view of the logical layer structure of the
   devices themselves. Nevertheless this document would not be
   complete without such a layer structure the computer field is so
   full of, so I will include it here as an introduction to how it
   works.

    with the application on top and the physical layer on the bottom.
    It is quite useful to show the interrelationship between each of
    the layers used in controlling drives.

>    Most users start out with a given set of hardware and some plans
    on what they wish to achieve and how big the system should be.
    This is the point of view I will adopt in this document in
    presenting the material, starting out with hardware, continuing
    with design constraints before detailing the design strategy that
    I have found to work well. I have used this both for my own
    personal computer at home, a multi purpose server at work and
    found it worked quite well. In addition my Japanese co-worker in
    this project have applied the same strategy on a server in an
    academic setting with similar success.

>    Finally at the end I have detailed some configuration tables for
    use in your own design. If you have any comments regarding this
    or notes from your own design work I would like to hear from you
    so this document can be upgraded.
