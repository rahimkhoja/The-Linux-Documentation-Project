<title>HOWTO-template for small HOWTOs     <!-- insert your title here -->
<author>Stein Gjoen, <tt/sgjoen@nyx.net/ <!-- insert your name here -->
<date>v0.03, 20 May 2002            <!-- always have a version number and a date -->
<abstract>                          <!-- the abstract: a short and precise description -->
<nidx>(your index root)</nidx>    <!-- add indexing keywords as you go along -->
                         <!-- nidx means the indexed word is not in output of main text, only in the index -->
This is a fully working template for small HOWTOs. The source contains
fully described slots to make a convenient framework for you to fill in
for making your own HOWTO, suggesting some names, conventions and contents
for the chapters.

While derived from the Template for big HOWTOs this
is a minimalistic Template that only lists the
minimal requirements to fit into the
Linux Documentation Project archives

<sect>Introduction

<p> <!-- always use a p tag (paragraph) immediately after a sect tag -->
<nidx>(your index root)!introduction</nidx>   <!-- here introduction is a sub entry of template, exclamationmark is separator -->
<em>My comments to the reader is in this style (emphasized)</em>.
Example lines are in plain roman style.
<em>Note that extra comments and advice is found in comments
within the SGML source.</em> <!-- such as this comment -->

For various reasons this brand new release is codenamed
the <bf/unleash/ release.

New code names will appear as per industry standard guidelines
to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this document.

<p>
<em>This Template is a suggestion and a starting point, a check list
for minimum features and also examples for authors.
Over time HOWTOs will outgrow any template since
in the end the goal is to inform readers efficiently.</em>

Stating the background is a simple way to getting started
writing the intro.

<em>This is where you make a summary of what it news. When a HOWTO exceeds
20 pages it takes more than a casual read to find the updates. This is
where you help your readers with that, alerting them to specific and
important news.</em>

This is the first update featuring an improved structure.
<!-- Note that you might wish to keep old news commented out for reference
and perhaps state news as latest and next to latest update. -->

<em>Tell people where the document home page is so the very newest
release could be found in case of problems with the main
<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
    name="Linux Documentation Project">
homepage.
</em>

The latest version number of this document can be gleaned from my

First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development shows it is
quite important.
