<center><H1>Guidelines for Authors</h1></center>
<ul>
  <li>
    We recommend to edit your articles with a plain text editor.
    A WYSIWYG HTML editor may also do the job but produces
    usually &quot;ugly&quot; HTML files with lot of &amp;nbsp; and &lt;BR&gt;
    in it.
  </li>
  <li>No matter how you edit your article your should always use our
      template (<a href="articles/template.meta.html">template.meta.html</a>).
      This is a simple HTML file with some structure in it. After the
      heading ArticleBody you can just write your article as you like.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the subject of the article favors it, we encourage the 
    inclusion of illustrations and figures in the body of the
    article. Authors are free to use diagrams to illustrate ideas,
    organize concepts or to motivate readers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every article in our magazine brings a picture of the author
    and a small personal biography. The biography can be a few paragraphs
    long and its goal its to give authors a chance to talk about
    their history, professional background, hobbies, relation to
    Linux, etc. This information should be included in the template 
    after the heading AboutTheAuthor. The picture of the author
    goes after AuthorImage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before writing a new article think a bit about the structure of 
    your article and the message that you would like to send to the
    reader. The best articles are understandable for new Linux users and
    and still interesting to people with experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    An article is a window to a given field of knowledge. Do not
    leave that door closed. Include references at the end of
    the article, both to Web publications (URLs) and to
    printed sources.
  </li>
  <li>
    Articles can be submitted to the editor of your own
    language or directly to the editor-in-chief (currently this is
    <a href="mailto:guido.socher@linuxfocus.org">guido.socher@linuxfocus.org</a>
    ). The <a href="../common/lfteam.html">lf-team</a> page has
    a list of contact persons with e-mail addresses.
    Preferably your article and the included images, code examples
    etc... should be packed together in a tar.gz archive.
    The command to do this under Linux is:<br>
    <tt>tar zcvf myart.tar.gz file1 file1 file3...</tt>
  </li>
</ul> 

    <p>Happy editing and thanks for you time and creativity! 
    We look forward to receive your article.</P>
