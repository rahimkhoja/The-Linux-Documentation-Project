          <h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial" color=
          "#660033">Editorial</font></h3>
          by Ismael Ripoll<br>
           

          <p>In the beginning, I joined the LinuxFocus project
          because I thought Spanish speakers needed a free
          GNU/Linux magazine. At that time all the articles
          received at LF were originally written in english, and
          most of the work was to translate them to Spanish. It was
          not easy to foresee the great welcome it was going to get
          from Spanish and Latin America people. Success was backed
          by the high number of collaborators (currently more than
          90), the great number of readers, and the technical press
          recognition.</p>

          <p>Before starting LinuxFocus, projects like LuCAS (Linux
          in CAStilian) or SLUG (Spanish Linux User Group) already
          made Linux documentation in Spanish. Their main goal was,
          and still is, to translate the documentation produced by
          the the LDP (Linux Documentation Project) to Spanish. Our
          goal is similar in the sense that we produce
          documentation about GNU/Linux in Spanish, but from a
          pedagogical point of view. We think that not only the
          technical contents of the articles are important but also
          the way the information is presented.</p>

          <p>LinuxFocus is more than a hobby and a source of
          pleasure to all the people that collaborate in the
          project, it is also a way to open up new professional
          areas. Authors, translators and reviewers are always
          training and showing their skills and knowledge. This
          kind of knowledge is what is required by most
          enterprises.</p>

          <p>LinuxFocus is a cross road of people with knowledge
          who want to share their knowledge with others, and
          readers who want something more than just an introduction
          to the wonderful world of Linux.</p>

          Back</font></h3>

          <p>After a long time away Esperanza Sepulveda joins the
          LF family once more. She will use her expertise not only
          to provide high quality illustrations to the magazine but
          also to reduce the download size of the images.</p>

          <p>She is a graphic designer, major in Arts by the
          Facultad de Bellas Artes de Madrid. She attends the same
          school as graduate student and takes part of a research
          project on digital media and art. Works for a corporation
          in the graphics design department and has experience with
          digital retouching and design. An interest on the
          internet as a communication media has brought her to
          collaborate with LinuxFocus.</p>

      Guzm&aacute;n, Ranko Zotovic<br>
       The field of mobil robotics has experienced an enormous
      growth the past few years. Many Departments of Robotics,
      Mechatronics, and Artificial Inteligence have focused part of
      their research to the study of autonomous vehicles. Until
      now, the high costs in R &amp; D have limited their use in
      aerospace, military and nuclear power industries. However the
      current fast pace of development in the field is allowing the
      introduction of this technology in commercial areas like
      agriculture, industry, services, mining, medicine, and
      others. It is a strategic sector with a great potential for
      growth.</li>
