<A NAME="361lfindex0">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>WLAN (IEEE 802.11b/a/g) becomes more and more popular as WLAN devices
become cheaper and more organizations provide WLAN access to their staff or to
the public. Almost every new laptop computer has an embedded WLAN card and
older ones may use a PCMCIA WLAN card; even desktop computers may have
USB WLAN cards or even on-board WLAN cards. On the other hand, WLAN Access
Points (AP) are deployed on campuses, office buildings, hotels, residences
and so on. The WLAN facilitates the deployment of local networks and supports
mobile/nomadic computing, which is another revolution to our
working and daily life.

</p><p>Thus, in the Linux world, it is also essential to support WLAN access. The
rest of this article is organized as follows: let's consider how to
drive the cards first; then try to access networks using
authentication; and give a brief introduction of the tools for
WLAN interface configuration; in the end, we will draw a conclusion.

</p><A NAME="361lfindex1">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Driving WLAN Cards</H2>

<p>Once you get a Wireless LAN card installed in your computer, the first step to
do is to install the driver and make it work. A WLAN card implements the
functions of the physical layer (PHY) and media access control sublayer (MAC)
as specified in at least one of the IEEE 802.11 series of protocols, while the
driver controls the card, provides a network interface identical to
an ethernet interface, and provides other WLAN specific management
interfaces.

</p><p>There is no unified method to install drivers for the diverse number of vendors and cards.
However, most of them can be driven through three methods:
</p><ul>
<li>Use the Linux® kernel's native support for the card,</li>
<li>To compile and install a driver module for the specified card,</li>
<li>To employ the NDIS wrapper [1] to drive cards using drivers for MS
Windows ®.</li>
</ul>
In the following sections, the author will illustrate these methods with
examples.

<p>Note, even if you use one of the latter two methods, you must make sure
that the wireless LAN support has been set in the kernel configuration:
</p><pre class="code">gnawux@APTITUDE:~$ grep CONFIG_NET_RADIO /boot/config-`uname -r`
CONFIG_NET_RADIO=y
</pre>
If not, you should reconfigure the kernel and enable the option "Wireless LAN
(non-hamradio) Drivers and Wireless Extensions".

<A NAME="361lfindex2">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Kernel support for WLAN</H3>

<p>The drivers that are mature enough and that don't have license issues are
introduced into the Linux Kernel. Therefore, the supported WLAN cards list
in kernel is dependent on the version of kernel, and it is smart to check
whether the new kernel has better support for your card before you
install the driver.

</p><p>In this section, the author will illustrate how to use  the
driver for WLAN cards based on the Intersil Prism
chipsets (ISL38xx). The supported cards list can be found
at http://prism54.org [2].

</p><p>To use a  Prism based card, you need the latest 2.6 kernel, and enable
the "Intersil Prism GT/Duette/Indigo PCI/Cardbus" option in the Wireless LAN
driver section of the kernel configuration, and re-build the
kernel.

</p><p>If you read the help text of the module carefully when you configure
the kernel, you may find that you need to get a firmware from the <a href="http://prism54.org/">prism54.org project website</a> [2]. This is
because the card does not have an EPROM to store its firmware. Therefore, it needs to download the firmware when
the driver is initializing the card. The firmware can not be part of the
kernel  because of a license issue.
After getting the firmware and putting it into
"/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/", reboot your computer, and you will find that you
have an additional ethernet interface provided by the WLAN card.

</p><A NAME="361lfindex3">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Independent Modules for Specific WLAN Cards</H3>

<p>Many new cards, just like other new hardware, have no GPL-compatible
drivers provided by the vendors, or the drivers developed by the open
source community have not become mature enough to be included in the kernel. Thus,
these drivers are provided as modules, and some of them will eventually be added into
future kernels when they are completed.

</p><p>One of the most famous drivers is <a href="http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/">ipw2100</a> [3] for the Intel Pro/Wireless
2100 card, which is a part of the Intel Centrino® technology and
installed in many laptop computers. In this section, the author will
introduce the installation of the ipw2100 driver.

</p><p>Firstly, you need to download the source package of the driver as well
as the firmware from the project web site, <a href="http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/">http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net</a>.
After making sure your kernel is recent enough and built with support for
modules, hotplug firmware, and wireless LAN as said above, uncompress the
source package:
</p><pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src# tar -zxvf ipw2100-1.0.1.tgz
</pre>
Then go into the source directory to build and install it:
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src/ipw2100-1.0.1# make
APTITUDE:/usr/src/ipw2100-1.0.1# make install
</pre>
Having installed the modules, it indicates that you need to install the
firmware:
<pre class="code">Don't forget to copy firmware to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/ and have the
hotplug tools in place.
</pre>
Just as the message says: uncompress the firmware into the hotplug
directory, then the installation procedure is completed. Now you can enable
the ipw2100 module by doing:
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src/ipw2100-1.0.1# modprobe ipw2100
</pre>
And you may add some parameters here for different configurations. For
instance, the ifname parameter can specify the interface name:
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src/ipw2100-1.0.1# modprobe ipw2100 ifname=wlan0
</pre>
Thus the interface will be named as wlan0. For other parameters, you can
read the documents in the source package of the ipw2100 driver.

<A NAME="361lfindex4">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Driving other cards</H3>

<p>Unfortunately, some cards have no drivers for Linux at all or the
driver does not work for a certain reason. However, this does not mean that we
cannot use it under Linux. At least, we have <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">NDIS wrapper</a> [1].

</p><p>Most of the WLAN cards for desktop or laptop computers support Windows
2000/XP, which handles the WLAN support by a standard interface
called NDIS. Therefore, the drivers for such cards usually support
NDIS. Thus we can wrap such a driver and let it work under
Linux as if it was Windows 2000/XP, which leads us to the ndiswrapper project.

</p><p>In this section, the author will install the ndiswrapper for a Netgear
121 WLAN card as an example. Firstly, you should download the ndiswrapper
from the project site, <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net</a>
and prepare the NDIS driver for Windows. The ndiswrapper consists of a
kernel module and a set of tools. You should build and install it:
</p><pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src/ndiswrapper-0.11# make install
</pre>
Then you can load the windows driver in the wrapper
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src/ndiswrapper-0.11# ndiswrapper -i ../wg121/WG121V200/ndis5/netwg121.inf
</pre>
where the <tt>.inf</tt> file is the NDIS driver for Windows. Having installed
the NDIS driver, you may see
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/usr/src/ndiswrapper-0.11# ndiswrapper -l
Installed ndis drivers:
netwg121        driver present
</pre>
<p>Cheers! The installation procedure is completed.

</p><A NAME="361lfindex5">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Authentication</H2>

<p>If you access a WLAN in some public environment, the WLAN
may require some authentication methods for security
reasons. Most of the available authentication methods for WLAN are
based on IEEE 802.1x (EAP) and IEEE 802.11i, and EAP based methods are
currently the most popular.

</p><p>There are many EAP based authentication methods, e.g. EAP-MD5,
EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM, LEAP, etc. Linux users can use
<i>xsupplicant</i> provided by the <a href="http://open1x.sourceforge.net/">Open1x project</a> [4]
to access a network that requires 802.1x based authentication. In this
section, the author will use the LEAP protocol, which is proposed by Cisco
corp., as an illustration. Note: whether the protocol can be supported is
dependent on the
card and the driver, i.e. even if your xsupplicant is correctly installed and
configured, you may still be unable to access the network because
of the card or
driver not supporting it.

</p><p>You should download <i>xsupplicant</i> from the project site, <a href="http://open1x.sourceforge.net/">http://open1x.sourceforge.net</a>,
and install it. Then modify the configuration file,
/etc/xsupplicant/xsupplicant.conf. Here is an example for LEAP.
</p><pre class="code">#example of /etc/xsupplicant/xsupplicant.conf
#for LEAP protocol

network_list = all
#the list of networks to access

default_netname = default
#the default access network

first_auth_command = &lt;BEGIN_COMMAND&gt;dhclient %i&lt;END_COMMAND&gt;
#The command before authentication, which is usually used to get some info from
#the network

logfile = /var/log/xsupplicant.log
#log file

myssid #here is your network id, may be listed in the network list
{
  type = wireless
  ssid = &lt;BEGIN_SSID&gt;myssid&lt;END_SSID&gt;
  allow_types = all
  identity = &lt;BEGIN_ID&gt;aptitude&lt;END_ID&gt;
  eap-leap {
      username = &lt;BEGIN_UNAME&gt;aptitude&lt;END_UNAME&gt;
      password = &lt;BEGIN_PASS&gt;passwd&lt;END_PASS&gt;
  }#setup for leap
}

</pre>
LEAP is a simple authentication method, and there are many other
settings for other methods, please refer to the examples and documents from
xsupplicant.

<H2>Utilities for WLAN</H2>

<p>As you know, WLAN provides an network interface identical to ethernet,
and you can use it as another ethernet interface. On the other hand, a
WLAN card has much more features than a ethernet card because of the
wireless media. Thus there is a set of tools to configure WLAN and
obtain information about the status of it. You can find the wireless tools
from <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html">http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html</a>
[5], which is contributed by Jean Tourrilhes.

</p><p>The most useful tool is <i>iwconfig</i>, which can be used similar to
ifconfig. The iwconfig command without any parameters but the interface name will
print the working status of the card:
</p><pre class="code">gnawux@APTITUDE:~$ /sbin/iwconfig wlan0
wlan0     unassociated  ESSID:off/any  Nickname:"ipw2100"
          Mode:Managed  Channel=0  Access Point: 00:00:00:00:00:00
          Bit Rate=0 kb/s   Tx-Power:off
          Retry:on   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off
          Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

</pre>
With the "mode" parameter, you can change the WLAN card working mode:
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/home/gnawux# iwconfig wlan0 mode 1
APTITUDE:/home/gnawux# iwconfig wlan0
wlan0     unassociated  ESSID:off/any  Nickname:"ipw2100"
          Mode:Ad-Hoc  Channel=0  Cell: 00:00:00:00:00:00
          Bit Rate=0 kb/s   Tx-Power:off
          Retry:on   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off
          Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

</pre>
Here we change the WLAN card into "Ad Hoc" mode. We can also change
the network name through the "essid" parameter:
<pre class="code">APTITUDE:/home/gnawux# iwconfig wlan0 essid gnawux
APTITUDE:/home/gnawux# iwconfig wlan0
wlan0     IEEE 802.11b  ESSID:"gnawux"  Nickname:"ipw2100"
          Mode:Ad-Hoc  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Cell: 02:0C:F1:0F:11:2A
          Bit Rate=0 kb/s   Tx-Power:off
          Retry:on   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off
          Link Quality=60/100  Signal level=-83 dBm
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0

</pre>
You maybe have noticed that we have now more reasonable status info than
before because we have a valid ESSID. For other parameters of iwconfig,
please read iwconfig(8).

<p>Another powerful utility is <i>iwlist</i>, with which we can get the list
of available resources. With the "scanning" parameter, we can obtain a list
of the available access points:
</p><pre class="code">gnawux@APTITUDE:~$ /sbin/iwlist wlan0 scanning
wlan0     Scan completed :
          Cell 01 - Address: 00:0D:BD:6F:B4:48
                    ESSID:"&lt;hidden&gt;"
                    Protocol:IEEE 802.11b

And with the "frequency" parameter (<tt>freq</tt>), we can get the frequency list:
<pre class="code">gnawux@APTITUDE:~$ /sbin/iwlist wlan0 freq
wlan0     14 channels in total; available frequencies :
          Channel 01 : 2.412 GHz
          Channel 02 : 2.417 GHz
          Channel 03 : 2.422 GHz
          Channel 04 : 2.427 GHz
          Channel 05 : 2.432 GHz
          Channel 06 : 2.437 GHz
          Channel 07 : 2.442 GHz
          Channel 08 : 2.447 GHz
          Channel 09 : 2.452 GHz
          Channel 10 : 2.457 GHz

And you can refer to iwlist(8) for other parameters.

<p>Besides the above two, there are other utilities, e.g. iwevent,
iwgetid, iwpriv, iwspy, for you to obtain the working status of your WLAN
card and manage it.
