<H2>Creating panoramic views using hugin, enblend and The
    Gimp</H2>


    <p>I have always been impressed when I saw a picture displaying
    a panoramic view. Still I don't owe a camera with a panorama
    function. But it's not necessary. With Linux all things are
    possible and you can create great panoramic views by using
    hugin, enblend and The Gimp.<br>
     Hugin stitches the pictures together and sometimes what it
    produces alone is already satisfying. Most of the time however
    you will want to improve the result further. Enblend tries to
    make the result more seamless. Finally to give your image the
    final touch you manipulate it with the Gimp.<br>
     The versions used for this article are hugin 0.4 pre, enblend
    1.3 and The Gimp 2.0</p>

<H2>Choosing your pictures</H2>


    <p>Okay, let's see how it works. Here you see a couple of
    images of Montr&eacute;al that were taken from the Mont Royal
    sometime in April this year.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
     <br>
     I'll tell you the steps I took to get a panoramic picture out
    of them so that you can apply this to your own works.<br>
     First I created a new directory and sorted the images I wanted
    to use in there. This is not really necessary of course but I
    find it easier this way. As far as I know you can't sort your
    pictures within Hugin but have to add them in the right
    order.<br>
     You need to choose your images carefully as the quality of the
    output image depends very much on them. Make sure that they
    were taken from the same distance so that the objects they show
    are almost the same size in the different pictures. And of
    course the pictures need to overlap at least a little bit (it's
    recommended that they overlap at least 20-30%). <br>
     <br>


    <A NAME="348lfindex2">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Hugin</H2>


    <p>Okay, after choosing your pictures you start hugin and add
    your images under "Images". Click on "Add individual images"
    and choose the directory with your images. If you have sorted
    them into one directory you can select them all at once by
    pressing ctrl while clicking on each picture. Otherwise you can
    select them individually. You get a preview of your image if
    you select it. This way you can check that you really selected
    the right images. Sometimes it is good to select one of the
    pictures as an anchor point for position, this will then be
    kind of a basis to align the other pictures around this
    anchor.<br>
    <br>
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="../../common/images2/article348/huginimages.png"
      hspace="20" width="400" height="379" alt="[hugin]">
    </center>
    <br>
     <br>
     Now you change to "Cameras and Lens". Select one of the
    images. In many cases this will fill out the "Design
    Parameters" automatically. If not you need to fill in the
    "degrees of views" with a number of around 40 (hugin filled
    this field with the value 41.112 in my case). This is the
    degree of view that most "normal" digital cameras are using.
    The lens type usually is "Normal (rectlinear) and the values of
    the focal length hugin filled in as 12.48 and the crop factor
    as 3.8. That way you have some values in case your camera isn't
    detected. If you have a special camera you should consult your
    manual or play a bit around with different values. <br>
     <br>
     Next you go to the "Control Points". This is the place where
    you spend most of your time. Make sure that you have "auto fine
    tune" and "auto add" checked. This way hugin will help you set
    the control points correctly and correct them a bit if
    necessary. <br>
     <br>


    <center>
      <img src=
      "../../common/images2/article348/hugincontrolpoints.png"
      hspace="20" width="400" height="379" alt="[control points]">
    </center>
    <br>
     <br>
     Now on top you see a list with the image numbers. Select 0 on
    the left and 1 on the right to see the first two pictures.
    Click on a significant point in the picture on the left, then
    look for the same point in the image on the right. If your
    second click is out of bounce Hugin will tell you so and you
    can reclick. Usually you will need 3 or 4 points. Hugin uses
    them to see where the two images overlap. So if it is a
    difficult images you may need more control points. After
    clicking on those points you get a text like "found
    corresponding point, mean xcorr coefficient: 0.987115".
    Unfortunately a new point not always improves the value so you
    may want to delete a point again by clicking on "delete" below.
    For selecting good points for Hugin you should try to select
    sharp points and those that have lots of contrast. Also avoid
    points too close to the edge and if you have a panorama with
    things in the foreground it is said to avoid selecting objects
    there to avoid parallax. You can also enlarge the size in which
    you view the picture to 100% or more to select the points more
    precisely. <br>
     <br>
     Now before continuing with the next pair of images first go to
    "Optimizer", let the default "Optimize positions (pairwise...)
    as is and click on "Optimize now!". Then return to the "Control
    Points" section and repeat the whole procedure (click left on
    image 1 and right on image 2 to select the next pair etc.)
    until you worked through all the images. After optimizing the
    last pair you go to the "Stitcher" section.<br>
     <br>
     Let's start from below. There you need to decide which image
    format to use for your output file. If you don't want to use
    enblend you can choose jpg, png or tiff. If you want to enhance
    your picture with enblend afterwards which will usually be the
    case you have to choose "multiple tiff" here. This way you
    don't get one finished image but as many pictures as you had
    previously given into hugin.<br>
     Next you need to choose the Stitching engine. By default the
    field says "PTStitcher" but if you haven't installed this
    explicitely you need to choose "nona" here.<br>
     Click on "Calculate Optimal Size" and on "Calculate Field of
    View". You have almost made it.<br>
     Before you hit "Stitch now" you only need to decide whether
    your output should be a rectilinear, a cylindrical or an
    equirectangular. If you only stitch two images together
    rectilinear will be the right choice, if you have several
    pictures but no 360 degree view cylindrical will probably the
    right choice and for an all-around view you choose
    equirectangular. The thing is that if you make the wrong
    decision here hugin will either stop with an error (if you want
    an eqirectangular view while the input is only for rectangular
    for example) or the result will look strange (if the result
    should be cylindircal while you chose rectilinear for
    example).<br>
     After clicking in "Stitch now!" hugin asks you to specify an
    output file and then starts stitching the images together. This
    will take some time so you should go and have a cup of tea
    while phoning with your grandmother. <br>
     The images you'll get will look similar to this one:<br>
     <br>

    <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>


    <A NAME="348lfindex3">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Enblend</H2>


    <p>Now it's time for Enblend to do its part of the work.
    Enblend works directly from the shell so open a shell and
    type<br>
    <br>
     enblend -v -o output.tif input1.tif input2.tif...<br>
    <br>
     where output.tif specifies the file you want the result to be
    saved in and input1.tif stands for the first image etc.<br>
    <br>
     After hitting return you can pour a second cup of tea and
    again phone any of your relatives or maybe even two as this
    really takes a long time. Well, of course if you only have 2
    pictures it is rather fast but with more pictures this is
    really slow. But well, the result is definitively worth
    it...</p>

    <br>
     <br>


    <A NAME="348lfindex4">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>The Gimp</H2>


    <p>If you look at your image now you already have a panoramic
    view. Still you need The Gimp to give your panorama the final
    touch. With Hugin and Enblend you usually get a picture with
    some empty spaces. If you don't know The Gimp well or don't
    want to spend much time you can simply select the part of the
    image that has no empty space with the rectangular selection
    tool <img src=
    "../../common/images2/article348/rectangularselectiontool.png"
    hspace="20" width="33" height="27" alt="[rectangular selection tool]">, right click in the image
    on Edit--&gt;Copy and then File--&gt;New. A new file opens,
    then Edit--&gt;Paste and File--&gt;Save as to save this new
    picture.<br>
     But often it is also possible to fill the gaps by using the
    clone tool <img src=
    "../../common/images2/article348/clonetool.png" hspace="20"
    width="31" height="28" alt="[clone tool]"> in combination with blur <img src=
    "../../common/images2/article348/blurtool.png" hspace="20"
    width="31" height="29" alt="[blur tool]">. You first apply the clone tool
    carefully. It's always good to work on a copy here
    (Image--&gt;Duplicate) as you might want to discard your
    changes especially if you are not very experienced with this
    tool. If you have selected the clone tool you click with your
    mouse in the area that is to be cloned while you hold the
    Ctrl-key down.Then you release the key and click with the mouse
    in the area that you want to paint over. Now you can use the
    clone tool the same way you would use a paint brush. Sometimes
    you will get a more natural looking picture if you define a new
    cloning area several times.<br>
     Finally to get rid of the seams that are still there even
    though they shouldn't be that big you click on the blur tool
    and work with the mouse along the seam until you are satisfied.
    Then you can save the picture. Of course it is also possible to
    fill in some gaps and cut the rest.<br>
    <br>
     The panorama is ready. If you want you can try to improve the
    quality of your image by using the tools I described in my
    article <a href=
    "../../English/September2003/article311.shtml">
    Photo magic with Gimp</a><br>

        The Hugin website is: <a href=
        "http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">http://hugin.sourceforge.net/</a><br>

         There you can download Hugin and also find some useful
        tutorials.<br>
         The installation of hugin is a bit complex because it
        depends on a lot of other non standard packages.

        <p>The best solution is probably to install one of the
        pre-compiled rpm packages from<br>
         <a href=
        "http://bugbear.blackfish.org.uk/~bruno/panorama-tools/">http://bugbear.blackfish.org.uk/~bruno/panorama-tools/</a><br>

        <br>
         To use PTStitcher you need the panorama-tools-nonfree
        package. Otherwise you can use the nona stitcher.</p>

        <p>Those who would like to install from the source will
        need the following dependent packages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hugin is a gui frontend for the panotools therefore
          you need the panotools tools from
          http://panotools.sourceforge.net/ The panotools tools,
          also called panorama-tools, have the following
          dependencies: jdk-1.3.1 (from www.javasoft.com) and the
          following libraries which should be part of most linux
          systems: libjpeg libtiff libpng zlib<br>
          <br>
          </li>

          <li>wxGTK GUI package http://www.wxwindows.org/</li>

          <li>fftw Fast Fourier Transform library
          http://www.fftw.org/</li>

          <li>boost development library http://boost.org/</li>

          <li>vigra computer vision library
          http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~koethe/vigra/
          Vigra is needed to build the hugin stitcher 'nona'</li>
        </ul>
        Finally you need hugin of course which can be downloaded
        at: http://hugin.sourceforge.net/
      </li>

      <li>Enblend is available at <a href=
      "http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mihal/enblend/">http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mihal/enblend/</a><br>

       You can download enblend there and can also learn more about
      how it does what it does.<br>
       The installation of enblend is straightforward.</li>

      <li>The Gimp will probably already be installed on your
      computer as it is shipped with most distributions. Probably
      you have already worked with it lots of time. But anyway, its
      webpage is: <a href=
      "http://www.gimp.org/">http://www.gimp.org</a><br>
      </li>

      <li>And finally if you are interested in reading more of my
      articles you can find them all at my newly redesigned webpage
      <a href=
