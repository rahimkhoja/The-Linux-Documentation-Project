<H4>ArticleBody:[The main part of the article]</H4>

<h2>How to write the article?</H2>
Just copy and paste your article below the ArticleBody heading.
Your own headings must be on level &lt;H2&gt; or &lt;H3&gt;.
Apart from that you can use any html tags. Everything above the ArticleBody
heading is specific to this template and must not be changed with regards
to its structure.

<h2>What is the template format?</H2>

<p>At _LF_ we use an internal html file format. This is a very
simple html file which can then easily be converted into the final
article format. We call this template format also meta file format.
Everything is done using this format. You must submit your article
in this simplified format. Do not try to use final article format which
we use to publish the article. Courious what the converter does to
this article? Just <a href="new001.shtml">click here</a> to look at it.
</p>

<P>You are encouraged to include images and code examples where needed.
Make sure that images are generally not wider than 600 pixel otherwise
readers will have difficulties to print the article.
Pre-formatted lines (html &lt;pre&gt;) must not be longer than 75 characters
otherwise there will again be a problem when printing the article.
</p>

<p>
Code examples can  be put into a blue box. To get such a blue box
use the html tag &lt;pre class="code"&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;. An example of this can
be seen in the paragraph below.
</p>

<H2>What article categories are available?</H2>
<p>
Under the keyword &lt;H4&gt;ArticleCategory:&lt;/H4&gt; (see above) you define the
category your article belongs to.<br>
The ArticleCategory can have one of the following values:<br>
