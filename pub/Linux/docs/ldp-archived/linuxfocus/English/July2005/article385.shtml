    <A NAME="385lfindex0">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Clustering</H2>


    <p><em>The art of having a couple of commodity computer systems
    behave as one</em>.</p>

    <p>This, in essence, is what clustering is all about.<br>
    So why would you want to do that?</p>

    <p>Well, 2 possible reasons here:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dd>You don't have enough processing power (nor enough
          money to get it), so you combine some cheap boxes to get
          the power just the same.</dd>
        </dl>
      </li>

      <li>
        <dl>
          <dd style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">There's some critical
          programs running on your system and you <em>really</em>
          can't afford to have system downtime (time is money).
          Hence, you devise a configuration whereby a commodity
          computer (or part thereof) may fail but the system as a
          whole stays up (high availability).</dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first issue is in the realm of universities and R&amp;D
    departments. They never have enough funds but they
    <strong>do</strong> need the processing power. Projects like <a
    href="http://www.beowulf.org/">beowulf</a> or <a href=
    "http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/">ParallelKnoppix</a>
    take care of these.</p>

    <p>The second issue is more in the realm of companies (or
    <em>enterprises</em>). Funding is usually not a problem but
    system downtime <em>is</em>.<br>
    Imagine having your development department of 60-odd people
    waiting on the system to become available again. Or an office
    of dozens of <span lang="en-US">administrative</span> staff,
    waiting for the database to come up again. System downtime can
    thus become very expensive and that's where this book comes
    in.</p>

    <p>The book focuses on building <em>enterprise class</em>
    clusters -which is synonym for highly available- that will keep
    on going.<br>
    In many ways, this is a very unforgiving book. Don't expect any
    airy-fairy talk on the theories behind clustering or high
    availability. This book gets right down to business: build the
    damned thing and do your maintenance on it.</p>

    <p>So if you're looking for some abstract, high-level
    introduction into highly available systems, stop right here and
    go look somewhere else. You will not find it here.</p>

    <p>If, however, you have the boss breathing down your neck
    right now screaming: &ldquo;The system is down again and it is
    costing me a fortune! What the hell am I paying you
    for!?&rdquo; then this is the book you'll need.<br>
    So read on, for some more details.</p>

    <A NAME="385lfindex1">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>History</H2>


    <p>Legend has it that the computer company <dfn>HP</dfn>
    (formerly known as <dfn>Compaq</dfn>, formerly known as
    <dfn>Digital Equipment Corporation</dfn>, &ldquo;what's in a
    name?&rdquo;) could not, in those days of mini- and mainframe
    computers, come up with a processor <span lang=
    "en-US">rivaling</span> the power of the IBM mainframe
    processors. Hence they came up with the idea of clustering
    their minicomputers so that they could offer customers
    something that <span lang="en-US">rivaled</span> the
    mainframe-bids.</p>

    <p>I doubt whether they ever persuaded an IBM customer with
    this scheme but they <em>did</em> find something else. That if
    a minicomputer crashed or went down, the others would still
    function. The worst that could happen was that a user would
    have to login again because he was attached to the crashing
    computer. A highly available system was born.</p>

    <p>Now I'm not sure how much of this is true and/or urban
    legend, but it's a nice story so I'll stick with it until a
    better story comes along.</p>

    <p>Clustering is a specialised and complex matter. This is
    proven by the fact that no commercial Unix-vendor has -until
    now- come up with a clustering-solution that could rival the
    (Open)VMS solution (yes, not even the Unix systems of Digital
    itself were up to par with the VMS clusters). And now the open
    source community has a stab at it.</p>

    <A NAME="385lfindex2">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>The book</H2>


    <p>Has a bit of an odd build-up. You would expect it to start
    with a general description of what the goal is, some background
    and theory and then gradually moving down to the bits-and-bytes
    stuff.<br>
    Not this book. This one states: &ldquo;We're going to build us
    a cluster, and this is the recipe:...&rdquo;. And so part one
    starts with some Linux basics like compiling kernels,
    installing packages and basic network configuration, that
    you'll need to master before a next building step is taken.</p>

    <p>That next step essentially contains more basics, but now
    focused on packages and configurations that deal with high
    availability. Included here are subjects like system cloning,
    the heartbeat package and <tt>stonith</tt>-devices.</p>

    <p>Part 3 then combines all these basics to implement highly
    available clusters using load-balancing. And here, finally,
    everything comes together, with some added cluster-theory as
    well (we're by now almost 200 pages into the book already).</p>

    <p>The final part deals with how to keep a cluster running. How
    to administer maintenance and monitor it's performance.</p>

    <p>So, like I said, a bit of an odd build-up but then again,
    who said you need to read a book sequentially, front to
    back?</p>

    <A NAME="385lfindex3">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>The verdict</H2>


    <p>If anything, this is a <strong>practical</strong> book.<br>
    I can see a battered copy of it, always lying around in the
    server room. Battered, because it is so frequently referenced
    by the sysadmins in maintaining their clusters. Like a cookbook
    indeed.</p>

    <p>This practicality can for instance be seen in the
    substantial part (4) that is devoted to cluster maintenance and
    monitoring. Where many a book would stop once a
    cluster-configuration has been built, this book does not forget
    that all-important phase that follows after implementation.</p>

    <p>Another indication is the tremendous amount of notes,
    footnotes, tips and tricks that this book is littered with.<br>
    What about a gem like (page 322): &ldquo;<cite>You can write a
    script that calls another script, but just be sure to pass the
    exit status of the child script back as the exit status of the
    main script or SNMPD will not see it</cite>&rdquo;.<br>
    You can only come up with these kind of notes once you have
    experienced them yourself and bumped your head on them
    before.<br>
    And this book <em>oozes</em> that kind of blood, sweat and
    tears. I can well imagine the author, for months hacking away
    at installing and configuring new systems, finding out what
    problems there are, trying to solve them or come up with other
    alternatives. All the while meticulously making notes of every
    glitch or <span lang="en-US">problem</span> he encounters.</p>

    <p>And finally, definitive proof was given just a few days ago,
    after reading the book, when I could help a <span lang=
    "en-US">colleague</span> with a problem by pointing to some
    <span lang="en-US">excerpts</span> from the book.</p>

    <A NAME="385lfindex4">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>In conclusion</H2>


    <p>The practicality of this book is also one of its weaknesses.
    It will not age well. A lot will need to be rewritten in 2 -3
    years due to ongoing developments in the open source community,
    configuration changes etc.<br>
    Then again, you don't buy a book only to use it years from
    now.</p>

    <p>In addition, the book contains a <span lang=
    "en-US">handful</span> of appendices and a complementary CD-ROM
    with more on downloading, troubleshooting, configuring,
    packages and scripts, enough for you to experiment with
    clustering to your hearts content.<br>
    What I would <em>really</em> like though (hint hint) is for the
    author, after this landmark work, to take the book and
    knowledge gained a step further and come up with a complete
    distribution. Something like <em>EnterpriseKnoppix</em>,
    containing all the goodies needed to make a highly available
    cluster.</p>
