Happy new millennium! [again <a href="../January2000/index.html">:-)</a> ]

World domination? What does it mean? Most people would probably say that this
goal is reached when more than 50% of all computers are running on Linux.
Which computers? Desktops, servers, embedded systems, all? 
</p>
<p>
Another approach would be to say that the dominating Operating System is
the standard Operating System. Hmmm, what is now a standard in this context?
How about: A standard is a set of characteristics that everybody tries to implement
in order to be standard compliant. Recently I heard a windows fanatic
say that there are more similarities between Win2000 and Linux than
between Win98 and Win2000. For Linux it could mean that competition has become
tougher but it means also that Microsoft is trying to implement features
that were previously only attributes of Linux and Unix in general.
<br>Apple's OS X is very similar to Linux, not only from a conceptual
point of view.
<br>Last but not least there is this statement from Sun CEO 
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/filters/printerfriendly/0,6061,2662720-54,00.html">Scott McNealy</a> saying that &quot;Solaris is our implementation of 
Linux&quot;. Think about it! A year ago nobody would have dreamed about
such a statement. What is now world domination? I don't know, but I have
the feeling that we are on the right track.
</p>
<p>
You might have noticed the PDA converter buttons in the corner of every 
new article. This makes it easy to read LinuxFocus at the bus stop,
in the Underground, in the bathroom. The generated output
should work with most PDA document readers (e.g <a href="../../common/src/pda/index.html">Freeware iSilo, Open Source Gutenpalm</a>). 
The converted pages should work on most PDAs,
not only with Palm Pilots.
Happy reading.

<h4> <font color="#660033"> The LinuxFocus Tip</font></h4>

<p>You want convert your old analog audio tapes into an audio CD?
....or just record your sister playing piano on audio CD-rom?
<br>
<br>
Here is how to do that under Linux. All you need is a recordable CD, a 
CDRW-drive, a sound card and the programs nrecord and cdrecord. nrecord is a utility to record
analog sound to WAV files at a sample rate of 44100 in 16 bit stereo.
This is exactly the format you need to make audio CD-ROMs. nrecord
is part of a software package called wavnorm and is available
from the author's home page (<a href="http://www.zog.net.au/computers/wavnorm/">www.zog.net.au/computers/wavnorm</a>) or from the LinuxFocus server
(<a href="../../common/src/wavnorm-0.4.tar.gz">wavnorm-0.4.tar.gz</a> was at print time the latest version).
<br>
With the help of nrecord you record each song into an own WAV file
(e.g song01.wav, song02.wav ... etc). It is a good idea to give the files
names which sort alphabetically in right order (the order in which
you want them on the CD).
<br>
Next you just burn an audio CD-ROM using cdrecord. SCSI CDRW-drives are
the best and the most easiest to use under Linux. IDE CDRW-drives work as well
but the installation is a bit more complicated.<br>
The command to write the CD is:
<pre>
cdrecord  -v dev=0,4,0 speed=2 -pad -audio song*.wav
</pre>
The dev= parameter describes the SCSI device 
(or virtual SCSI device in case of IDE) where your cdburner
is located. You can obtain this parameter by running:
<pre>
cdrecord -scanbus
</pre>
<br>
Happy recording!
