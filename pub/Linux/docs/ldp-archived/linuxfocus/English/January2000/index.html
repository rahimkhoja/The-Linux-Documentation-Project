Welcome to the new Millennium. Looking back at 1999 it is really breath
taking what Linux has achieved. Linux Weekly News has published a 1999
<a href="http://lwn.net/1999/features/Timeline/">time line</a>.
1999 was the year of the 2.2 Kernel, Gnome, a very stable KDE and of course
the public offerings of RedHat, Cobalt Networks, VA Linux and a few other
Linux related companies.
<br>
The Gnome and KDE have very much changed the perception that Linux is
only a Server platform and the public offerings have brought a lot of
attention to Linux. 2 years ago it was often necessary to explain first
what Linux is. Now suddenly everyone seems have heard about Linux.
<br>
The Linux market is growing exponentially and I am quite sure 
that this year will be even more exciting than previous years.
<br>
<br>
Despite the excitement we need to be alert. A patent lasts 20 years and
that is a very long
time in the software world. Especially in the software world
more and more patents get filed for rather
simple things. Originally patents were made to protect investment in
years of research and development. Today software patents are mostly filed
for obvious ideas and sometimes even techniques that are already in use.
These patents can block innovation and wide spread use
for a long time.
Software patents are especially a problem for developers of free software as
a patent basically makes it impossible to implement that idea as free
software. Richard Stallman has <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazon.html">called for a boycott</a> 
against Amazon.com. Amazon, it seems, is trying to use its patent for
&quot;one click ordering&quot; against competitor Barnes & Noble. 
The great innovative step of Amazon's patent is to store private data in a 
web-browser cookie. A technique for which cookies were made after all.

Among the revolutionary tools of NeXTStep, the first in order of

Thanks to the path-view in that File Manager you always knew where you were.
It was more than a manager, it was a true browser.
FSViewer is a NeXTStep a like File Manager for WindowMaker.

<p>The Linux EXT2 file system usually gets a forced
file system check after 20 mount counts. On todays big partitions
such a file system check can take several minutes. 
Home and desktop computers are switched on and off more often
than server machines. As a regular computer user you may therefore see the
message <tt>... has reached maximum mount count, check forced</tt>
several times a week.
</p>
<p>
A file system check once in a while is a good idea but once every
week or two may be too much for you. Here is how you can increase the
max mount count for your partitions.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>First rule: Never use tune2fs on a mounted file system.
Get a rescue software for Linux such as the tomsrtbt from
<a href="http://www.toms.net/rb/">www.toms.net/rb/</a>. Tomsrtbt is 
a Linux system on just one floppy. You can boot from it and then
use the tune2fs as described below.<br>You may also download 
the <a href="../../common/src/January2000/tomsrtbt-1.6.362.tar.gz">tomsrtbt-1.6.362.tar.gz</a> or <a href="../../common/src/January2000/tomsrtbt-1.7.185.tar.gz">tomsrtbt-1.7.185.tar.gz</a> directly from here. Unpack the file. Installation
instructions are included.
<li>Once you have booted from the rescue disk you can run the
command <br><tt>fdisk -l</tt><br> to see all your partitions.
<li>Run the command <br><tt>dumpe2fs /dev/YourDev | grep Max</tt><br>
to see what the current max mount count on a given partition is.
Replace the YourDev by the appropriate device (e.g hda5). 
<li>To change the maximum mount count to a higher value (e.g 50) use
<br><tt>tune2fs -c 50 /dev/YourDev </tt><br> 
<li>Run the above tune2fs command for all your hard disk partitions which
are marked as &quot;Linux native&quot;.
You can also change the mount count value a bit for every partition (e.g 50, 60, 70...). That
way not all partitions get a forced check at once.
</OL>
