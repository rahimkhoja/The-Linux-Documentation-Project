<h1>About LinuxFocus.org</h1>

<p>LinuxFocus first appeared in Nov. 1997. It was started by Miguel
   Angel Sepulveda and some friends when they realized that the
amount of support and documentation for the Linux fans in non-English 
speaking countries was close to none.
</p><p>
Although most of us were able to read English news groups,
HOWTOS and books, we felt that providing information of this
nature in a non-English language was very important. Most young
people in non-English speaking countries rarely speak or read
English, their first experience with a computer operating system
likely comes from the hand of Micro...  MS sells their
distribution in almost all languages imaginable. Commercial
Linux distributors are not even near that level.
</p><p>
Our fundamental goal is then pedagogical. To reach a new
generation of users and to provide enough information in their
native language so that they can join in the Linux community.

  is the founder of the LinuxFocus Magazine. He used to work as a Research
  Associate at the University of Pittsburgh working on polymer, gels and
  quantum phonon control. Miguel has a Ph. D. in theoretical chemistry. He
  likes animations, 3D programming and simulations.  He is Linux user
  since 1993.  In his very little free time he enjoys classical music and
  playing with his kids. In 1999 he quit the position as project leader
  for LinuxFocus.</P>

<p>
 The goal of LinuxFocus is to produce and publish a free online magazine
 about Linux and related issues in a number of languages. LinuxFocus is
 an open magazine, it is the joint effort of many people. Anyone can
 contribute interesting articles.
</p> 

<p>When Miguel Sepulveda left LinuxFocus, Guido Socher took over the
  project leader responsibility.

  Guido is a Linux-Fan since the first moment he installed it on his computer.
  He loves Linux because it is more than just a bit of software. It is a
  philosophy. Guido has a Master in Electrical Engineering and works 
  in the area of software design for a bigger telecommunications company.
  Recently he spends a lot of his spare time for LinuxFocus.

<p>LinuxFocus is definitely not a one person effort. 
 LinuxFocus lives and exists of course only because of all the 
 hundreds of contributes. We have a number of working groups for the
 different languages.
<br>Contact persons for each group and their corresponding e-mails  can
 be found at our <a href="../common/lfteam.html">lf-team web page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
 We hope you enjoy our magazine, and look forward to hearing from you.
