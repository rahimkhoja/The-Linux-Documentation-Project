Hi Guylhem,

(I've cc:'d to the ldp-discuss list and Lars so that everything is
out in the open)

Since you are the new leader of the LDP, we should update the
authoritative contact record for the linuxdoc.org domain so that it
lists you, and not Lars.

If you could fill out the blank lines on the form (marked &quot;X&quot;), I can
send the form into hostmaster@internic.net to make the changes.  (or
you can send the form in yourself)

I've also added on a new nameserver (cosmos.jimpick.com) for some
additional redundancy.

Cheers,

 - Jim

        NETWORK SOLUTIONS, INC.

        DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION AGREEMENT


A.      Introduction. This domain name registration agreement
(&quot;Registration Agreement&quot;) is submitted to NETWORK SOLUTIONS, INC.
(&quot;NSI&quot;) for the purpose of applying for and registering a domain name
on the Internet. If this Registration Agreement is accepted by NSI,
and a domain name is registered in NSI's domain name database and
assigned to the Registrant, Registrant (&quot;Registrant&quot;) agrees to be
bound by the terms of this Registration Agreement and the terms of
NSI's Domain Name Dispute Policy (&quot;Dispute Policy&quot;) which is
incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Registration
Agreement. This Registration Agreement shall be accepted at the
offices of NSI. 

B. Fees and Payments.

1) Registration or renewal (re-registration) date through March 31, 1998:
Registrant agrees to pay a registration fee of One Hundred United States
Dollars (US) as consideration for the registration of each new domain
name or Fifty United States Dollars (US) to renew (re-register) an
existing registration.
2) Registration or renewal date on and after April 1, 1998:  Registrant
agrees to pay a registration fee of Seventy United States Dollars (US) 
as consideration for the registration of each new domain name or the 
applicable renewal (re-registration) fee (currently Thirty-Five United 
States Dollars (US)) at the time of renewal (re-registration).
3) Period of Service:  The non-refundable fee covers a period of two (2)
years for each new registration, and one (1) year for each renewal, 
and includes any permitted modification(s) to the domain name record
during the covered period.
4) Payment:  Payment is due to Network Solutions within thirty (30) 
days from the date of the invoice.

C.      Dispute Policy. Registrant agrees, as a condition to
submitting this Registration Agreement, and if the Registration
Agreement is accepted by NSI, that the Registrant shall be bound by
NSI's current Dispute Policy. The current version of the Dispute
Policy may be found at the InterNIC Registration Services web site:
&quot;<A  HREF="http://www.netsol.com/rs/dispute-policy.html&quot">http://www.netsol.com/rs/dispute-policy.html&quot</A>;. 

D.      Dispute Policy Changes or Modifications. Registrant agrees
that NSI, in its sole discretion, may change or modify the Dispute
Policy, incorporated by reference herein, at any time. Registrant
agrees that Registrant's maintaining the registration of a domain name
after changes or modifications to the Dispute Policy become effective
constitutes Registrant's continued acceptance of these changes or
modifications. Registrant agrees that if Registrant considers any such
changes or modifications to be unacceptable, Registrant may request
that the domain name be deleted from the domain name database. 

E.      Disputes. Registrant agrees that, if the registration of its
domain name is challenged by any third party, the Registrant will be
subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy. 

F.      Agents. Registrant agrees that if this Registration Agreement
is completed by an agent for the Registrant, such as an ISP or
Administrative Contact/Agent, the Registrant is nonetheless bound as a
principal by all terms and conditions herein, including the Dispute
Policy. 

G.      Limitation of Liability. Registrant agrees that NSI shall have
no liability to the Registrant for any loss Registrant may incur in
connection with NSI's processing of this Registration Agreement, in
connection with NSI's processing of any authorized modification to the
domain name's record during the covered period, as a result of the
Registrant's ISP's failure to pay either the initial registration fee
or renewal fee, or as a result of the application of the provisions of
the Dispute Policy. Registrant agrees that in no event shall the
maximum liability of NSI under this Agreement for any matter exceed
Five Hundred United States Dollars (US). 

H.      Indemnity. Registrant agrees, in the event the Registration
Agreement is accepted by NSI and a subsequent dispute arises with any
third party, to indemnify and hold NSI harmless pursuant to the terms
and conditions contained in the Dispute Policy. 

I.      Breach. Registrant agrees that failure to abide by any
provision of this Registration Agreement or the Dispute Policy may be
considered by NSI to be a material breach and that NSI may provide a
written notice, describing the breach, to the Registrant. If, within
thirty (30) days of the date of mailing such notice, the Registrant
fails to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to NSI,
that it has not breached its obligations, then NSI may delete
Registrant's registration of the domain name. Any such breach by a
Registrant shall not be deemed to be excused simply because NSI did
not act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by the
Registrant. 

J.      No Guaranty. Registrant agrees that, by registration of a
domain name, such registration does not confer immunity from objection
to either the registration or use of the domain name. 

K.      Warranty. Registrant warrants by submitting this Registration
Agreement that, to the best of Registrant's knowledge and belief, the
information submitted herein is true and correct, and that any future
changes to this information will be provided to NSI in a timely manner
according to the domain name modification procedures in place at that
time. Breach of this warranty will constitute a material breach. 

L.      Revocation. Registrant agrees that NSI may delete a
Registrant's domain name if this Registration Agreement, or subsequent
modification(s) thereto, contains false or misleading information, or
conceals or omits any information NSI would likely consider material
to its decision to approve this Registration Agreement. 

M.      Right of Refusal. NSI, in its sole discretion, reserves the
right to refuse to approve the Registration Agreement for any
Registrant. Registrant agrees that the submission of this Registration
Agreement does not obligate NSI to accept this Registration Agreement.
Registrant agrees that NSI shall not be liable for loss or damages
that may result from NSI's refusal to accept this Registration
Agreement. 

N.      Severability. Registrant agrees that the terms of this
Registration Agreement are severable. If any term or provision is
declared invalid, it shall not affect the remaining terms or
provisions which shall continue to be binding. 

O.      Entirety. Registrant agrees that this Registration Agreement
and the Dispute Policy is the complete and exclusive agreement between
Registrant and NSI regarding the registration of Registrant's domain
name. This Registration Agreement and the Dispute Policy supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, whether established by custom,
practice, policy, or precedent. 

P.      Governing Law. Registrant agrees that this Registration
Agreement shall be governed in all respects by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United
States of America. By submitting this Registration Agreement,
Registrant consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
Alexandria Division. If there is no jurisdiction in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria
Division, then jurisdiction shall be in the Circuit Court of Fairfax
County, Fairfax, Virginia. 

Q.      This is Domain Name Registration Agreement Version
Number 4.0. This Registration Agreement is only for registrations
under top-level domains: COM, ORG, NET, and EDU. By completing
and submitting this Registration Agreement for consideration and
acceptance by NSI, the Registrant agrees that he/she has read and
agrees to be bound by A through P above.
