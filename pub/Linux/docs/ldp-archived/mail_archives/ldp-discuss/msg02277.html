&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; Note that a gzipped tar file is also created which is a package
&gt; &gt; of all the single-file HTML docs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The question is &quot;should the files themselves and/or the tar
&gt; &gt; packages be mirrored....&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; With data compression used on most modems, tar doesn't save much
&gt; bandwidth anymore.  Since disk space is cheap, the major cost would be
&gt; the bandwidth costs for updating the mirror sites.  But people who
&gt; download HOWTOs from their local mirror site (instead of from Metalab)
&gt; would conserve bandwidth.  So I think it's a good idea.  Since
&gt; packages of all the HOWTOs come with various distributions of Linux I
&gt; think we should supply individual HOWTOs for downloading from the
&gt; mirror sites.  For those who don't know, we now don't supply any
&gt; HOWTOs for downloading from the mirror sites.  If we do this we would
&gt; be supplying single-file HTMLs from the mirrors.

Sure we do. Currently the tar package for the HTML HOWTOs,
(the multi-file HOWTOs) are available on the mirror sites and
do not require being pulled from our host machine.


&gt; Should they be tarred?  If not, then they could be used for on-line
&gt; browsing and anyone who wanted a copy would use the browser to save
&gt; it.

The tar packages are nice for those that want to grab
the entire set quickly/easily (for offline browsing or
otherwise).

&gt; But this wastes bandwidth for those that only read a small part
&gt; of one.  One solution is to have 2 ways to read on-line: HTML-split
&gt; (most efficient --what we do now) and HTML-single (can easily save it
&gt; with the browser).  To encourage efficiency, I would only say &quot;read
&gt; HOWTOs online&quot; for the split ones.
&gt;
&gt; Another issue is that of small HOWTOs.  There isn't much point in
&gt; splitting a 10k HOWTO up into 10@ 1k chunks.  If someone reads even
&gt; half of this small split-HOWTO they probably use more bandwidth in
&gt; overhead than they save by transferring less text-data.  For this case
&gt; they are better off reading the single-HOWTO.  But how to easily
&gt; implement this?

Not easy. The split is based on document structure (when
processed). I suppose we could do something like -

   if the file size of the single-file HTML variant is less
   then X bytes, replace the multi-file HOWTO of the same name.

I'm more inclined to remain consistent with the presentation,
however - even if that means 1K chunks (just my opinion).

&gt; One could also argue in favor of plain text which is what I use but
&gt; with possible future interlinking between HOWTOs, I would vote for
&gt; HTML.
&gt;
&gt; Since we have been giving people only the split html-howtos for
&gt; downloading, I guess it's OK to keep doing this.  But now we give them
&gt; a choice.  Most people who understand this option should take the
&gt; single html-HOWTOs since they are easier to search when using a
&gt; browser.  Also there are a lot fewer files to find with ls (or
&gt; locate).  Thus the distribution of the split ones should be of little
&gt; interest.  Except that the split ones are used for on-line reading to
&gt; conserve bandwidth and are sent to all mirror sites for this purpose.

Ok, so based on those comments, I believe that the tar package(s)
for both the split AND single-file HOWTOs should be made available
from the mirrors.

What about the single-file files themselves (not just the tar file)?
I think they should probably remain accessible only off the host
machine (and not mirrored).

&gt; From the way it looks now in docs.html#howto most people might just
&gt; choose &quot;HTML&quot; and not understand what is meant by &quot;single-file&quot;.  Thus
&gt; I think that the split ones need to be called &quot;HTML - split&quot; with the
&gt; &quot;single-file&quot; ones coming first.  There are probably a few sites that
&gt; have added useful material to the indexes that need the split ones
&gt; (although they could generate them from the .sgml files).  Eventually,
&gt; &quot;HTML - single file&quot; could be changed to just HTML since they would be
&gt; used much more than the split ones.

Yes, but the split ones are still the primary browseable
docs, right? That's what you said earlier in your msg (if
I read it correctly).

So, in summary (correct this if I misunderstood) :

  * mirror the split HOWTOs for (primary) browsing         -- DONE
  * mirror the tar files containing the split HOWTOs       -- DONE
  * keep the single-file HOWTOs on the host only           -- DONE
  * mirror the tar files containing the single-file HOWTOs -- OPEN
