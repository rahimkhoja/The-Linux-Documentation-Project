Everyone,

Laurie Petrycki of Pearson Technology Group (New Riders/MTP, Cisco Press,
Addison-Wesley Professional, Prentice-Hall Professional Technical Group,
Que, and Sams) has provided us with a new draft of the OPL. This draft
retains all of the intents of the original license, but the language itself
has been reworked by the PTG lawyers. (This is a &quot;good thing.&quot;) I am
attaching it below for your comment.

As for the content of the license itself, we have seen several good
suggestions in the past few weeks. One is that the &quot;publisher's name on the
cover&quot; option does not apply to (what now constitutes) the majority of works
published under the OPL. I would like to recommend that this clause be moved
down to become a third option.

We have also read much about license proliferation and the confusion a
person might feel when they see, on Freshmeat or somewhere else, a license
listed as &quot;OPL.&quot; Is that with no clauses? One or both clauses? rms is right
in saying that we need different kinds of licenses for different kinds of
works... but I'm not sure if options are the way to achieve different
licenses. Therefore, I will make the following suggestion:

We should create three licenses which provide varying levels of freedom /
protection to the authors and publishers of documents.

(1) The totally and completely free license Richard is finishing.
(2) The OPL as below without the &quot;publisher's name&quot; clause but including the
&quot;no substantial modification&quot; clause (not as an option, but as part of the
license itself).
(3) The OPL as below with all clauses (publisher's name, no substantial
modification, no commercial book form) (again, not as options, but as part
of the license itself).

I will further recommend that we give these licenses distinguishing, yet
similar, titles, such as Free Publication License (FPL), Verbatim
Publication License (VPL), and Open Publication License (OPL). A scheme like
this should provide some *much* needed consistency and clarity to the work
we are all trying to help along. Of course, a naming scheme like the one
above would require some flexibility. (Richard: are you willing to be
flexible on the name of your license to create a consistency like that
suggested above?)

What does everyone think?

David
