Don,

Thanks for the response!

I've added a few comments below.

One thing I did not make clear in the original post was that I was
thinking about a situation where the document has no license (at all)
and we can't locate the author.  

Another thing that I want to reiterate is that IANAL!!

I wonder if any lawyers lurk on this list?

&gt; &gt; I'm just thinking (or not thinking ;-) ) out loud -- if an author cannot
&gt; &gt; be located after some reasonable efforts, and if his document is
&gt; &gt; unlicensed, could we modify his document but maintain his name as the
&gt; &gt; original author along with a sort of disclaimer statement explaining
&gt; &gt; that we tried the following means of locating &lt;author&gt; but could not
&gt; &gt; contact him, we would still like to find him, so if you know him or can
&gt; &gt; provide any hints we would appreciate it.  In the meantime, we have
&gt; &gt; taken the liberty of updating his document, the current maintainer is
&gt; &gt; _______.  I would then list everything we know about the author and what
&gt; &gt; steps we tried to locate him.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not include in the licence a clause stating that, failing
&gt; &quot;reasonable means&quot; of contact, the author agrees to allow LDP to
&gt; authorise such changes as it (LDP) sees fit, in light of new advances in
&gt; that particular area?

Sounds like a good idea (from now on)!  I don't know if someone from the
LDP will pursue this.  (I consider myself to be a lurker.)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If we are polite about this, hopefully we would not offend the author if
&gt; &gt; he does turn up, and our good faith effort to find the original author
&gt; &gt; would seem to provide some sort of defense (or mitigating circumstance)
&gt; &gt; in a possible legal dispute.
&gt; 
&gt; Also include a passage indemnifying LDP from any action if the author
&gt; fails to respond to correspondence sent to his/ her address, as supplied
&gt; with the original document?

Another good idea, assuming that such a passage is legal and can be
enforced.  I've seen other good ideas to address this point (like
maintaining an author email registry, and regularly (once a month)
emailing them to confirm their address still works).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Even if the author has died and his heirs show up wishing to assert
&gt; &gt; their rights to his copyright (because it's good for 70 years after his
&gt; &gt; death), I think our good faith efforts to find the author and the
&gt; &gt; &quot;presumed intent&quot; of the author in making the document available to the
&gt; &gt; LDP or freely downloadable from some web source would give us a defense
&gt; &gt; against any sort of claim of &quot;malice aforethought&quot; (if that helps us
&gt; &gt; any).
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly my point - besides, how can his heirs claim rights on the
&gt; original copyright? Doesn't an articcle have to be original (i.e. your
&gt; own work) to be copyrighted in the first place? Do I have any rights to
&gt; the letters my Grandfather sent to his girlfriend from the trenches in
&gt; 1914? No! They were sent to her, therefore they are her property. The
&gt; docs on the LDP site, (by the very act of submission there), are
&gt; &quot;addressed&quot; to interested parties, therefore, they should belong to the
&gt; intended recipients. (The internet community at large).

Well (IANAL), but a copyright is valid until 70 years after the authors
death -- someone presumably owns the copyright, and I assumed it was his
heirs.   Maybe in this case his girlfriend's heirs have a claim to the
copyright?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suspect a lawyer would point out we could still be sued, and there are
&gt; &gt; lawyers that would take such a case, perhaps even on a contingency
&gt; &gt; basis.  We can offer the remedy of immediately withdrawing the revised
&gt; &gt; document from distribution via our web site (and afterwards create a new
&gt; &gt; document to replace it, not based on the original).  I don't think too
&gt; &gt; many people would force us into that position, or seek to obtain
&gt; &gt; monetary damages, especially if we are not making money.
&gt; 
&gt; Very few lawyers will take on a case against a non-profit organisation
&gt; unless they are paid up front first!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Which leads me to this question:  Is the LDP any sort of legal entity
&gt; &gt; (non-profit corporation)?  If not, should we consider incorporating to
&gt; &gt; shield &quot;members&quot; from personal liability in a potential situation like
&gt; &gt; this?
&gt; 
&gt; This would be a good idea!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hope this leads to productive discussion,
&gt;
