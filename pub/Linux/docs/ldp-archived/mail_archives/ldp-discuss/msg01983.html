Take The Loss Now And Smile- How Repeat Customers 
Can Be Your Meal-Ticket For Life! Part I


Hi again.  This week I'm going to go over a concept 
in which, as you read it, you're probably going to 
say, &quot;Has Ken gone off his rocker.&quot;

No I haven't and as you read you will see why this 
concept will help you get droves of customers.

Acquiring customers at a break even or slight loss 
and making substantial profits on the back end.

This is one of the most overlooked and under 
utilized methods of customer growth and generation 
you have available.

But it can't work for you until you first recognize 
a very important fact.

If your business is one that has a high probability 
of customers coming back over and over again to 
repurchase frequently from you, you must do 
everything within your power to get customers into 
the buying stream as quickly and easily as you 
possibly can.

When I consult with companies, I have them do an 
exercise called the Lifetime Value of a customer.

This is a very important exercise for you to go 
through, because until and unless you first 
identify and understand exactly how much combined 
profit a customer means to your business for the 
life of that relationship, you can't begin to know 
how much time, effort, and most importantly, 
expense you can afford to invest to acquire that 
customer in the first place.

Many businesses, and I suspect yours is one of 
them, make a substantial amount of their profit 
from customers who keep repurchasing from you over 
and over again, over the years and even over 
decades.

All of those repurchases put a substantial amount 
of increased profit in your bank account, and 
untimately into your pocket.

Very little of that profit would be there if you 
didn't bring those customers into your business in 
the first place.

So let's think about, not the beginning of the 
relationship, but the continuation and recurring 
purchases that result from bringing customers into 
your business.

I'd like to ask you this question.

&quot;How much would it be worth if you could bring in 
an extra 100, or 1000 customers this month and 
every month and you didn't make a single solitary 
dime on the initial transaction, but you will have 
enormous profits on all the repeat transactions you 
did with them over the future?&quot;

So the concept is this.

I want to give you a method you could use to 
acquire as many new customers as you possibly can 
on a break even or even a small loss, so long as 
your business is one that has a considerable high 
frequency of repurchases you can depend on getting, 
from that customer.

What I want to share with you now are some actual 
examples and stories of how a few interesting 
companies increased their customer or profits, 
merely by shifting their focus away from trying to 
make a huge profit on the acquisition of a new 
customer.

Instead they were content to make their real profit 
on all the repeat purchases that resulted from 
those new customers.

I bet you can think of many more than the ones I'm 
going to go over this week.

The classic example that comes to everyones mind is 
the record clubs, the tape clubs, and now the music 
CD clubs.

Why would you imagine a big, well known company 
like the Columbia Club, or the Book of the Month 
Club, would be willing to send you six or ten or 
twelve tapes, books, or CD's, for six cents or one 
dollar?

Do you think it's because they lose money long term 
on you, or do you think it's because they recognize 
that for every 20, or 2000 people coming in, that a 
large number will keep buying over and over again 
in the future at the full rate?

They want to do everything possible to make it easy 
and attractive to get you started buying and using 
their service in the first place.

They do tens of millions of dollars a year from the 
people that come in from that break-even 
proposition.

In next week's tip, I'm going to go over a few 
examples of some of my consulting clients and how I 
helped them increase their customer base many times 
over, just from breaking even on the initial sale.

Till then, keep healthy.
