&gt; A very balanced reply, Greg.

Thanks.  I realize that I'm strong worded, but that's the only way to get my
point across, and the best way to do that &lt;emphasis&gt;I&lt;/emphasis&gt; think is
best for the LDP.  There are places where I agree, and others where I don't.
If we always agreed, then there wouldn't be any point, would there?

&gt; Apropos vi, I don't like it because it's a mode editor. If 
&gt; you forget which mode
&gt; you're in, or don't look, you end up typing a nonsense 
&gt; command. I really hate
&gt; &quot;powerful&quot; editors, Windows or Linux. Part of the reason is I 
&gt; have MS, and
&gt; inadvertently strike keys I don't mean to. I hate it when the 
&gt; editor goes off and
&gt; does something weird.

I tend to agree, but there are some people who like things that way.  I
don't really have a problem with that sort of thing, because I use DocBook
for everything.

&gt; As for emacs, the X-Windows version is far better than the 
&gt; terminal version. Its
&gt; help really, really sucks.

Help does suck, but the tutorial is enough to get you started using it, and
I've got some quick reference cards that I got from TechRepublic that are
good for newbies.  Using the X version, I haven't needed help, I find things
the same way that I would under any other editor, I go through the menus.
Emacs is at least smart enough to have dynamic menu names.

&gt; Only if you know the name can you 
&gt; look it up. But then
&gt; you don't need to. We really need some graphics of emacs 
&gt; working. I did the WP
&gt; graphics almost without effort. That's a sign that something 
&gt; is way easier to
&gt; use.

Hmm...  I guess I can get some graphics of Emacs in action.  We need to
create a .emacs file to distribute to people who want to use Emacs.  I've
got the one from Frederick (KDE guru, I think), but it's only the best one,
it's missing some things that I want.  I destroyed my Linux at home so I'm
hesitant to work on that too much from here.

&gt; I also figured out the basic structure of DocBook just 
&gt; using WP without any
&gt; help from the HOWTO-HOWTO. That's a sign it needs major 
&gt; modification. It should
&gt; be a one-stop place for authors to get everything. One thing 
&gt; it shouldn't do,
&gt; which it does now, is confuse authors by talking about stuff 
&gt; the LDP is leaving
&gt; behind.

I'd like to see any mention of Linuxdoc left out, but some people don't seem
to think that's a good idea.  I'd like to see us &quot;legacy&quot; that system, and
keep it around just for people who already know it.  This will become MUCH
easier once the LDP has a machine that we can give accounts on, so that
people don't have/want to figure out the tools can still do work.  All
that's needed on an authors machine (IMO) is an editor, a validating parser,
and a copy of the DTD.  Anything else is just extras.  Actually, I never
look at any of the output from my documents, I just work directly on the
DocBook.  If somebody doesn't like how it looks, they can ask, and maybe
we'll get the dsl changed.  This may sound strange, but I don't care what my
document looks like, if you don't like how it looks, tell the people who
write the stylesheets.  I'm NEVER going to markup based on appearance.  

&gt; BTW, this discussion is healthy and long overdue. When I 
&gt; first got on this forum,
&gt; it was obvious that all I could do is irritate people of long-standing
&gt; membership. I was pretty sure I was right, but I had nothing 
&gt; to demonstrate it.
&gt; Now I've taken Mark's howto and rewritten it with a tool that 
&gt; he wrote off. It
&gt; has graphics where it had none before. You may not agree with 
&gt; me, but you can't
&gt; shrug off an SGML fait accompli.

I agree that we should have been doing this for a while, but I haven't had
the time or motivation to work on the HOWTO-HOWTO (I've sent a few changes
to Mark, but nothing on this scale).  I'm not entirely sure that I like your
version better, but your intentions are good, and your ideas are good.
Actually, I'm really glad that we have some &quot;new blood&quot; that's not afraid to
ruffle some feathers, and I'm glad to see more of some of the &quot;old hats&quot;
here as well.  Definately a good time for the LDP.  Yay us!  8^)
	Greg
