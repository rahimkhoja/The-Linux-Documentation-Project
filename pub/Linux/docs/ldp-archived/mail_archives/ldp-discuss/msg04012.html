Gregory!

&gt; &gt; You require people to accept licences of varying degrees. Maybe
&gt; &gt; requiring people to state that feedback should at least be
&gt; &gt; CC'ed to the
&gt; &gt; LDP would be too difficult...or maybe I'm being sarcastic...I meant
&gt; &gt; REALISTIC.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't follow you here.  What's wrong with the licensing policy?  Why
&gt; should feedback on a document HAVE to go to the mailing list?  Sending it to
&gt; the author has yielded good results for me.

I said the LDP not the mailing list. However one defines the LDP. If the
feedback gets copied to the LDP then everyone might have a chance to fix
it. 

&gt; Yeah, but it certainly sounds like you're complaining that we're getting NO
&gt; publicity, and not complaining about the bad publicity that we're getting.

Possibly because I might be pointing that out.

&gt; It's got nothing to do with permission.  Debian was kind enough to host
&gt; these mailing lists for us, since we did not have the resources to host them
&gt; ourselves.  Now that we have those resources available, we're in the
&gt; processor transferring to lists to a new server.

That was a political statement on my part; personally I think that
Debian is a good distribution but sometimes the maintainers - to use an
idiom - cut their noses to spite their face with their policies.

&gt; different issues that arise from people emailing webmaster.  The concept for
&gt; the LDP is the same.  People will not necessarily join the mailing list if
&gt; they have suggestions or comments, they may simply wish to send them off.

It's too difficult to select from a list of email addresses where they
should be sent. I forgot that people are inherently lazy [1].

&gt; &gt; I will decline to propose new ideas on the &quot;closed
&gt; &gt; list&quot;....this, IN MY
&gt; &gt; OPINION, is quite silly. There should be one list and one list only.
&gt; &gt; Let's not go multi-personality....

That was supposed to read:

&quot;I see no reason in maintaining an open to everyone who is anyone list.
It creates a good deal of confusion as to which list IS the LDP
discussion list.&quot;

&gt; The mailing list runs the LDP.  The people who make policy decisions are the
&gt; people who show up here and contribute.

I've noticed. Group consensus by the elite as I keep on saying...

&gt; We don't care if they buy it, so long as it's available to them.  I'd like
&gt; to see us get better name recognition so that people know where the
&gt; documents can be found.  If people choose not to contribute back to the LDP,
&gt; that's their decision, we cannot force them to contribute.

I was actually pointing out that good documentation has universal worth.

&gt; Your arguments are NOT clear, and you made no mention of that being an
&gt; example (that I could see, at least) in your mail.  Have you read the LAG?

Yes, I have. I have a tendency to argue in hyperbole (it does throw
people considerably I know but it makes for interesting dinner talk).

&gt; Maybe you aren't making yourself clear...

My point is that DTD's and other schema (for want of a better word) help
create valid documents. The XML specification is quite clear on this -
whilst a document may be well-formed it is not necessarily valid. And
because we can't expect XML parsers to be telepathic they must be
provided with a DTD.

&gt; The LAG has some guidelines for this, and there are a couple of sample
&gt; templates, and TONS of sample HOWTOs to go from.  What EXACTLY are you
&gt; asking for?

Nothing in particular. I am vaguely contributing ideas and arguments to
the style guide :-)

&gt; Yeah, so what?  We have stylesheets that are designed to do a good job
&gt; creating output from the documents that we receive.  The LAG outlines the
&gt; things that you should do before you decide to submit your document to us.

Heh!

The argument you answered &quot;so what&quot; to is lost in the ether. It made
sense at the time and in the context I made it. I'm afraid, in this
e-mail, it's lost context to an extent where it doesn't make sense.

&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.1//EN&quot;&gt;
&gt; &lt;book&gt;
&gt; &lt;title&gt;Using &quot;ls&quot;&lt;/title&gt;
&gt; &lt;chapter&gt;
&gt; &lt;para&gt;
&gt; Unless you are a &lt;emphasis&gt;black man&lt;/emphasis&gt; or &lt;emphasis&gt;jewish
&gt; woman&lt;/emphasis&gt; you will already understand what the &quot;ls&quot; 
&gt; command does.
&gt; &lt;/para&gt;
&gt; &lt;/chapter&gt;
&gt; &lt;/book&gt;

&gt; First, be sure to spell-check your document. Most utilities that you would
&gt; use to write SGML have plug-ins to perform a spell check. If not, there's
&gt; always the aspell program.

There's no spelling errors in that particular snippet of the document.
There would be no less spelling errors in the whole document.

&gt; Second, get someone to review your documentation for comments and factual
&gt; correctness.

What if this is the &quot;Linux for the [name a right wing white nationalist
group]&quot;? I assume that they would validate various statements that
others would find repungant.

&gt; The documentation that is published by the LDP needs to be as
&gt; factually correct as possible, as there
&gt; are millions of Linux users that may be reading it. If you're part of a
&gt; larger mailing list talking about the subject, ask others from the list to
&gt; help you out.

I was essentially saying to the people who seem to want to throw out
these sections that they should be kept in [2].
 
&gt; This WILL be fixed, as soon as it can be.  As of right now, administrative
&gt; control for these lists is out of our hands.  Once it IS within our power,
&gt; it will be fixed.  Patience is a virtue.

Or an excuse to live with things that never happen.

Personally I'm inclined to say &quot;intellectually stupid&quot;, but that's
unfair; they probably only look and act stupid.
&lt;/asbestos on&gt;

&lt;self reminder&gt;
People don't understand hyperbole - they are unable to determine what is
true and what is not, or even work out that you're using an exagerrated
example.

As the miller told his tale
That a face that at first was ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale....
