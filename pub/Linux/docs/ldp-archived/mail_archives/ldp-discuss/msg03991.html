&gt; &gt; I'd like to hear more of why this appears to be a problem, and I'd
&gt; &gt; like to help fix it (if I can).
&gt;
&gt; You require people to accept licences of varying degrees. Maybe
&gt; requiring people to state that feedback should at least be CC'ed to the
&gt; LDP would be too difficult...or maybe I'm being sarcastic...I meant
&gt; REALISTIC.

The template does cover that. Although again, *portions* are
not enforced as strictly as perhaps you'd like to see (given
your comments).

&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That will be corrected soon. Once debian turns the existing
&gt; &gt; mailing lists over to us, we will roll all into a closed list
&gt; &gt; format (you must subscribe to post).
&gt;
&gt; I will believe that when I see it. To be perfectly honest, I *always*
&gt; look at those who allow SPAM on mailing lists with suspicion and I only
&gt; subscribe to a mailing list that allows spam unless I'm really
&gt; interested. I am, believe me, interested in ensuring that the LDP
&gt; continues its work and contributes to the community. I'm not interested
&gt; in the spam and if you look at my history I've stated so...with voice
&gt; and opinion.
&gt;
&gt; Why do you need debian's permission to turn the lists over to you? Have
&gt; I read things wrong - is this the Debin Documentation Project?

The lists were originally setup/hosted with Debian.


&gt; &gt; One list will remain &quot;open&quot; for feedback from the web-site,
&gt; &gt; and for the proposal of ideas for new content pieces, etc
&gt;
&gt; Feedback about the web site goes to webmaster. New ideas and such...if
&gt; they're so interted they will join. People who are serious Linux users
&gt; will join mailing lists. Maybe you haven't experienced this and I have.
&gt;
&gt; I will decline to propose new ideas on the &quot;closed list&quot;....this, IN MY
&gt; OPINION, is quite silly. There should be one list and one list only.
&gt; Let's not go multi-personality....

It's not necessarily feedback just on the web site, it might
be about the content that is available. Should one join a
mailing list to just provide a quick comment? Or to simply
say, &quot;I'd like to start a new HOWTO...&quot;? Maybe they should.
I think I'd would tend to join after I received confirmation
on the proposed HOWTO (as an example).


&gt; &gt; Yes, and when it was proposed that the LDP define some sort of
&gt; &gt; order, hierarchy or central contacts (such as a &quot;core team&quot;) it
&gt; &gt; was meant with much resistence. Like you state - it's a fine line.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps it was in the way it was proposed, I don't know for sure.
&gt;
&gt; So what we have is an unwritten, unheard of elite group who run the LDP.
&gt; Putting it bluntly - and you would know I don't spare feelings or words
&gt; - no wonder people distrust the LDP. If you are not capable of forming a
&gt; core group then it is natural, even right, that people may be suspicious
&gt; of your motives.

Distrust? Suspicious? Of trying to provide a service back to the linux
community? I feel like I'm part of some conspiracy here. Are we doing
anything right?! :-}

There are a list of volunteers that perform specific functions;
that list is published on the site. Sounds like you want to go
beyond that, so please propose something.


&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that we need to pull ourselves together and bring
ourselves to
&gt; &gt; &gt; a more consistent touch and feel to the LDP; someone or a group of
us
&gt; &gt; &gt; should attempt to convince the vendors not to include the &quot;HOWTOs&quot;
but
&gt; &gt; &gt; to include the &quot;HOWTOs by the [author] and the LDP&quot;...a small change
but
&gt; &gt; &gt; we're facing a marketing exercise. At some stage many of the HOWTOs
have
&gt; &gt; &gt; been submitted to the LDP and we should make sure this is known.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is gained by all this, beyond some name recognition? Who
benefits,
&gt; &gt; the LDP or the consumer?
&gt;
&gt; The LDP and the consumer. Name recognition is important. Most of the
&gt; HOWTOS and even man pages included with many distros are based on the
&gt; LDP's works or works under its auspices. We all gain if we gain more
&gt; recognition....just because we are open source and open content does not
&gt; mean we can be null marketing. We MUST market ourselves...people WILL
&gt; buy good documentation!

Ok, that sounds fine. Although I'm not taking the word &quot;buy&quot; literally.


&gt; &gt; There is no need to create one. This is generated from the
&gt; &gt; structured content that is provided to us. *No one* needs to create
&gt; &gt; a TOC. If you see a document within the LDP that *does not* contain
&gt; &gt; a TOC, please let me know - it is an error.
&gt;
&gt; I was using an example. I was saying for example, you should give us a
&gt; title for your work. Take yourself out of the specifics of my example
&gt; and rethink...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Style (look) is controlled via the DSSSL. We can tweak that in
whatever
&gt; &gt; way makes sense. Jorge Godoy has been looking into CSS for an
&gt; &gt; additional layer/way to provide a different look to the LDP documents.
&gt; &gt; Again, this places no burden whatsoever on the author...they still
&gt; &gt; provide SGML (or XML).
&gt;
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;
&gt; DSSL and XSL can't translate CDATA without a DTD. There is no DTD for
&gt; this e-mail. If I don't provide my name, email address and contact
&gt; details how can a DSSL or XSL translation sheet render these fields?
&gt; Assuming the LDP decides that it is a good thing to include an abstract
&gt; on the content page, how does the DSSL or XSL transaltion sheets render
&gt; these fields without the CDATA for the abstract?
&gt;
&gt; You are missing my point entirely.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not talking about style as in physical layout (html, tex, pdf, .doc
&gt; or wotever), I'm talking about the way a document is expressed an
&gt; formed.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Please work with us on this. If anyone has ideas on what might
&gt; &gt; constitute a nice style for the LDP docs, please provide
&gt; &gt; input. The existing docbook SGML tranformations that were done
&gt; &gt; can give you an idea of what we currently use for &quot;style&quot; (thru
&gt; &gt; DSSL). Here are some examples:  Bootdisk-HOWTO, DSL-HOWTO,
&gt; &gt; Mail-User-HOWTO, Cable-Modem, Program-Library-HOWTO ...to name a few.
&gt;
&gt; Again, you have totally missed my point. I could write you an XSL sheet
&gt; for DB 4.1 or 3.1 which rendered DocBook 3.1 in the most inappropriate
&gt; manner possible.

Ok, that wasn't clear from the initial msg. I delved into the
technical aspect of the presentation, based on how you worded
your initial msg (esp w/the toc). I think I know where you are
headed with this.


&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt; SGML helps us to enforce a level of structure, our templates help
&gt; &gt; to provide some *guidance* in the area of how the structure should
&gt; &gt; be applied. So I believe it comes down to writing style, which I am
&gt; &gt; (personally) opposed to dictating any sort of rules for.
&gt;
&gt; So
&gt;
&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.1//EN&quot;&gt;
&gt; &lt;book&gt;
&gt; &lt;title&gt;Using &quot;ls&quot;&lt;/title&gt;
&gt; &lt;chapter&gt;
&gt; &lt;para&gt;
&gt; Unless you are a &lt;emphasis&gt;black man&lt;/emphasis&gt; or &lt;emphasis&gt;jewish
&gt; woman&lt;/emphasis&gt; you will already understand what the &quot;ls&quot; command does.
&gt; &lt;/para&gt;
&gt; &lt;/chapter&gt;
&gt; &lt;/book&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Is a valid LDP document. It does conform to DocBook V4.1. I would, of
&gt; course fill it out with more racist and sexist comments but ensure its
&gt; technical correctness...

To back up a bit:

1. There is a style guide, it's still being worked on and shaped.

2. Same with the template, which I believe covers some aspects of
   what you want you have brought up (the flow of the document,
   the required structural elements, etc.)

   Earlier I said &quot;There are some basic structured elements that
   need to be included.&quot;. That includes authors name, date, version,
   abstract, reference or inclusion of a license, etc.

4. As for technical accuracy, review of content, etc. we need *people*
   to do that function.

   How can we hope to catch something like your examples? No
   level of s/w could handle that; we need people. We would
   need some sort of review board to examine each and every
   submittal and document we have.


&gt; &gt; Understood. We all feel this way, and the problem will be corrected,
&gt; &gt; as I stated earlier.
&gt;
&gt; And Santa Claus can deliver all his presents in one evening...

I'm sorry you feel that way. I have faith this will (finally) get done.
