&gt; &gt; Sometimes there needs to be a trouble maker.  I agree completely with
&gt; &gt; Jim's sentiment as well as Kendall's.  This &quot;core team&quot; business is
&gt; &gt; silly.  Marketing the LDP is silly.
&gt; 
&gt; And ignoring the power of marketing is just as silly.

Sure, but then we have to use the channels we already have,
even now the <A  HREF="news:comp.os.linux.answers">news:comp.os.linux.answers</A> remain empty yet
starting to use it should not cost money. I cannot recall
last time I saw a posting from LDP there.

&gt; We must tell people where they can find good quality and free
&gt; documentation.
&gt; 
&gt; That means concurrencing MacMillan or O'Reilly.

We should get back to waliking before starting to run, I see
little benefit in expending time and effort on new avenues
when old ones are being left behind for no good reason. From
what I have seen the core team has not communicated any plans
to disband <A  HREF="news:comp.os.linux.answers">news:comp.os.linux.answers</A> or has it? Unless it is
kept in use people will forget it, unsubscribe from it etc.

&gt; &gt; Sure, if LDP members are already going to be at a trade show or
&gt; &gt; conference, then fine, let them get the free booth that's available
&gt; &gt; (and for projects like this they always exist) and annoy RH or VA
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry that's not the way I see it.
&gt; 
&gt; We're not going to hand out flyers, but rather talk with people
&gt; wondering why there's a documentation project, why it's free, what we're
&gt; doing, what license we use...

Again I see a lack of focus:to make people aware of the LDP
and start using it as a resource. I believe there are MANY
more ways to achieve this that are cheaper, faster and reach
more people.

&gt; We need to explain what the LDP is about, not give away flyers ; it sure
&gt; can help but a discussion in the real world is better.

And how many do you reach in a conference? Probably not many
unless you are invited as a speaker. Again I feel we should
wait with the conference profiling, especially since we have
to get to work on many other avenues where we are lacking.
Also I believe it is better to present something which is
working well at a conference. Negative impressions from Slashdot
articles are probably not forgotten.

&gt; &gt; or someone to print off some flyers to hand out.  But to turn this
&gt; 
&gt; We try to do whatever possible by ourselves, and use exterior help
&gt; only as the last possibility.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; into something that needs to raise money to support traveling to
&gt; &gt; market is silly.  A good free software project will &quot;sell&quot; itself
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I never ever had the idea of using a single dollar of the LDP
&gt; for this ; it must be kept for serious issue.
&gt; 
&gt; We can use publicity instead!

Yes! On-line websites and news, and on-disk with installations. The
latter has plenty of opportunities for improvement, ref my
suggestions in an previous posting.

&gt; But we'll never add any other banner to the site.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You folks are going off the deep end (and I'm addressing the &quot;core
&gt; &gt; team&quot; here) with issues that just don't matter.  The most important
&gt; &gt; thing that this project needs is *maintainership*, not leadership.
&gt; &gt; Fix the *technical* issues that still exist (submissions, tracking,
&gt; &gt; etc) and forget about all this other crap.
&gt; 
&gt; - Submission : fixed
&gt; Did you try ldp-submit ?
&gt; The ftp will also help that

Is the FTP up yet? I submitted my data to get access but
never heard anything back.

&gt; - Tracking ?????????????
&gt; 
&gt; We've never discussed this. Maybe you mean indexing ?
&gt; 
&gt; What else do you suggest ?

It is not that long ago since last I posted my list of suggestions
for improved visibility and usability so I won't repeat those. Rather
I'd like to add new ones. A quick check on my Redhat 6.0 machine
using
	man -k help
	man -k ldp
	man -k document
	man -k linux
	man -k resource
	man -k info

came up with no pointers to LDP or the documents, even though
they are all installed here. A few stub manpages would work
wonders for those who know the man command but not LDP.

Also many installations come up with a ready made list of
bookmarks etc. Freshmeat is listed, LDP is not. This too
should be a simple and efficent way of promoting LDP.

And when things are running it might be time to run a new
feature at Slashdot and promote a more professional image
of a smoother running LDP.

   Stein Gjoen
