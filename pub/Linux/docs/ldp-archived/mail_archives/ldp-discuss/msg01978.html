&gt; One problem is that the LDP docs that are being well maintained (and

I don't think this is much of an issue.  We get as many CDs pressed as we
think we can give away, not more.  If the LDP is able to have a showing at
more shows, these CDs could be good for several shows, up to say 3 or 6
months.  We know that some of the docs will be obselete, and RedHat at least
says so in their documentation.  We provide the CDs for convience, and make
it clear that more up to date information is available online.  For the
people who are not online, or don't have convient online access, the CD will
be a lifesaver, as the docs will probably be more up to date than the ones
that a distribution distributes.

&gt; problem is that it doesn't fit into the package management schemes of
&gt; the various distributions.  Many recipients would rather install a
&gt; rpm or Debian package.  That way when they get an updated versions it

I think that we should just provide the documents on the CD, not packaged or
anything, just there in a nice directory layout.  Providing packages can
only get us into extra hassle.  If they want to access them from their hard
drive, they can copy them to their HD.

&gt; But since CDs cost so little it may be worthwhile to distribute them.
&gt; Some people may not have any other convenient way of getting LDP docs.
&gt; Perhaps we should sell them at the cost of making the CD.  Then people
&gt; who have better ways of getting the HOWTOs might not take the CD.

As long as we don't just &quot;throw them away&quot; at anybody who walks by, I think
that mostly the people who have use for the CDs with take them.  I don't
think selling them at the cost of making the CD is very feasable, then we'll
have to figure out costs, and collect money, and a bunch of other
administrative headaches.  However, if somebody feels it's a good idea, and
wants to put in the work, I'm certainly not going to stop them.  :-)

P.S.  Sorry for being so argumenative, it's one of those nights.
