&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My large reply crashed here so I'll rewrite it later. In summary
&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel we need more tags for our specific needs. SGML is
&gt; &gt; &gt; scalable and extensible, right?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, what sorts of tags are you looking for?  I haven't 
&gt; found anything that
&gt; &gt; I want that isn't in DocBook yet (well, except PNG 
&gt; support), but I've only
&gt; &gt; got 1 doc that I'm working on that's big.
&gt; &gt;         Greg
&gt; 
&gt; My long time goal of document accessibility and integration
&gt; have made me think we need tags for
&gt; 
&gt; man pages: &lt;manpage section=&quot;1&quot;&gt;du&lt;/manpage&gt;
&gt; that renders to du(1) in plain text and adds hyperlinks to HTML
&gt; pages and adds to the RELATED list in stub man pages. Some
&gt; commands have multiple man pages, such as mount(2) and mount(8)
&gt; so a section number is needed.

Hmm, ok, I'm CC:'ing the LDP-DocBook list here, because I don't know
everything...yet.  

&gt; HOWTO: &lt;howto&gt;Multi Disk HOWTO&lt;/howto&gt;
&gt; that renders to links to that HOWTO in the HTML pages
&gt; and adds to the RELATED list in stub man pages.

Hmm... Now that I think about this, probably the best/only way to accomplish
this one is through the use of some pre-processors.  Basically, before we
run the SGML source through Jade, we run it through a search and replace.
This search and replace goes and finds the text between &lt;howto&gt; and
&lt;/howto&gt;, and matches that with a list of the HOWTOs.  It would probably
only apply for the formats that support hyperlinking.  However, in order to
implement this, we have to have a list that we say &quot;This is the official
list of the names of the HOWTOs&quot;.  If we do that, we have to send it to at
very least these lists (discuss and announce), so that authors can make sure
that we've got the right names for the HOWTOs.  

&gt; In addition I wish the &lt;file&gt; tag rendering was changed to
&gt; file:///pathoffile URL in the HTML document, shown in courier
&gt; or similar font. This too would be handy in stub man pages.

That should be a trivial change for DocBook, maybe somebody can shed some
light on LinuxDoc.  

&gt; Generally I prefer filenames and commands to be rendered in
&gt; courier or a similar non proportional font.
&gt; 
&gt; Rendering of the hyperlinks would be installation dependent,
&gt; so on the LinuxDoc web pages it would refer to sample files
&gt; wheras on a home system it would point to the actual file.
&gt; 
&gt; Likewise hyperlinks to HOWTOs and man pages would be rendered
&gt; as appropriate for the installation, be it with cgi-scripts,
&gt; calls to xman or the like.

Hmm, sounds a little complex.  The changing how things are rendered is easy
with DocBook.  The changing where things point as appropriate to the
installation sounds really difficult.  

&gt; Today the SGML functionality is used just for conversion, we
&gt; have hardly started tapping the true power of SGML and as such
&gt; it is not surprising some are sceptical to this platform.
&gt; Even LaTeX offers in some areas superior conversion features
&gt; if that is all we are after.
&gt; 
&gt; From what I can see we don't even use SGML for searching, is
&gt; this correct?

Yep, because we don't have an SGML aware search engine.  I don't have the
skills to write one, and don't know where to find people who could.

&gt; To start tapping the power of SGML we need to recruit people
&gt; to make these scripts and changes so we authors don't have to
&gt; spend our time on it.
&gt; 
&gt; My NetHelp sample was rendered by hand and it was very tedious.
&gt; If what people say about the superiority of SGML, this should
&gt; be simple for the experts to whip up quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; When I write the next update for submission to LWN I'll add a
&gt; bit about this unless I get a lot of protests. As usual previews
&gt; will come here first.

I've got no complaints.
Later,
	Greg
