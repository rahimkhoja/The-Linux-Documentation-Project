&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; &gt; So, I found the section on ldp.dsl in the HOWTO. This isn't 
&gt; &gt; the format I'm
&gt; &gt; used to (or prefer) but it is getting closer. I have a couple 
&gt; &gt; of questions
&gt; &gt; about it:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) Is there any way to force section 1 to be on a separate 
&gt; &gt; page from the
&gt; &gt; table of contents? That combination makes the first page huge for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, there is.  Unfortunately, I don't know what it is, and I hate the look
&gt; of DSSSL so I haven't dug into it very much.  Perhaps Jorge Godoy or Greg
&gt; Ferguson can tell you how to do that.  I'd prefer it to be that way as well
&gt; as it makes for a nicer document.

Jorge? Greg? :) I can't promise anything other than massive thanks, but
that should count for something :)
 
&gt; &gt; 2) What is the canonical way to include your email in the 
&gt; &gt; information at
&gt; &gt; the top of the index page? I've tried a few variations on 
&gt; &gt; &lt;AuthorBlurb&gt;
&gt; &gt; and &lt;Affiliation&gt; with no success. Since that is what several 
&gt; &gt; LDP authors
&gt; &gt; use (at least in the versions available on the web site), it 
&gt; &gt; looks like
&gt; &gt; the LDP does not yet use DocBook to actually generate their 
&gt; &gt; documents (at
&gt; &gt; least, they don't use DocBook in any way that I've made sense 
&gt; &gt; of.) So- any
&gt; &gt; better suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; The easiest way is to snag it from a well written SGML document, the
&gt; HOWTO-HOWTO would be a good once, since Mark looks to be really getting
&gt; pretty good with DocBook.  Getting the DocBook source will let you look at
&gt; some of the other nice markup that DocBook provides that LinuxDoc does not.

I had looked at a couple others, but didn't have the sense to realize that
(of course) the HOWTO-HOWTO would probably be the best written of the
bunch. That said, while it does have some cool tags (I understand how the
revision history works now, I think) it still doesn't display the email up
top like I'd like to have (and like has always been LDP practice.) Anyone?

&gt; &gt; 3) Why is &lt;Rant&gt; not a DocBook tag? Seriously... I had always assumed
&gt; &gt; (when I heard that the LDP was switching from LinuxDoc to 
&gt; &gt; DocBook) that
&gt; &gt; that went that DocBook had a well developed set of tools to work with,
&gt; &gt; just like LinuxDoc. These kinds of tools are what give CLIs a 
&gt; &gt; bad name- I
&gt; &gt; don't see the advantage to switching to them if no one can 
&gt; &gt; get anything
&gt; &gt; done with them. Of all things, writing docs should be 
&gt; &gt; straightforward and
&gt; &gt; not require technical wizardry. Jeez. &lt;/Rant&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the tools are progressing a lot, they're actually hundreds of times
&gt; better than when I started into this (isn't that comforting?) and I expect
&gt; them to be almost good by the time that September rolls around. 

After I wrote that rant, I read even further back in the list archives. I
hadn't realized it was quite so new. Still... very frustrating.

&gt; I don't
&gt; have the processing tools installed at all on the machines where I write
&gt; documentation, I just write them, and email it off to the publishers. If
&gt; they don't like how it looks, that's their problem, not mine.

Heh. I wish :) I've only written one book, but the editor is a Mac guy, so
you know what that meant for formatting... that's right, Word. Ugh.

&gt; &gt; Anyway, thanks again for your time- please cc: me to answers. I looked
&gt; &gt; into signing up, but the idea of getting 4 cron job messages 
&gt; &gt; every hour is
&gt; &gt; unappealing.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul!  It's broke again.  :-(  Those CRON messages only show up in the
&gt; archiver, and it's because something is wrong with MhonArc on Metalab.  Or
&gt; at least I assume that's it, since almost everybody on the Mailman list
&gt; swears by it as an archiver.  Anyway, sign up for the list, these are the
&gt; kinds of messages we get, and it's pretty low traffic.

Oh, OK. That's cool. &lt;insert snide Duke joke about UNC people here&gt;

Thanks so much for all the help, everyone...
Luis
