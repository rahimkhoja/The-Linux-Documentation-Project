<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Frequently Asked Questions.</A></H2>

<P><EM>Q:</EM> I used to control which tty's <EM>root</EM> could log into using
the file <CODE>/etc/securettys</CODE>, but it doesn't seem to work anymore,
what's going on?
<P><EM>A:</EM> The file <CODE>/etc/securettys</CODE> does absolutely nothing now
that the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> is installed.  The tty's that <EM>root</EM>
can use are now located in the login configuration file
<CODE>/etc/login.defs</CODE>.  The entry in this file may point to another file.
<P>
<P><EM>Q:</EM> I installed the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM>, but now I can't login,
what did I miss?
<P><EM>A:</EM> You probably installed the Shadow programs, but didn't run
<CODE>pwconv</CODE> or you forgot to copy <CODE>/etc/npasswd</CODE> to
<CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/nshadow</CODE> to <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE>.
Also, you may need to copy <CODE>login.defs</CODE> to <CODE>/etc</CODE>.
<P>
<P><EM>Q:</EM> In the section on xlock, it said to change the group ownership
of the <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file to <CODE>shadow</CODE>.  I don't have a
<CODE>shadow</CODE> group, what do I do?
<P><EM>A:</EM> You can add one.  Simply edit the <CODE>/etc/group</CODE> file, and
insert a line for the shadow group.  You need to ensure that the group
number is not used by another group, and you need to insert it before the
<CODE>nogroup</CODE> entry.  Or you can simply suid <CODE>xlock</CODE> to root. 
<P>
<P><EM>Q:</EM> Is there a mailing list for the Linux Shadow Password Suite?
<P><EM>A:</EM> Yes, but it's for the development and beta testing of the
next Shadow Suite for Linux.  You can get added to the list by mailing to: 
<CODE>shadow-list-request@neptune.cin.net</CODE> with a subject of: 
<CODE>subscribe</CODE>.  The list is actually for discussions of the Linux 
<CODE>shadow-YYMMSS</CODE> series of releases.  You should join if you want to 
get involved in further development or if you install the Suite on your
system and want to get information on newer releases.  
<P>
<P><EM>Q:</EM> I installed the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM>, but when I use the
<CODE>userdel</CODE> command, I get "userdel: cannot open shadow group file",
what did I do wrong?
<P><EM>A:</EM> You compiled the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> with the
<CODE>SHADOWGRP</CODE> option enabled, but you don't have an
<CODE>/etc/gshadow</CODE> file.  You need to either edit the <CODE>config.h</CODE>
file and recompile, or create an <CODE>/etc/group</CODE> file.  See the section
on shadow groups.
<P>
<P><EM>Q:</EM> I installed the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> but now I'm getting
encoded passwords back in my <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file, what's wrong?
<P><EM>A:</EM> You either enabled the <CODE>AUTOSHADOW</CODE> option in the Shadow
<CODE>config.h</CODE> file, or your <CODE>libc</CODE> was compiled with the
<CODE>SAHDOW_COMPAT</CODE> option.  You need to determine which is the problem,
and recompile.
