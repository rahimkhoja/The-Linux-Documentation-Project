<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Post-installation</A></H2>

<P>The Oracle Installation Guide describes a very long list of procedures
to be done after the installation process. Some of them are necessary,
some of them probably in your instance you will never need, but most
importantly this document will not repeat them.
<P>Please refer to the Installation Guide for this procedures. Here I
will describe steps that are very helpful for the minimal installation
that I used, and seem enough for the basic database operations.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Editing the oratab file</A>
</H2>

<P>There is one step in particular that is important, so that you may
start and shutdown the database from the command prompt any time, or to
allow the database to be autostarted during boot. Go to the /etc directory 
and edit the file <B>oratab</B>. In the line:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<B>ORTD:/u01/app/oracle/product/9.2.0.1.0:N</B>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>set the last value to Y and it should read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<B>ORTD:/u01/app/oracle/product/9.2.0.1.0:Y</B>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now save the file and go back to your Oracle home directory.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Script for automatic startup on boot</A>
</H2>

<P>It is generally a good idea to automate the database startup at boot
time on your database server. In this case you will need a script,
which can be included in the run-level sets. Here is an example only.
Please, tune it to your own machine and run-levels!
<P>

#!/bin/bash
#
# Run-level Startup script for the Oracle Instance and Listener
#
# chkconfig: 345 91 19
# description: Startup/Shutdown Oracle listener and instance

ORA_HOME="/u01/app/oracle/product/9.2.0.1.0"
ORA_OWNR="oracle"

# if the executables do not exist -- display error

if [ ! -f $ORA_HOME/bin/dbstart -o ! -d $ORA_HOME ]
then
        echo "Oracle startup: cannot start"
        exit 1
fi

# depending on parameter -- startup, shutdown, restart 
# of the instance and listener or usage display

    start)
        # Oracle listener and instance startup
        echo -n "Starting Oracle: "
        su - $ORA_OWNR -c "$ORA_HOME/bin/lsnrctl start"
        su - $ORA_OWNR -c $ORA_HOME/bin/dbstart
        touch /var/lock/subsys/oracle
        echo "OK"
        ;;
    stop)
        # Oracle listener and instance shutdown
        echo -n "Shutdown Oracle: "
        su - $ORA_OWNR -c "$ORA_HOME/bin/lsnrctl stop"
        su - $ORA_OWNR -c $ORA_HOME/bin/dbshut
        rm -f /var/lock/subsys/oracle
        echo "OK"
        ;;
    reload|restart)
        $0 stop
        $0 start

        echo "Usage: $0 start|stop|restart|reload"
        exit 1

<HR>
<P>You can simply copy and paste this file into your system and change it
according to your settings.
<P>Once you copy and edit the file, move it to the /etc/rc.d/init.d 
directory and change it's ownership and the attributes to be the same
as the other files in the directory.
<P>To do that and the following operations, you will need to be logged as
root user.
<P>The fifth line of this code reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<B># chkconfig: 345 91 19</B>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is used by the chkconfig command when setting the scripts in the
run-levels. The value 345 lists the run-levels in which we allow
Oracle to run, so if you want to be able to run an Oracle instances only
in levels 3 and 5, then change this value to 35. The next value (91)
describes the order number in the startup sequence. This means that if
there are 100 startup processes, the Oracle startup will be the 91st
to run. The next number is the shutdown number, meaning that when the
system is shutdown and there are for example 100 processes to be
shutdown, the Oracle process will be 19 in order. These numbers are
used to set the relative position of the Oracle startup and shutdown
processes. They are set here as an example. You can change them, but
keep in mind that Oracle instancse can not be run without some
processes in the system running beforehand.
<P>Now execute the following command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<B>chkconfig -add oracle</B>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will add the corresponding links in the run-level directories as
listed in the beginning of the script.
<P>To test the newly created automation, you have to reboot your system,
but remember that before this automation runs, the kernel
parameters should be set.  In fact you may include the kernel tune
commands in your <B>start)</B> section of the above script.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Testing your installation with SQL*Plus</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have installed a typical database, there should be a user
created called <B>scott</B>.  The password is <B>tiger</B>. 
Just execute the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<B>sqlplus scott/tiger</B>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>which should run the SQL*Plus interpreter and log in as user scott.
You should see the screen like the following:
