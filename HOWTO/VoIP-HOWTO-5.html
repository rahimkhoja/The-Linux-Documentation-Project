<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Requirement</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Hardware requirement</A>
</H2>

<P>To create a little VoIP system you need the following hardware:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>PC 386 or more</LI>
<LI>Sound card, full duplex capable</LI>
<LI>a network card or connection to internet or other kind of interface
to allow communication between 2 PCs</LI>
</OL>
<P>All that has to be present twice to simulate a standard communication.
<P>The tool above are the minimal requirement for a VoIP connection:
next we'll see that we should (and in Internet we must) use more
hardware to do the same in a real situation.
<P>Sound card has be full duplex unless we couldn't hear anything
while speaking!
<P>As additional you can use hardware cards (see next) able to manage
data stream in a compressed format (see Par 4.3).
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Hardware accelerating cards </A>
</H2>

<P>We can use special cards with hardware accelerating capability.
Two of them (and also the only ones directly managed by the Linux
kernel at this moment) are the
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Quicknet PhoneJack</LI>
<LI>Quicknet LineJack</LI>
<LI>VoiceTronix V4PCI</LI>
<LI>VoiceTronix VPB4</LI>
<LI>VoiceTronix VPB8L</LI>
</OL>
<P>Quicknet PhoneJack is a sound card that can use standard algorithms
to compress audio stream like G723.1 (section 4.3) down to 4.1 Kbps
rate. 
<P>It can be connected directly to a phone (POTS port) or a couple
mic-speaker.
<P>It has a ISA or PCI connector bus.
<P>Quicknet LineJack works like PhoneJack with some addition features
(see next).
<P>VoiceTronix V4PCI is a PCI card pretty like Quicknet LineJack
but with 4 phone ports
<P>VoiceTronix VPB4 is a ISA card equivalent to V4PCI.
<P>VoiceTronix VPB8L is a logging card with 8 ports.
<P>For more info see 
<A HREF="http://www.quicknet.net">Quicknet web site</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.voicetronix.com.au">VoiceTronix web site</A><H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Hardware gateway cards</A>
</H2>

<P>Quicknet LineJack and VoiceTronix cards can be connected to a
PSTN line allowing VoIP gateway feature. 
<P>Then you'll need a software to manage it (see after).
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Software requirement</A>
</H2>

<P>We can choose what O.S. to use:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Win9x</LI>
<LI>Linux</LI>
</OL>
<P>Under Win9x we have Microsoft Netmeeting, Internet Phone, DialPad
or others or Internet Switchboard (from 
<A HREF="http://www.quicknet.net">Quicknet web site</A>) for Quicknet cards. 
<P>Warning!!: Latest Quicknet cards using Swithboard (older version
too) NEED to be connected to Internet to get working for managing
Microtelco account (not free of charge), so if you plan to remain
isolated from Internet you need to install 
<A HREF="http://www.openh323.org">OpenH323 software</A>.
<P>For VoiceTronix cards you can find software at 
<A HREF="http://www.voicetronix.com.au">VoiceTronix web site</A><P>Under Linux we have free software 
<A HREF="http://www.gnomemeeting.org">GnomeMeeting</A>, a clone of Microsoft Netmeeting,
while in console mode we use (also free software) applications from
<A HREF="http://www.openh323.org">OpenH323</A> web site: simph323 or ohphone that can also work with Quicknet accelerating
hardware.
<P>Attention: all Openh323 source code has to be compiled in a user
directory (if not it is necessary to change some environment variable).
You are warned that compiling time could be very high and you could
need a lot of RAM to make it in a decent time. 
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Gateway software</A>
</H2>

<P>To manage gateway feature (join TCP/IP VoIP to PSTN lines) you
need some kind of software like this:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.quicknet.net">Internet SwitchBoard</A> (only when connected to Internet) for Windows systems also acting
as a h323 terminal;</LI>
<LI>PSTNGw for Linux and Windows systems you download from 
<A HREF="http://www.openh323.org/code.html">OpenH323</A>.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Gatekeeper software</A>
</H2>

<P>You can choose as gatekeeper:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Opengatekeeper, you can download from 
<A HREF="http://www.opengatekeeper.org">opengatekeeper web site</A> for Linux and Win9x.</LI>
<LI>Openh323 Gatekeeper (GK) from 
<A HREF="http://www.willamowius.de/openh323gk.html">here</A>.</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 Other software</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="Phonepatch"></A> In addition I report some useful software h323 compliant:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Phonepatch, able to solve problems behind a NAT firewall. It
simply allows users (external or internal) calling from a web page
(which is reachable from even external and internal users): when
web application understands the remote host is ready, it calls (h323)
the source telling it all is ok and communication can be established.
Phonepatch is a proprietary software (with also a demo version for
no more than 3 minutes long conversations) you download from 
<A HREF="http://www.equival.com/phonepatch">here</A>.</LI>
