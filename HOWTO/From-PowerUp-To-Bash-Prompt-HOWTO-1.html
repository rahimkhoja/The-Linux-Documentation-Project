<P>I find it frustrating that many things happen inside my Linux machine that I do
not understand. If, like me, you want to really understand your system rather
than just knowing how to use it, this document should be a good place to start.
This kind of background knowledge is also needed if you want to be a top notch
Linux problem solver.
<P>
<P>I assume that you have a working Linux box, and understand some basic things
about Unix and PC hardware. If not, an excellent place to start learning is
Eric S. Raymond's 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO.html">The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO</A>
It is short, very readable and covers all the basics.
<P>
<P>The main thread in this document is how Linux starts itself up. 
But it also tries to be a more comprehensive learning resource.
I have included exercises in each section. If you actually do some of these,
you will learn much more than you could by just reading.
<P>
<P>I hope some readers will undertake the best Linux learning exercise that I
know of, which is building a system from source code. 
Giambattista Vico, an Italian philosopher (1668-1744) said 
``verum ipsum factum'', which means ``understanding arises through making''.
Thanks to Alex (see 
<A HREF="From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO-14.html#acknowledge">Acknowledgements</A>) 
for this quote.
<P>
<P>If you want to ``roll your own'', you should also see Gerard Beekmans' 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux From Scratch HOWTO</A> (LFS).
LFS has detailed instructions on building a complete useable system from
source code. On the LFS website, you will also find a mailing list for people 
building systems this way. 
The instructions that used to be part of this document 
are now in a separate document ``Building a Minimal Linux System from Source Code'', 
and can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/~gok/power2bash/">From PowerUp to Bash Prompt home page</A>.
They explain how to
``toy'' system, purely as a learning exercise. 
<P>
<P>Packages are presented in the order in which they appear in the system
startup process. This means that if you install the packages in this order
you can reboot after each installation, and see the system get a little closer
to giving you a bash prompt each time. There is a reassuring sense of
progress in this.
<P>
<P>I recommend that you first read the main text of each section, skipping the
exercises and references. Then decide how deep an understanding you want to
develop, and how much effort you are prepared to put in. Then start at the 
beginning again, doing the exercises and additional reading as you go.
