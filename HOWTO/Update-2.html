<!--
up-to-date!information resources
-->
<P>When you start out with a Linux installation you will normally get quite a
bit of information along, not just the installation pamphlet but also
substantial online help and information files as well as HOWTO files. This
gives you a good starting point but after a while you will find yourself
interested in knowing more, updating your system and basically staying
informed. For simplicity this kind of information is here divided into
several types, the type you subscribe to, information you search for as
well as a bit on getting more specific help efficiently.
<P>Even if you don't get printed information of some kind with your Linux
packages you will along with any self respecting distribution get a
number of directories with documentation of some kind, ranging from
the tersest <EM>README</EM> files for most software packages to the more
in depth <EM>HOWTOs</EM>, of which this is one.
<P>Have a look in the
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc">document archive</A>
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO">HOWTO archive</A>
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">mini-HOWTO archive</A>
of plain text documents.
<P>The 
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux">kernel source</A>
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <EM>use the source, Luke</EM>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation">documentation directory</A>.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.
<P>The online documentation is excellent for browsing and searching but
don't dismiss the printed version altogether; if you cannot even
get the machine to boot, how are you going to be able to read that
piece of information you need to get the system going again?
