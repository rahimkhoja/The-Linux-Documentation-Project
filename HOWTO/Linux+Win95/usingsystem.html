>Linux can mount, read, and write to Window 95&#8482;'s VFAT partitions serveral ways.
You can use the stock msdos filesystem support that has been included in
all kernels greater than 1.0. However, using commands like:</P

Windows 95&#8482; so you can use those nifty long file names.</P
><P
>Some Linux users still run kernels that are ancient by Linux standards (1.2.xx).
There is a module for this series of
kernels so that you can read files that do not conform to the old 8.3
standard. If this is the situation you are in, FTP to <A

TARGET="_top"
>ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/linux/xmsdos/</A

and pick up a copy of README before doing anything.</P
><P
>Kernels after 1.3.4x have internal VFAT support that you can compile in. These kernels allow
safe read/writes to your VFAT partitions.
