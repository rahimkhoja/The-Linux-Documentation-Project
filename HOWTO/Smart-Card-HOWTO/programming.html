>   This API depends on the card terminal used, but supplies generic functions that allow communication with memory cards and processor cards. This API is a low level interface to the reader. But still used because it complies with the ISO7816 standards and have a simple programming logic resembling assembly. You just send code byes along with the data packets and receive the response.

>   As you could understand from above, the standardization period of smart cards is not finished. The demand on smart cards is growing on the basis of end-user and developer. In my opinion, if you are a developer or in a decision making position, you should carefully analyse all the standards as well as the companies manufacturing smart cards. As a developers point of view, in the near future I think, Java will evaluate itself as the standard because of portability and cross-platform uses in spite of its slowness and fast evolution.
