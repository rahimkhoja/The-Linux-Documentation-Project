<P>This is a guide to setting up your own domain of Linux machines, or
mixed Linux and Windows machines, on an always-up connection with a
static IP and a named domain. It is not really intended for setups
which use dynamic IPs, or which are regularly disconnected from their
provider for long periods of time, though some basic hints for
operating such a setup are available in section 
<A HREF="Domain-4.html#dynamic-ip">Using A Dynamic IP</A>.
<P>
<P>With the increasing availability of permanent connections and static
IPs, it's becoming easier for people and organizations to set up a
real domain, with the associated Internet presence. Proper planning at
the outset can reduce problems later.
<P>
<P>Much of this document describes techniques for implementing
unobtrusive security on the newly exposed network. This deals with
protection from external attack, and from casual internal attack. It
does not claim to provide an extremely secure setup, but is usually
enough to discourage the less determined attacker.
<P>
<P>This document is primarily directed at small organizations which have
an existing network of computers, possibly with a shared dialup line,
which are trying to move to a permanent, relatively high-speed
connection, either to improve data transfer with the outside world, or
to create a WWW or FTP site. The document is also directed at new
organizations which want to skip the early stage and start out with
higher speed networking and services under their own domain name.
<P>
<P>Throughout this document, I will discuss the configuration of a newly
registered domain, <B>example.com</B>. Note that the name
example.com is reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for
use in documentation, and so will never correspond to an actual
domain.
<P>
<P>Much of the information in this document is available in other
places. I have tried to distill the material relevant to the creation
of a new domain. Where detail on a specific subject is lacking, you
may want to consult one of the more comprehensive documents.
<P>
<P>This document will also assume a mixed OS environment. Specifically, I
will assume that some desktop machines are running some version of
Microsoft Windows, while servers and the private network gateway are
running Linux.
