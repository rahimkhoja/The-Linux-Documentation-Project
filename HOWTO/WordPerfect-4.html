<H2><A NAME="s4">4. WordPerfect 6.0 (Caldera)</A></H2>

<P>Caldera sells both a WordPerfect and Motif Bundle ($130 US) 
and the Caldera Internet Office Suite ($219 US).  Both include 
WordPerfect 6.0 for Linux.  
<P>Overall, WP 6.0 has been good to me.  I have generated 20-30 large
documents and numerous small ones, probably 1000+ pages if I printed
them all out.  The only problem that I have is that I use WP Times 
font under Linux and it is not compatible with the WP True Type Times
font under Windows.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Impressions of 6.0</A>
</H2>

<P>The author has been using WordPerfect for Linux on Caldera 
Network Desktop (CND) for the past year.  The system is a 
P6/200, 64M RAM, SCSI, CND 1.0 with RiskyHack patches to 
the Linux 2.0.30 kernel, updated RPM, and many, many RPMS from
Redhat and Caldera's WWW sites.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Installation of 6.0</A>
</H2>

<P>Installation was easy. I just followed the directions provided....  
<P>I did have to add <B>wp</B> to my fvwm menu (I am using FVWM95
on CND 1.0 with lots of patches) and to looking glass's menus.
<P>My platform is a P6/200, 64M RAM, Caldera CND 1.0, RiskyHacks to libc 5.4.4,
kernel 2.0.30 (Joliet and FAT32 patches), dual SCSI, CD-R, etc.
WP uses 74 MB of disk space.
