advice instead of abstract theory, it is necessary to have some minimal
background in television video in order to understand how to get the
best possible video quality under Linux.

>4.1. General principles: deinterlacing, telecine, and framerates</H2
><P
>&#13;Regular television video is <EM
>interlaced</EM
>, meaning
that the odd-numbered scanlines are recorded (and displayed) first,
followed by the even numbered scanlines, then the odd ones again, then
the even ones again, etc. Each individual line is displayed 30 times a
second (or 25, depending on where you live), but because of the
interlacing, the television image as a whole is refreshed 60 times a
second (or 50), with only half of the total lines being refreshed each
time.
</P
><P
>&#13;In general, with interlaced motion pictures, there is no way to
reconstruct any single video frame perfectly without artifacts. This
point is important enough to repeat: <EM
>there is no way to
perfectly reconstruct any single frame!</EM
> The reason is that
the odd-numbered lines are recorded onto the video tape with a timing
skew of one half-frame relative to the even-numbered lines. If the video
picture is still, this timing skew is no problem, but for moving
pictures it causes half the lines to be displaced from the other half.
On a television screen, you can't see this displacement, since TV
screens (except for high-end HDTV monitors) are of such low quality that
the artifacts aren't visible. However, on a computer screen, this
displacement is very visible and causes comb-like artifacts to appear in
the video.  You can see screenshots of interlacing artifacts in the

>4.1.1. How to fix interlacing artifacts</H3
><P
>The process of removing interlacing artifacts is called
<EM
>deinterlacing</EM
>. Unfortunately, all deinterlacing
techniques are imperfect to some extent, and there is no single method
which works best in all situations. It is therefore important to
experiment with all of the different possible deinterlace settings to
see which one works best for a particular disc.

HREF="usage.html#mplayer"
>MPlayer</A
> users can get a list of deinterlacing options
by typing <B
CLASS="command"
>mplayer -pphelp</B
> at the command line.
Find the option that you want to use, and then use the <B
CLASS="command"
>-vf
pp=&#60;option&#62;</B
> syntax to activate the option. For example,
I usually use the <TT
CLASS="varname"
>lb</TT
> option, which is
done with the command: <B
CLASS="command"
>mplayer -vf pp=lb</B
>, followed by
whatever other options you would normally use to play the DVD.

>This section only applies to video in NTSC format (used in North
America, east Asia, and parts of Latin America) -- PAL users (the rest of
the world) can skip ahead.</P
><P
>&#13;The one exception to all of the above discussion about interlacing is in 
the case of telecined video. Briefly put, <EM
>telecine</EM
>
is a special kind of interlacing that is done only to theatrical (i.e.
cinematic) movies and some forms of hand-drawn animated shows. The
special thing about telecine is that it can usually be perfectly undone.
The details are too complicated to explain here, but you can read about
it in <A

</P
><P
>The process of undoing the telecine artifacts is called
<EM
>inverse telecine</EM
>. The good news is that inverse
telecine, done properly, fully restores the original video quality of
the source video with no artifacts whatsoever. The bad news is that
<A
HREF="usage.html#mplayer"
>MPlayer</A
> is the only player program in the world right
now that can perform inverse telecine.</P
><P
>To perform inverse telecine in MPlayer, simply add the
<TT
CLASS="varname"
>-vf ivtc</TT
> option to the MPlayer command. This
option is the right one to use if you are watching a movie you know
originated as a theatrical release, or if you are watching animated
shows. Warning: this option is very CPU intensive. You need at least a 1 GHz 
processor to even think about doing it.</P

>4.1.3. How come Windows users don't have to deal with all this?</H3
><P
>Windows DVD players hide most of the complexity of DVD playback
and fall back to the lowest common demoninator when playing DVDs. The
result is that you get playback quality which is decent in a wide range
of situations but not always the best that can be achieved in any given
situation. For example, no Windows DVD player in the world has an
inverse telecine filter like MPlayer does, so telecined material always
looks dramatically worse in Windows than in MPlayer under Linux.</P
