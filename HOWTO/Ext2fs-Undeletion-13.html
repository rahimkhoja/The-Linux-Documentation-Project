<H2><A NAME="s13">13. Are there any tools to automate this process?</A></H2>

<P>As it happens, there are.  Unfortunately, I believe that they currently
suffer from the same problem as the manual inode modification technique:
indirect blocks are unrecoverable.  However, given the likelihood that this
will shortly no longer be a problem, it's well worth looking these programs
out now.
<P>I have written a tool called <CODE>e2recover</CODE>, which is essentially a Perl
wrapper around <CODE>fsgrab</CODE>.  It makes a reasonable amount of effort to deal
with zeroed indirect blocks, and seems to work fairly well as long as there
was no fragmentation.  It also correctly sets the permissions (and when
possible the ownership) of recovered files, and even makes sure that
recovered files have the correct length.
<P>I originally wrote <CODE>e2recover</CODE> for the forthcoming major update to this
Howto; unfortunately this means that much of the useful documentation for
<CODE>e2recover</CODE> is scheduled for inclusion in that update.  Be that as it
may, it should be useful now; it can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://pobox.com/~aaronc/tech/e2-undel/">my web site</A>, and
soon from Metalab.
<P>Scott D. Heavner is the author of <CODE>lde</CODE>, the Linux Disk Editor.  It can
be used as both a binary disk editor, and as an equivalent to <CODE>debugfs</CODE>
for ext2 and minix file systems, and even for xia file systems (though xia
support is no longer available in 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernels).  It has some
features for assisting undeletion, both by walking the block list for a
file, and by grepping through disk contents.  It also has some fairly useful
documentation on basic file system concepts, as well as a document on how to
use it for undeletion.  Version 2.4 of <CODE>lde</CODE> is available on
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/lde-2.4.tar.gz">Metalab</A>
and mirrors, or on
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/7731/lde.html">the author's web site</A>.
<P>Another possibility is offered by the GNU Midnight Commander, <CODE>mc</CODE>.  This
is a full-screen file management tool, based AFAIK on a certain MS-DOS
program commonly known as `NC'.  <CODE>mc</CODE> supports the mouse on the Linux
console and in an xterm, and provides virtual file systems which allow
tricks like <CODE>cd</CODE>-ing to a tarfile.  Among its virtual file systems is one
for ext2 undeletion.  It all sounds very handy, although I must admit I
don't use the program myself -- I prefer good old-fashioned shell commands.
<P>To use the undeletion feature, you have to configure the program with the
<CODE>-</CODE><CODE>-with-ext2undel</CODE> option; you'll also need the development libraries and
include files that come with the <CODE>e2fsprogs</CODE> package.  The version
provided in 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</A> is
built in this way; the same may apply to packages for other Linux
distributions.  Once the program is built, you can tell it to <CODE>cd
undel:/dev/hda5</CODE>, and get a `directory listing' of deleted files.  Like
many current undeletion tools, it handles zeroed indirect blocks poorly --
it typically just recovers the first 12k of long files.
<P>The current version may be downloaded from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/Midnight/devel/">the Midnight Commander ftp site</A>.
