>      In the early 1980s the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers' Construction 
      Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) in Champaign, Illinois, began 
      to explore the possibilities of using Geographic Information Systems to 
      conduct environmental research, assessments, monitoring and management 
      of lands under the stewardship of the U. S. Department of Defense.  Part 
      of the motivation for this action was new responsibility for the 
      environment encoded into the National Environmental Policy Act of the 
      late 1970s.
    </P

>      Bill Goran of USA/CERL conducted a survey of available GISs, assuming 
      that he could find several systems capable of environmental analysis, 
      from which he could select one or more to recommend for use by CERL and 
      perhaps others in the Department of Defense.  However, he was surprised 
      to find no GIS that satisfied his needs.  What started as a selection 
      process turned into a design exercise for his own GIS development 
      program.
    </P
><P
>      USA/CERL hired several programmers, and began by writing a hybrid 
      raster-vector GIS for the VAX UNIX environment.   This made the team one 
      of the first to seriously develop GIS for UNIX.  Though they still faced 
      challenges with different versions of UNIX, they developed procedures of 
      coding in ANSI standard UNIX, avoiding "tweaking" the code toward any 
      particular vendor-specific flavor of UNIX.

          libraries for repeated GIS-specific acts such as opening raster 
          files that might be compressed (by run-length encoding) or not.

>          The favoring of raster data processing, as scientific analysis was 
          easier to encode with raster (than for vector) data models.

><P
>          The ability to handle raster grids of mixed grid sizes in the same 
          data base.  This was a departure from raster's image processing 
          tradition of requiring identical (and perfectly registered) grid 
          cell arrays in each and every data layer.
        </P

><P
>          The ability to handle raster grids with different areas of 
          coverage.  Again, this was a departure from raster tradition of 
          having all grids be identical in geographic coverage.

>          The separate structure of reclassification files.  Such files 
          merely contained a look-up table noting the previous and new 
          classes.  This is MUCH more compact than replicating the original 
          grid with different numerical values.  A reclassified file of a 
          100x100 km square area of 10 metre grid cells would be a few 
          hundred bytes, rather than 100 megabytes of uncompressed 8-bit 
          raster data.
        </P

><P
>          The acceptance of de-facto standard data models.  While competitors 
          created cumbersome (and in many cases secretive) data formats, 
          GRASS accepted the de-facto standard Digital Line Graph vector 
          format and unheaded binary raster grid format.  GRASS later 
          abandoned DLG as its internal vector file format, and let its 
          raster format evolve.  However, DLG and the unheaded binary raster 
          grid are still routinely handled formats for GRASS, and its new 
          formats are as open as its previous ones.

>          GRASS code was managed in several directories.  Initial 
          contributions were placed in the src.contrib directory.  More solid 
          code was moved to the src.alpha directory.  After remaining in the 
          src.alpha for one full release cycle, the code, with resultant bug 
          fixes, moved to the most honorable level, the src directory.

      GRASS was overseen by three levels of oversight committees.  USA/CERL 
      kept the ultimate responsibility for GRASS.  It implemented most GRASS 
      development, and carried out the day-to-day management of GRASS testing 
      and release.  The GRASS Interagency Steering Committee (GIASC), 
      comprised of other Federal agencies, met semi-annually to review 
      development progress, and evaluate future directions for GRASS.  
      (Academic and commercial participants in GRASS also attended GIASC 
      meetings; only part of each meeting was "Federal-Agencies-only."  GRASS 
      eventually became nominally and officially a "product" of the GIASC, 
      though everyone recognized USA/CERL's leadership role.  The GRASS 
      Military Steering Committee met periodically to review the progress of 
      GRASS in serving its original intent: meeting the Department of 
      Defense's needs to evaluate and manage the environment of military 
      lands.  
    </P
><P
>      The public interacted with CERL and GIASC through USA/CERL's GRASS 
      Information Center.  GRASS Beta testing was very widespread, and quite 
      intensive for the leading users of GRASS.  Several leading users, such 
      as the National Park Service and the Soil Conservation Service, selected 
      GRASS as its prime or only GIS.  They made significant commitments to 
      enhance and test GRASS, yet considered this investment well worth their 
      while.  They said that they had more influence over the direction of 
      GRASS than they would over any known alternative system.  They also felt 
      that, despite their major efforts and expenses in supporting GRASS, they 
      had a bargain in relevant power for the dollar.
    </P
><P
>      Several universities adopted GRASS as an important training and research 
      environment.  Many conducted short-courses for the public, in addition 
      to using GRASS in their own curricula.  Examples of such leading 
      academic users of GRASS are Central Washington University, The 
      University of Arkansas, Texas A &#38; M University, The University of 
      California at Berkeley, and Rutgers University.
    </P
><P
>      Though GRASS received some criticism (some say) for being so good and so 
      public, it was also reputedly borrowed from liberally by some developers 
      of other systems.  Though the first group might have viewed it as unfair 
      competition, the second group may have noted that it was not copyright, 
      and was a valuable testbed for GIS concepts.  GRASS received an award 
      from the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) for 
      quality software in 1988.
    </P
><P
>      As CERL and GRASS evolved through the late 1980s and early 1990s, CERL 
      attempted to cut overhead costs associated with supporting the public 
      domain version.  It created and initially funded the Open GRASS 
      Foundation, in cooperation with several of the leading users of GRASS.  
      The Open GRASS Foundation has since evolved into the Open GIS 
      Consortium, which is aiming for more thorough interoperability at the 
      data and user interface level, but appears not to be taking advantage of 
      the major open GIS testbed (GRASS).
    </P
><P
>      In 1996 USA/CERL, just before beginning the beta testing for GRASS 
      version 5.0, announced that it was formally withdrawing support to the 
      public.  USA/CERL announced agreements with several commercial GISs, and 
      agreed to provide encouragement to commercialization of GRASS.  One 
      result of this is

>,
      a commercial adaptation of much of GRASS.  Another result is a migration of 
      several former GRASS users to COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) GISs.  
      However, GRASS' anonymous ftp site contains many enhancements to the 
      last full version 4.1 release of GRASS.  Many organizations still use 
      GRASS feeling that, despite the lack of a major release in five years, 
      GRASS still leads the pack in many areas.
