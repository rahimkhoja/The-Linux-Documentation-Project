The GRASS4.15 for Linux was compiled in my Linux box with the 
following configuration:
        Slackware 3.0
        kernel 1.2.13
        gcc 2.7.0
        libc 5.0.9
        flex 3.5.2

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ IMPORTANT: ~

THE LINUX GRASS 4.15 BINARIES ONLY WORK ON ELF-LINUX. THE BINARIES MAY 
NOT WORK WITH EARLY VERSION OF KERNEL AND/OR GCC AND FLEX.

The binaries was tared and gziped, then split into 9 (close to 1.3 MB 
- 1200 x 1K block) files named from linuxg.aa to linuxg.ai.

You should ftp all the linuxg.a* in binary mode and also get this 
readme file and an installation script - install.sh.  Please put all 
of these files in the same directory - source directory.

At the source directory under the UNIX prompt, type
        sh ./install.sh full_path_to_the_destination_directory

and it should automatically unzip and untar the linuxg.a* files to the 
destination directory and also edit several site-specific files.  The 
total space your need is about 26 MB.

At the destination directory, your can find the grass4.1 script.  It 
should have been modified to reflect your installation directory.  
Now, either move/copy the grass4.1 file to one of your PATH or use the 
link command as below:
        cd /usr/local/bin
        ln -s destination_directory/etc/grass4.1 grass4.1

Now, you are ready to start GRASS by typing grass4.1 and you should
know how to run GRASS afterward.

There is a readme directory in the destination_directory/etc 
directory.  This directory has several readme files that come with 
some incoming commands.  You can find all the compiled commands of 
this binaries in the commands.readme file.  I can't guarantee that all 
of them work but I have tested lots of them.  If you find some 
commands that don't work, please post a message on the grass user 
group and we can solve it all together.
