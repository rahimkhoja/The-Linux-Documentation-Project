>      GRASS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a public domain 
      raster based GIS, vector GIS, image processing system, and graphics 
      production system.  Created by the US Army Corps of Engineers, 
      Constriction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) and enhanced by 
      many others, it is used extensively at government offices, universities 
      and commercial organizations throughout the world. It is written mostly 
      in C for various UNIX based machines.  Linux is one of its more robust 
      implementations.
    </P
><P
>      GRASS contains over 40 programs to render images on monitor and paper; 
      over 60 raster manipulation programs; over 30 vector manipulation 
      programs; nearly 30 multi-spectral image processing manipulation 
      programs; 16 data management programs; and 6 point file management 
      programs.  
    </P
><P
>      GRASS' strengths lie in several fields. The simple user interface makes 
      it an ideal platform for those learning about GIS for the first time.  
      Users wishing to write their own code can do so by examining existing 
      source code, interfacing with the documented GIS libraries, and by using 
      the GRASS Programmers' Manual. This allows more sophisticated 
      functionality to be fully integrated within GRASS.
    </P
><P
>      Other strengths include GRASS' pioneering of mixed resolutions in a data 
      base, mixed geographic coverage areas in a data base, raster image 
      compression techniques via run-length encoding and reclassification 
      lookup tables, GRASS' rescaling of display images on the fly to fill the 
      display screen, plus its fundamental design criterion of powerful 
      computer-assisted scientific analysis of environmental issues (as 
      opposed to merely going for intricate cartographic output of relatively 
      simple processes).
    </P
><P
>      GRASS is usually supplied as free, non-copyright source code to be 
      compiled on host machines.  Some compiled binaries are also easily 
      obtainable at no cost via the Internet.  It runs on a variety of UNIX 
      platforms.
