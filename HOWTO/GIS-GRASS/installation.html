      Before actually installing GRASS, you will have to decide where to put 
      three parts of the system:

          documentation, and the like.  Many folks put this stuff off 
          /usr/local (e.g. /usr/local/grass/bin, /usr/local/grass/src).
        </P

>          The GRASS executable and gmake utilities.  Some folks put this 
          stuff off /usr/local (e.g. /usr/local/grass/grass4.1 and gmake4.1 
          or /usr/local/bin/grass4.1 and gmake4.1).
        </P

          specified in configuration files.
        </P
><P
>          I have used a different scheme for a decade.  As GRASS code, binaries, 
          and the like (except data owned by users) are all owned by the special 
          user "grass" I don't want this stuff to get spread around my system.  I 
          create a new directory (usually on a separate file system) called /user, 
          and put all my GRASS stuff below this.  For example:

>          The GRASS Installation Guide (described in Section 10 and in Appendix C)
          is useful for getting GRASS running, even if you merely install the 
          binaries as described in Appendices A and B.  Please don't overlook one 
          important detail:  Most GRASS installations separate user from software 
          manager accounts and UNIX permissions.  You should create a "grass" (the 
          quotes here are for emphasis, and should not be part of the actual user 
          userid) user account on your workstation.  All installation and 
          configuration of grass should be done by user "grass".  Untar (or 
          un"cpio" files, run setup configuration utilities, run Gmakefiles (GRASS 
          versions of makefiles), and edit configuration files as user "grass."  
          Then only RARELY run GRASS as user "grass."  (I only run GRASS as user 
          "grass" when I am making archival data files in the PERMANENT mapset.)  
          This is done for much the same reason as not running user software as 
          user "root".  YOU CAN DO TOO MUCH DAMAGE AS USER "grass"!
        </P
><P
>          Beyond the instructions in these appendices, and information in the 
          GRASS Installation Guide, you have some additional housekeeping to do, 
          such as developing a data base.  You can acquire sample data bases from 
          USA/CERL (directory pub/grass/grass4.1/data at anonymous "ftp 
          moon.cecer.army.mil"), start from scratch following instructions in the 
          GRASS Programmer's Manual (and, to a lesser degree, buried in the 
          functional descriptions of the GRASS User's Reference Manual).
        </P
><P
>          I personally recommend that you start with the Spearfish and Global 
          databases available from USA/CERL:

>              The Spearfish data base covers two 7.5 minute topographic sheets in 
              the northern Black Hills of South Dakota, USA.  It is in the 
              Universal Transverse Mercator Projection.  It was originally 
              created by Larry Batten (now of the Environmental Systems Research 
              Institute's office in Boulder, Colorado) while he was with the U. 
              S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center in South Dakota.  The data 
              base was enhanced by USA/CERL and cooperators.  It is an excellent, 
              and well-used (there are many training materials available for 
              GRASS with this data base) example of a county-scale GIS project in 
              the UTM projection.

>              The Global data base was developed by Bob Lozar of USA/CERL to 
              prototype a latitude-longitude "projection" data base in GRASS for 
              global environmental study and decision support.

>          Starting with these two examples, you can build your own data bases in 
          UTM and latitude-longitude projections.  (Note, many people don't call 
          latitude-longitude a projection.  Others disagree, saying that anything 
          that transfers the Earth's surface to two dimensions is a projection..  
          We'll stay away from that debate here.  Needless to say, lat-lon is 
          treated as other projections are by the computer program.)
