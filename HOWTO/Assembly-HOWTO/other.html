>3.4.1. AS86</H2
><P
>&#13;AS86 is a 80x86 assembler (16-bit and 32-bit) with integrated macro support.
It has mostly Intel-syntax, though it differs slightly as for addressing modes.
Some time ago it was used in a several projects, including the Linux kernel,
but eventually most of those projects have moved to GAS or NASM. AFAIK, only
ELKS continues to use it.
</P
><P
>&#13;AS86 can be found at

http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/, in the bin86 package with linker (ld86),
or as separate archive. Documentation is available as the man page and as.doc
from the source package. When in doubt, the source code itself is often a good
doc: though it is not very well commented, the programming style is
straightforward. AS86 is part of a number of BSD and Linux distributions.

>3.4.2. YASM</H2
><P
>&#13;YASM is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the "new" BSD License.
It is designed from the ground up to allow for multiple syntaxes to be
supported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object
formats including COFF, Win32 and Mach-O. Another primary module of the overall
design is an optimizer module.

><P
>&#13;FASM (flat assembler) is a fast, efficient 80x86 assembler that runs in
'flat real mode'. Unlike many other 80x86 assemblers, FASM only requires the
source code to include the information it really needs. It is written in itself
and is very small and fast. It runs on DOS/Windows/Linux and can produce flat
binary, DOS EXE, Win32 PE, COFF and Linux ELF output. See
http://flatassembler.net.

>3.4.4. OSIMPA (SHASM)</H2
><P
>&#13;osimpa is an assembler for Intel 80386 processors and subsequent, written
entirely in the GNU Bash command interpreter shell. The predecessor of osimpa
was shasm. osimpa is much cleaned up, can create useful Linux ELF executables,
and has various HLL-like extensions and programmer convenience commands.
</P
><P
>&#13;It is (of course) slower than other assemblers. It has its own syntax (and uses
its own names for x86 opcodes) Fairly good documentation is included. Check it
out: 
ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/cLIeNUX/interim/ (Access is password
controlled). You will probably not use it on regular basis, but at least it
deserves your interest as an interesting idea.

>3.4.5. AASM</H2
><P
>&#13;Aasm is an advanced assembler designed to support several target architectures.
It has been designed to be easily extended and, should be considered as a good
alternative to monolithic assembler development for each new target CPUs
and binary file formats.
</P
><P
>&#13;Aasm should make assembly programming easier for developer, by providing
a set of advanced features including symbol scopes, an expressions engine,
big integer support, macro capability, numerous and accurate warning messages.
Its dynamic modular architecture enables Aasm to extend its set of features
with plug-ins by taking advantages of dynamic libraries.
</P
><P
>&#13;The input module supports Intel syntax (like nasm, tasm, masm, etc.).
The x86 assembler module supports all opcodes up to P6 including MMX, SSE
and 3DNow! extensions. F-CPU and SPARC assembler modules are under development.
Several output modules are available for ELF, COFF, IntelHex, and raw binary
formats.

it as a compiler to any target microprocessor using a table that defines the

>&#13;
HLA is a <EM

<EM
>A</EM
>ssembly language. It uses a high level language like
syntax (similar to Pascal, C/C++, and other HLLs) for variable declarations,
procedure declarations, and procedure calls. It uses a modified assembly
language syntax for the standard machine instructions. It also provides several
high level language style control structures (if, while, repeat..until, etc.)
that help you write much more readable code.
</P
><P
>&#13;HLA is free and comes with source, Linux and Win32 versions available. On Win32
you need MASM and a 32-bit version of MS-link on Win32, on Linux you need GAS,
because HLA produces specified assembler code and uses that assembler for final
assembling and linking.

</P
><P
>&#13;TAL stands for <EM
>T</EM

>A</EM
>ssembly
<EM
>L</EM
>anguage. It extends traditional untyped assembly
languages with typing annotations, memory management primitives, and a sound
set of typing rules, to guarantee the memory safety, control flow safety,and
type safety of TAL programs. Moreover, the typing constructs are expressive
enough to encode most source language programming features including records
and structures, arrays, higher-order and polymorphic functions, exceptions,
abstract data types, subtyping, and modules. Just as importantly, TAL is
flexible enough to admit many low-level compiler optimizations. Consequently,
TAL is an ideal target platform for type-directed compilers that want to
produce verifiably safe code for use in secure mobile code applications or
extensible operating system kernels.

handy sometimes.
</P

>&#13;The assembler's look and feel are based on Turbo Pascal's internal BASM, and
the IDE supports similar highlighting, and FPC can fully integrate with gcc
(on C level, not C++).

successfully runs under Win32s, Win95, Win/NT. It includes a free 32-bit
assembler (either prefix or postfix syntax) integrated into the reflective

language FORTH; however, the only supported input and output contexts is
Win32For itself (no dumping of <TT

>&#13;Terse is a programming tool that
provides <EM

family! However, it is evil proprietary software. It is said that there was a
project for a free clone somewhere, that was abandoned after worthless pretenses
that the syntax would be owned by the original author. Thus, if you're looking
for a nifty programming project related to assembly hacking, I invite you to
develop a terse-syntax frontend to NASM, if you like that syntax.

>&#13;You may find more about them, together with the basics of x86 assembly
programming, in the
Raymond Moon's x86 assembly FAQ.
</P
><P
>&#13;Note that all DOS-based assemblers should work inside the Linux DOS Emulator,
as well as other similar emulators, so that if you already own one, you can
still use it inside a real OS. Recent DOS-based assemblers also support COFF
and/or other object file formats that are supported by the GNU BFD library,
so that you can use them together with your free 32-bit tools, perhaps using
GNU objcopy (part of the binutils) as a conversion filter.
