<P>Finally, I want to make some very practical, even mundane, suggestions
for anyone wanting to found, maintain, or grow a LUG.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc6.1">LUG support organisations</A>
</H2>


<P>There once were numerous organisations offering assistance to LUGs.
One of the long-time ones remains active:</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B>Tux.Org:</B><DD><P>Tux.Org is an umbrella organisation for
LUGs and open-source software development projects, providing
a corporate entity, Web hosting, mailing lists, mirrors of 
popular software, and expertise and funding in planning special
LUG events.  More information can be found at the
<A HREF="http://www.tux.org/">http://www.tux.org/</A>
Web site.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc6.2">Founding a LUG</A>
</H2>


<P>
<UL>
<LI>Determine the nearest existing LUG.</LI>
<LI>Announce your intentions on <CODE>comp.os.linux.announce</CODE> and on an appropriate regional hierarchy.</LI>
<LI>Announce your intention wherever computer users are in your area: bookstores, swap meets, cybercafes, colleges corporations, Internet service providers, etc.</LI>
<LI>Find friendly businesses or institutions in your area willing to help you form the LUG.</LI>
<LI>Form a mailing list or some means of communication among the people who express an interest in forming a LUG.</LI>

<LI>Solicit space on a Web server to put a few HTML pages together about the group.</LI>
<LI>Begin looking for a meeting place.</LI>
<LI>Schedule an initial meeting.</LI>
<LI>Discuss at the initial meeting the goals for the LUG.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc6.3">Maintaining and growing a LUG</A>
</H2>


<P>
<UL>
<LI>Make the barriers to LUG membership as low as possible.</LI>
<LI>Make the LUG's Web site a priority: Keep all information current, make it easy to find details about meetings (who, what, and where), and make contact information and feedback mechanisms prominent.</LI>
<LI>Install distributions for anyone who wants it.</LI>
<LI>Post flyers, messages, or handbills wherever computer users are in your area.</LI>
<LI>Secure dedicated leadership.</LI>
<LI>Follow Linus Torvalds's <I>benevolent dictator</I> model of leadership.</LI>
<LI>Take the big decisions to the members for a vote.</LI>
<LI>Start a mailing list devoted to technical support and ask the "gurus" to participate on it.</LI>
<LI>Schedule a mixture of advanced and basic, formal and informal, presentations.</LI>
<LI>Support the software development efforts of your members.</LI>
<LI>Find way to raise money without dues: for instance, selling GNU/Linux merchandise to your members and to others.</LI>
<LI>Consider securing formal legal standing for the group, such as incorporation or tax-exempt status.</LI>
<LI>Find out if your meeting place is restricting growth of the LUG.</LI>
<LI>Meet in conjunction with swap meets, computer shows, or other community events where computer users -- i.e., potential GNU/Linux users -- are likely to gather.</LI>
<LI>Elect formal leadership for the LUG as soon as practical: Some helpful officers might include President, Treasurer, Secretary, Meeting Host (general announcements, speaker introductions, opening and closing remarks, etc.), Publicity Coordinator (handles Usenet and e-mail postings, local publicity), and Program Coordinator (organises and schedules speakers at LUG meetings).</LI>
<LI>Provide ways for members and others to give feedback about the direction, goals, and strategies of the LUG.</LI>
<LI>Support GNU/Linux and free software / open source development efforts by donating Web space, a mailing list, or an ftp site.</LI>
<LI>Establish an ftp/Web site for relevant software.</LI>
<LI>Archive everything the LUG does for the Web site.</LI>
<LI>Solicit "door prizes" from GNU/Linux vendors, VARs, etc. to give away at meetings.</LI>
<LI>Give credit where due.</LI>
<LI>Submit your LUG's information to all the LUG lists.</LI>
<LI>Publicise your meetings on appropriate Usenet groups and in local computer publications and newspapers.</LI>
<LI>Compose promotional materials, like PostScript files, for instance, members can use to help publicise the LUG at workplaces, bookstores, computer stores, etc.</LI>
<LI>Make sure you know what LUG members want the LUG to do.</LI>
<LI>Release press releases to local media outlets about any unusual LUG events like an Installation Fest, Net Day, etc.</LI>
<LI>Use LUG resources and members to help local non-profit organisations and schools with their Information Technology needs.</LI>
<LI>Advocate the use of our OS enthusiastically but responsibly.</LI>
<LI>Play to LUG members' strengths.</LI>
<LI>Maintain good relations with vendors, VARs, developers, etc.</LI>
<LI>Identify and contact consultants in your area.</LI>
<LI>Network with the leaders of other LUGs in your area, state, region, or country to share experiences, tricks, and resources.</LI>
<LI>Keep LUG members advised on the state of software -- new kernels, bugs, fixes, patches, security advisories -- and the state of the GNU/Linux world at large -- new ports, trademark and licensing issues, where Torvalds is living and working, etc.</LI>
<LI>Notify the Linux Documentation Project -- and other pertinent sources of GNU/Linux information -- about the documentation the LUG produces: technical presentations, tutorials, local HOWTOs, etc.</LI>
