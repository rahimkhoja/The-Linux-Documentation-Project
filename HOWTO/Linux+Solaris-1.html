<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why Solaris?</A>
</H2>

<P>This is actually a good
question. Why use Solaris, when you can have Linux?  Solaris is a
commercial system, the hardware support is scarce. But if you are
reading this you have probably already decided on using Solaris. If
not, here are some reasons:
<UL>
<LI> I have a part-time job administrating Solaris
machines. It is of no use that I learning all the neat
command parameters and nifty Linux tricks at home, when
I can't use them on my Solaris-Box.</LI>
<LI> Sun was giving away Solaris for what they call
``Shipping and handling cost only'' for some time. They
might do that again. And almost-free-of-charge is always
a good deal.</LI>
<LI> Another reason might be that you like CDE.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Things covered in this HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>This HOWTO tries to help you install Solaris 7 or 8 on an x86
computer already running Linux. The main targets are
<UL>
<LI>not to destroy any data, see section
<A HREF="Linux+Solaris-2.html#harddrive">Preparing your Harddrive</A></LI>
<LI> To make Linux and Solaris coexist (boot manager),
see section
<A HREF="Linux+Solaris-5.html#boot">Boot-Managing</A></LI>
<LI> To share data between Linux and Solaris, as described in
section 
<A HREF="Linux+Solaris-6.html#sharing">Sharing Data</A></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Referenced versions</A>
</H2>

<P>The reference versions used while creating this
document where:
<UL>
<LI>Solaris 7 x86 (= Solaris 2.7 / SunOS 5.7)</LI>
