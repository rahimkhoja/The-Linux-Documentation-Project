<P>There is one problem that occurs often enough to mention here.  If you 
get the following error:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
/lib/modules/2.4.2-2/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.o
init_modules: Device or resource busy
Hints: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters;
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters.<P>perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded...
<P>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

then you are probably running Red Hat 7.x.  The folks at Red Hat, in all 
their wisdom, decided to load the ipchains module by default on startup.
I guess this was for backwards compatibility for those who haven't learned
iptables yet.  However, the problem is that ipchains and iptables are
mutually incompatible.  Since ipchains has been secretly loaded by RH, you
cannot use iptables commands.  To see if this is your problem, do the 
command ``lsmod'' and look for the module named ``ipchains''.  If you 
see it, that is your problem.  The quick fix is to execute the command
``rmmod ipchains'' before you issue any iptables commands.  To permanently
remove these commands from your startup scripts, the following command
should work:  ``/sbin/chkconfig --level 2345 ipchains off''.
(Thanks to Rasmus Glud for pointing this command out to me).
