<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Linux architecture-specific initialization</A></H2>

<P>
<P>(from "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S")
<P>The boot code in "linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S" transfers execution
to the beginning code in "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S"
(labeled "startup_32:").
<P>To get to this point, a small uncompressed kernel function
decompresses the remaining compressed kernel image
and then it jumps to the new kernel code.
<P>This is a description of what the "head.S" code does.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 startup_32:</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>swapper_pg_dir is the top-level page directory, address 0x00101000.
<P>On entry, %esi points to the real-mode code as a 32-bit pointer.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Set segment registers to known values</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Set the %ds, %es, %fs, and %gs registers to __KERNEL_DS.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 SMP BSP (Bootstrap Processor) check</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
<P>If %bx is zero, this is a boot on the Bootstrap Processor (BSP),
so skip this.  Otherwise, for an AP (Application Processor):
<P>If the desired %cr4 setting is non-zero, turn on the paging options
(PSE, PAE, ...) and skip "Initialize page tables" (jump to "Enable paging").
<P>#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Initialize page tables</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Begin at pg0 (page 0) and init all pages to 007 (PRESENT + RW + USER).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Enable paging</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Set %cr3 (page table pointer) to swapper_pg_dir.
<P>Set the paging ("PG") bit of %cr0 to <BR>
<B>********** enable paging **********</B>.
<P>Jump $ to flush the prefetch queue.
<P>Jump *[$] to make sure that %eip is relocated.
<P>Setup the stack pointer (lss stack_start, %esp).
<P>#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
<P>If this is not the BSP (Bootstrap Processor), clear all flags bits
and jump to checkCPUtype.
<P>#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Clear BSS</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The BSP clears all of BSS (area between __bss_start and _end)
for the kernel.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 32-bit setup</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Setup the IDT for 32-bit mode (call setup_idt).
setup_idt sets up an IDT with 256 entries pointing to the default
interrupt handler "ignore_int" as interrupt gates.  It doesn't actually
load the IDT; that can be done only after paging has been enabled
and the kernel moved to PAGE_OFFSET.  Interrupts
are enabled elsewhere, when we can be relatively
sure everything is OK.
<P>Clear the eflags register (before switching to protected mode).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Copy boot parameters and command line out of the way</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>First 2 KB of _empty_zero_page is for boot parameters,
second 2 KB is for the command line.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 checkCPUtype</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Initialize X86_CPUID to -1.
<P>Use Flags register, push/pop results, and CPUID instruction(s) to
determine CPU type and vendor:
Sets X86, X86_CPUID, X86_MODEL, X86_MASK, and X86_CAPABILITY.
Sets bits in %cr0 accordingly.
<P>Also checks for presence of an 80287 or 80387 coprocessor.
Sets X86_HARD_MATH if a math coprocessor or floating point unit is found.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10 Count this processor</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>For CONFIG_SMP builds, increment the "ready" counter to keep a tally
of the number of CPUs that have been initialized.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.11">4.11 Load descriptor table pointer registers</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Load GDT with gdt_descr and IDT with idt_descr.
The GDT contains 2 entries for the kernel (4 GB each for code and
data, beginning at 0) and 2 userspace entries (4 GB each for code and
data, beginning at 0).  There are 2 null descriptors between the
userspace descriptors and the APM descriptors.
<P>The GDT also contains 4 entries for APM segments.
The APM segments have byte granularity and their bases and limits
are set at runtime.
<P>The rest of the gdt_table (after the APM segments) is space for
TSSes and LDTs.
<P>Jump to __KERNEL_CS:%eip to cause the GDT to be used.  Now in <BR>
<B>********** protected mode **********</B>.
<P>Reload all of the segment registers:
Set the %ds, %es, %fs, and %gs registers to __KERNEL_DS.
<P>#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
<P>Reload the stack pointer segment only (%ss) with __KERNEL_DS.
<P>#else /* not CONFIG_SMP */
<P>Reload the stack pointer (%ss:%esp) with stack_start.
<P>#endif /* CONFIG_SMP */
<P>Clear the LDT pointer to 0.
<P>Clear the processor's Direction Flag (DF) to 0 for gcc.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.12">4.12 Start other processors</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>For CONFIG_SMP builds,
if this is not the first (Bootstrap) CPU, call initialize_secondary(),
which does not return.  The secondary (AP) processor(s) are
initialized and then enter idle state until processes are
scheduled on them.
<P>If this is the first or only CPU, call start_kernel(). (see below)
<P>/* the calls above should never return, but in case they do: */
<P>L6:  jmp L6
