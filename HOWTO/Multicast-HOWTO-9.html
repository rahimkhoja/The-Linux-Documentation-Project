<P>So far we have been talking about multicast transmissions using UDP. This
is the usual practice, as it is impossible to do it with TCP. However,
intense research is taking place since a couple of years in order to develop
some new multicast transport protocols. 
<P>Several of these protocols have been implemented and are being tested. A good
lesson from them is that it seems no multicast transport protocol is general
and good enough for all types of multicast applications.
<P>If transport protocols are complex and difficult to tune,
imagine dealing with delays (in multimedia conferences), data loss, ordering,
retransmissions, flow and congestion control, group management, etc, when
the receiver is not one, but perhaps hundreds or thousands of sparse hosts.
Here scalability is an issue, and new techniches are implemented, such as
not giving acknowledges for every packet received but, instead, send <EM>negative
acknowledges</EM> (NACKs) for data not received. RFC 1458 gives the proposed
requirements for multicast protocols.
<P>Giving descriptions of those multicast protocols is out of the scope of this
section. Instead, I'll give you the names of some of them and point you to
some sources of information: Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is concerned
with multi-partite multimedia conferences, <B>Scalable Reliable Multicast</B> (SRM) is
used by the <CODE>wb</CODE> (the distributed White-Board tool, see section 
<A HREF="Multicast-HOWTO-5.html#sect-applications">Multicast applications</A>),
<B>Uniform Reliable Group Communication Protocol</B> (URGC) enforces reliable and
ordered transactions based in a centralized control, <B>Muse</B> was developed as an
application specific protocol: to multicast news articles over the MBone, the
<B>Multicast File Transfer Protocol</B> (MFTP) is quite descriptive by itself
and people "join" to file transmission (previously announced) much in the same 
way they would join a conference, <B>Log-Based Receiver-reliable Multicast</B> 
(LBRM) is a curious protocol that keeps track of all packets sent in a logging 
server that tells the sender whether it has to retransmit the data or can
drop it safely as all receivers got it. One protocol with a funny name 
-especially for a multicast protocol- is STORM (<B>STructure-Oriented 
Resilient Multicast</B>). Lots and lots of multicast protocols can be found
searching the Web, along with some interesting papers proposing new
activities for multicast (for instance, www page distribution using multicast).

drafts, RFCs, papers, links to other sites) is:

<A HREF="http://hill.lut.ac.uk/DS-Archive/MTP.html">http://hill.lut.ac.uk/DS-Archive/MTP.html</A> is also a good source
of information on the subject.
<P>Katia Obraczka's "<EM>Multicast Transport Protocols: A Survey and Taxonomy</EM>" 
article gives short descriptions for each protocol and tries to classify them 
according to different features. You can read it in the IEEE Communications 
magazine, January 1998, vol. 36, No. 1.
