<P>Fundamentally, this document is made in two sections: the first,
for the machines with a big hard disk and a working graphical interface,
the second, for other which are in low resources, forced to work by
typing from the command line.</P>

</H2>

<P>Of course, if you have a working graphical interface, to configure
everything is very easy. As a matter of fact, starting from release 8.0,
each Mandrake-Linux release comes with <EM>drakconf</EM> package.
Other disrtibutions have their own control-center. This wizard allows
to change the settings of

<P>Now let me explain how you can change X server configuration through
the following two steps.</P>
<H3>Step 1</H3>

<P>Linux operating system uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
called XFree, just because it is a free version of X windows system,
wich was developed by X.org website members, also getting some IBM contyibutions.
Today, X server configuration is totally automatic, so in the end
of your new Linux system installation, if you are lucky, you can reboot,
without having anything to do. Nevertheless, often it happens that,
in spite of an installation of a lot of packages, it display a message
saying that you are not able to start X server.
The reason why this happens is that your monitor, or your graphic card,
is not rightly detected. So you have only to update the whole
installation, until to the Summary. Here, you can change your graphical
interface settings, but, be very careful, when the opportunity knocks:
when ask, disable the automatic starting Option for X server after the
reboot. This allows to use your PC in text mode, so if you want to
start X server, you have manually to run "startx" command.</P>
<H3>Step 2</H3>

<P>If X server doesn't work yet, try with</P>
<P><CODE># XFdrake</CODE></P>
<P>It allows to change current settings with minimal ones:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Monitor:                SVGA (not interlaced) 1024 x 768
Frequency:              60 Hz
Graphic card:           VGA standard
Resolution:             640 x 480
Colours dept.:          8 bpp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You can increase these values, by degrees, but without overclocking
frequency speed. It may damages your monitor! When you are ready, run
XFdrake again and select to start Xfree, upon booting.
This has always worked for me, so I suggest you to write down these
values, before.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="Config-HOWTO.html#toc2.3">Keyboard</A>
</H2>

<P>First of some old raw applications, upon which was built current
control-center. Of course if you work by typing from command line,
it is very important to set your keyboard accordingly. For many
countries and keyboard types appropriate keymaps are available already.
So you can give "loadkeys" command followed by the two last letters of
any your country URLs.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="Config-HOWTO.html#toc2.4">Users</A>
</H2>

<P>Expecially if you want autologin, you have to add an
user. Type "adduser" command, then set up his password whith "passwd -n",
followed by the user name.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="Config-HOWTO.html#toc2.5">Mouse</A>
</H2>

<P>If you chose to work by typing from command line only,
you have no need to configure your mouse. Nevertheless, whith a
working graphical interface you cannot use itself to change wrong
settings. Open a console as a root user and type "mousedrake".</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6</A> <A HREF="Config-HOWTO.html#toc2.6">Printer</A>
</H2>

<P>Lastly, if you want to set up your printer, you have
to install CUPS driver. Type "printerdrake".</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7</A> <A HREF="Config-HOWTO.html#toc2.7">Bootloader</A>
</H2>

<P>The program which loads the kernel into the memory at the boot time
is called bootloader. The bootloaders that come with Linux distributions
are LILO and GRUB. If you want change LILO configuration, you have to open
the file /etc/lilo.conf. using your favorite editor. In this file each
line has its meaning. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
boot=/dev/hda              Install LILO in the MBR
prompt                     If you want select another section
timeout=50                 Wait five seconds before booting
default=linux              The section to boot after the timeout

image=/boot/vmlinuz-x.x.x
  label=Linux              Name we give to this section
  read-only                Start with a read-only root
  root=/dev/hda3           Location of the root filesystem

other=/dev/hdaX            The host where Windows is installed
  label=windows
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 Typical is how GRUB refers to hard drives and
partitions.</P>

</H2>

<P>If your system is attached directly to Internet, or
is on a large public network, enable it to help prevent unauthorized
access.</P>
