<H2><A NAME="s6">6. How do I automate the connection procedure?</A></H2>

<P>Automated handling of news and email is quite easy to implement
in Linux.
<P>First and foremost one should make a
<!--
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on
-->
 /usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on
that initiates the ISP connection.  Often, this file will simply
contain the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/pppd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
pppd
-->
 Further specification will be performed in
<!--
/etc/ppp/options
-->
 /etc/ppp/options:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
connect "/usr/lib/ppp/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscript"
crtscts
modem
defaultroute
asyncmap 00000000
user dirk
/dev/modem 38400
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To end a connection, use the supplied version of
<!--
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off
-->

/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off.
<P>Having tested the functionality of these two scripts, one must
then write scripts that perform the various tasks. The script to
collect email has been described before, and we will here assume
it is located at /home/dirk/pop.
<P>A script for exchange of email can then be produced in
/root/mail:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
# exchange mail
# 10 minutes timeout:
TIMEOUT=600
DT=10

# kick sendmail:
sendmail -q &amp;

# retrieve mail:
su dirk -c /home/dirk/pop

# wait for sendmail to terminate:
t=0
while ! mailq | grep -q "Mail queue is empty"; do
    t=$[$t+$DT]
    if [ $t -gt $TIMEOUT ] ; then
     echo "sendmail -q timeout ($TIMEOUT).."
     exit 1
    fi
    sleep $DT
done

exit 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The script to exchange news may be placed in
/usr/lib/news/news:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# exchange news
# must be run as news:
cd /usr/lib/news

#update the outgoing batch (C News):
/usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun &lt; /dev/null

#exchange news:
/usr/lib/newsbin/newsx acme news.acme.xz

#and flush the incoming batch:
/usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun &lt; /dev/null
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

A script to connect the various bits and pieces remains, and can
be placed in /root/news+mail:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# exchange news and email
# must be run as root
#
if ! /usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on; then
    exit 1
fi
trap "/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off" 1 2 3 15

#exchange news+mail:
/root/mail &amp;
su news -c ~news/news
wait

#disconnect..
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-off

#update the incoming batch (C News):
su news -c /usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun &lt; /dev/null &amp;

exit 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is quite easy to make an extension to the above that only will
establish a connection if outgoing email and news is present.
Lets call it 
<!--
/root/news+mail.cond
-->

/root/news+mail.cond, and keep in mind that the name
of the outgoing news-spool must be updated to suit:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# exchange news and email, only if outgoing news or mail
# (C News spool)
if [ -s /var/spool/news/out.going/acme/togo ] ||
    ! ( mailq | grep -q "Mail queue is empty"); then
     /root/news+mail
fi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The only thing remaining is to specify when all this is going to
happen.  This is done using the command <CODE>crontab -e</CODE>
<!--
crontab
-->
 as root.  Let us assume that we always want
to exchange news and mail at 07:00 in the morning, and after that
every 4th hour assuming there are outgoing email and news:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
00 7            * * *   /root/news+mail
00 11,15,19,23  * * *   /root/news+mail.cond
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Ensure that every component is tested well before you connect
them together. One may later add several other tasks, such as
adjustment of the time of day (using 
<!--
ntpdate
-->

ntpdate), and automatic update (mirroring) of
locally maintained WWW and FTP files up to the ISP (using make
and ftp).
<P><B>ALT:</B> Depending on ones preferences, it is also possible
to turn the process upside down. Every time a PPP link is
initiated, the script 
<!--
/etc/ppp/ip-up
-->

/etc/ppp/ip-up will be started.  One may here add
whatever magic is required to start exchange of email and news.
See <CODE>man pppd</CODE> for further detail.
<P><B>ALT:</B> It is also possible to automatically connect PPP
whenever network traffic is detected.  This is in many ways the
more elegant solution, but it is quite dependent on a good
configuration to avoid frequent (and costly) connections being
made.  More information can be found at:
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.dna.lth.se/~erics/diald.html">http://www.dna.lth.se/~erics/diald.html</A></CODE>
<P>The <CODE>diald</CODE> utility is available from:
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/diald-0.16.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/diald-0.16.tar.gz</A></CODE>
<P>At the same location one will also find other variations on the
theme PPP connections.
