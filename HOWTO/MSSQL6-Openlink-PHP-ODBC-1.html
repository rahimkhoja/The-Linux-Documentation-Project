<P>This document describes how to connect to MS SQL 6.x+ database server
via ODBC functions of PHP3(3.0.1x or above) compiled with Openlink
drivers under Linux.
<P>In the Unix world, people may hate to be invoked with any M$ related
software. However, in the real world, the boss may require you to
store data in a MS SQL database on NT and run web application on
Linux. What to do? Quit the job or sit down to read this document? If
you choose latter, I will give you a detailed installation guide so
that you can keep the job for a while. It is a How-to guide, not a
Why-so guide. So don't ask me why abc instead of cba. I don't know
either.
<P>PHP is becoming more and more popular in web programmers, mainly
because it can be configured to connect to various databases like
Oracle, MySQL, Solid and so on. But for a MS SQL server, the problem
is different. Though you can use PHP's Sybase-ct support features to
directly connect to MSSQL, many people (at least me) prefer to
connect via ODBC.
<P>Utilizing Openlink ODBC middleware, you can use those ODBC_xxxx
functions to connect to all the database Openlink has a driver for.
You have to install Openlink Linux client and Server middleware and
re-compile PHP to support ODBC functions. In the end, I made a script
sample for reference.
