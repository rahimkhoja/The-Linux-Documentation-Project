<P>According to the formal GNU philosophy, each language that
is present in the GCC (ie. for languages having separate front ends)
should have a subdirectory of its own. So the first thing the 
GCC expects from us is a separate directory . Let us create 
a new subdirectory in the srcdir/gcc with the name of our 
language (say 'demo').
<P>As explained before gcc expects a number of files and 
functions. In our directory also there should be some files 
present. The first thing that should be present is a make file.
It is divided into two, Make-lang.in and Makefile.in. Both are
part of the main make file of gcc. 
<P>Make-lang.in is actually included in the main make file
of the gcc and from there (objdir/gcc) it calls the make 
in the language
directory. So the filenames should be provided with full path
names. Don't try to give relative ones. The file gives 
information about the source files of our language. So it is
here that we should specify the files that is required for
our language.
<P>Makefile.in is used to create the make file in the language
directory. It is included in the language directory. 
<P>The third file expected by the gcc is config-lang.in. It is
used by the file srcdir/gcc/configure (a shell script).
<P>The fourth file gcc expects is lang-specs.h. This file
helps in the modification of the gcc driver program. The driver
has to understand the presence of our new language. This is neatly
accomplished by this file. It is here that the details like extensions
of our language exists. You can specify them according to 
your taste.
<P>Now the most important thing. No one is expecting you to
create all these files from scratch. The best method is to copy
these files from any existing directory and make the relevant 
changes. The changes may include some modifications in the name of the 
language, the files used by us, the extensions of our choice etc.
<P>All the information provided are from my observation 
and sometimes there may be variations in the above details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Call back routines </A>
</H2>

<P>     
As already explained we are going to use a major part
of the gcc for compiling our language. So it is our responsibility 
to define some functions and variables which are used by the
back end. Most of them are of no direct help to us. But back end
expects it, so we should provide it. 
<P>As in the above case it is better to copy from some 
existing front ends. But let's have a general idea of what each
function is. If you find this section boring you can skip
this section but don't skip the inclusion of these routines
in your program.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
type_for_size(unsigned precision, int unsignedp)
</PRE>

It returns a tree of integer type with number of bits given by the 
argument precision. If unsignedp is nonzero, then it is unsigned
type, else it is signed type.

<P>
<PRE>
type_for_mode(enum machine_mode mode,int unsignedp)
</PRE>

It returns a tree type of the desired mode given by us. mode 
represents machine data type like whole number. unsignedp, as 
usual is used for obtaining an unsigned type or else a signed type
is returned.

</PRE>

Returns the unsigned version of type_node.
<P>
<PRE>

</PRE>

It is nonzero when a 'BLOCK' must be created for the current

another binding level is covered when entered into a new level.
<P>
<PRE>
