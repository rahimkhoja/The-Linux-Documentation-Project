><P
>    Put simply, XDM (the X Display Manager) can be thought of as a graphical
    replacement for the command line 'login' prompt.  In reality, it can
    actually do much more than that.
    </P
><P
>    Typically, it would be started by the 'root' user (or the system startup
    scripts) on power up, and would present a user with a graphical login
    prompt.  It will then manage the users X session once they login -
    i.e. it will initiate the running of their window manager and applications.
    </P
><P
>    This could be considered a typical 'simple local machine login'
    configuration, as may be found installed by many Linux distributions
    by default.  However, XDM can also manage remote X servers and provide
    login prompts to remote 'X terminals'.  In short, it is not limited to
    the local machine - it can easily manage other machines connected via
    a network.
    </P
><P
>    XDM is a very configurable utility and this document will only just
    'scratch the surface' of what may be achieved.  This document aims to
    provide enough information to configure your X terminals and application
    servers to connect to each other.  The reader is referred to 
    <A
HREF="resources.html"
>Section 7</A
> for further information on the topics
    discussed here.
    </P
><P
>    A note on security: X (in its default configuration) and XDMCP are not
    particularly secure.  I am assuming that you are running X on a
    'trusted' network and that security is not an issue.
    For details of how to tighten up your X connections
    (and more details about using the networking capabilities of X) please
    refer to the 'Running Remote X Applications' Howto document, which is
    also part of the LDP (see <A
HREF="resources.html"
>Section 7</A

NAME="XDM-XTERM">3.2. What is an X terminal</H2

>    This term could be used to cover various configurations, but at its
    simplest, is a machine with a network connection, keyboard,
    mouse and monitor, configured to run the X Windows System to connect
    to an application server somewhere on the network.
    </P
><P
>    There are several configurations of 'X terminal' with varying levels
    of functionality, ranging from completely diskless terminals to full
    X workstations.

    in this document.  When talking about X, there is quite a lot of
    confusion over what is serving facilities to what.  This is especially
    true when you are considering distributed sessions over a network
    involving X terminals.  I will be using the terms described below.

>        This would be a machine with no local disks, that would perform its
        boot up from an EPROM (or similar) and utilises a network connection to a
        server.  It would obtain its
        network configuration, operating system, system configuration and all
        applications from the server.  Once booted however, this
        would be the same as a 'dumb X terminal' (see below).  Typically this
        configuration would use a combination of the following network protocols
        in order to boot: BOOTP, DHCP, TFTP, etc.  Refer to
        <A
HREF="resources.html"
>Section 7</A

        for some references that detail how to build diskless X terminals.

>Dumb X terminal</DT
><DD
><P
>        This would be a machine that boots from its local disk into an operating
        system, and starts the 'X server' program and nothing more.  Somehow, a login
        prompt would be provided on the machine, to enable a user to login to an
        'application server' somewhere on the network.
        </P

>X Workstation</DT
><DD
><P
>        This would be similar to a dumb X terminal, but would provide the option
        of logging on to the local machine itself, hence would be quite capable of
        becoming a standalone workstation (i.e. no network connectivity) if required.
        Most distributions can be configured 'out of the box' as a stand-alone
        X Workstation, with a graphical login prompt.
        </P

>Application Server</DT
><DD
><P
>        In the context of this document, I use the term 'application server' to
        describe a machine that will provide the applications (X clients) that our X
        terminal will want to run.  This can include everything from editors and browsers,
        through to the actual 'Window Manager' itself.
        </P

>X Server</DT
><DD
><P
>        This is the program that manages the display of a machine with a physical
        console (display, keyboard, mouse, etc).  It can be thought of as a combined
        graphics card, keyboard and mouse 'driver'.
        This will provide these facilities as a service to X clients (hence the term
        'server').  Please refer to the X User Howto in
        <A
HREF="resources.html"
>Section 7</A

        for more details.

>X Client</DT
><DD
><P
>        This is an application that requires the use of an X server to access
        input (keyboard and mouse) and output (display).  An X client cannot produce
        output without the services of the X server. The X server could be
        running locally (on the same machine, as is the case with an X
        workstation) or elsewhere on the network
        (as is the case with an X terminal connecting to an Application Server).

    machine.

    listed above and will describe the role that XDM can play in configuring
    them.

NAME="XDM-DO">3.4. What can XDM do</H2
><P
>    XDM is responsible for providing the user with a login
    prompt and initiating their X session.  It can manage local sessions (i.e. people
    logging into an X workstation) or sessions on remote machines, via a connection
    to an application server, from a diskless or dumb X terminal.
    </P
><P
>    XDM would typically run on an application server, to permit users to logon
    and run applications from that server.
    </P
><P
>    There are 2 main ways that XDM can interact with an X Server:

NAME="XSERV-QUERY">3.4.1. XDM accepts queries from X Server</H3
><P
>      The communications between XDM and the actual 'X server' (the machines
      with the physical screen/keyboard/mouse/etc) are handled via XDMCP the
      'X Display Manager Control Protocol'.
      </P
><P
>      This permits X servers to send out queries to servers running XDM.
      Effectively, the X server has to say 'I have someone wanting to login -
      please give me a login prompt'.  In this mode of operation, XDM will
      not do anything unless it is asked to by your X server.
      </P
><P
>      The query from the X server can take one of 3 forms:
      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>          Direct query: the X server contacts a named host, requesting that XDM
          on that host presents a login prompt on its display.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          Broadcast: the X server sends out a broadcast message to the network,
          and the first server running XDM that responds to the broadcast will
          be the one to present the login prompt on its display.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          Indirect query: the X server contacts a named host, but asks it which
          other hosts it knows about on the network.  The named host will then
          present the user with a list of hosts to choose from, and will then
          go on to initiate communications with the selected host resulting in
          the selected host presenting a login prompt on the X servers display.
          </P

      </P
><P
>      There are several other options, but these will not be described here

NAME="XDM-SERVER">3.4.2. XDM Manages X Server</H3
><P
>      If you have a set of machines (e.g. diskless or dumb X terminals) that just
      end up running an X server, all designed to provide a login prompt to a
      single application server, then it is possible to configure XDM on the
      application server to connect back to each X server and present its login
      prompt on each display automatically.
      </P
><P
>      In this mode of operation, XDM will actively 'push out' a login prompt
      to any listed X server that it knows about, without waiting for
      a query from the X servers themselves.
      </P
><P
>      In this case, the configuration file 'Xservers' (see later) lists each
      machine (including the local display, if required) to which XDM should
      connect, to display its login prompt.
      </P
><P
>      This configuration, when used with no remote X servers listed in the
      configuration, is the typical configuration used for a X workstation,
      in order to present a user with a graphical login to the local machine
      he is working on.  As stated earlier, most distributions will support
      this configuration 'out of the box' in order to present the user with
      a local graphical login prompt.
      </P
><P
>      Note: XDM must be permitted to connect to the X servers in question - so
      the access control on the X servers must be configured accordingly.
