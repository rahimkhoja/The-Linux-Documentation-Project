</H2>

<P>Quota allows you to specify limits on two aspects of disk storage: the
number of inodes a user or a group of users may possess; and the number of
disk blocks that may be allocated to a user or a group of users.
<P>The idea behind quota is that users are forced to stay under their disk
consumption limit, taking away their ability to consume unlimited disk space
on a system. Quota is handled on a per user, per file system basis. If there
is more than one file system which a user is expected to create files, then
quota must be set for each file system separately. Various tools are
available for you to administer and automate quota policies on your
system.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Current Status of Quota on Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Currently, there are some major changes in the way quota works. There are two 
different setups. The tools works the same, but there's a difference in used files. This 
document describes the setup and operation of the _new_ quota setup. As the new setup 
of quota is not in the regular kernel source, this setup needs some patching. We will describe this
patching and installation of the linuxquota package. If you already have the quota software installed
on your system, you may or may not have to install this patch and package. You can email me if 
you have any questions about this. I'll try to include a overview of Linux distro's and it's implications
in a later version of this document.
