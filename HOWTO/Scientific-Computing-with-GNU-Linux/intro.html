>&#13;  GNU/Linux is probably the platform of choice for scientific
  computing. There exists a wide variety of high level languages,
  debugging tools and other code development tools for
  programming, numerical subroutines for solving various types of
  equations, plotting and visualization packages, word processing
  software which can display equations and figures and in fact parallel
  programming software to construct a supercomputer with off the shelf
  PC parts and some hardware. This document aims to provide a list
  of <EM
> free software </EM
> for carrying out the above
  tasks and links to tutorials and other documents on how to setup and
  use these software applications.
 </P
><P
>&#13;  This document does not aim to provide links to subject specific free
  software available for GNU/Linux systems. It aims to show how
  GNU/Linux can be used best to handle scientific computing tasks.
  It is hoped that people or institutions with interest in a
  specific subject list, compile a list of the free software available
  for that subject ... for example see <EM
>Linux for Astronomy,
  Linux for Biotechnology </EM
> and <EM
> Linux for
  Chemistry </EM
> at
  <A
HREF="http://www.randomfactory.com"

>The Random Factory
  </A
>. Another site with a lot of links (to commercial and
  free) scientific software is
  <A

>Scientific Applications
  on Linux</A
>. The <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/directory/science/"

>&#13;  GNU Software Directory</A
> also has links to many of the links
  provided in this howto plus many more topic specific software.

>&#13;   Just installing GNU/Linux on your PC makes it a powerful workstation.
   The various popular distributions however do not have all the tools
   needed to make it the ideal scientific computing machine. This HOWTO
   aims to fill in this gap by creating a list of free software useful
   for scientific computing. It is assumed that people reading this
   document already have a PC with Linux and the GNU utilities installed.
   For those who do not have such a setup and want to install GNU-Linux
   can check out <A
HREF="./GNULinuxWS.html"
TARGET="_top"
>GNU/Linux Systems</A
>
   for links to documents on installing GNU/Linux, and also on how to get
   started using GNU/Linux. Recently there has been an effort by Dirk
   Eddelbuettel to create a scientific computing environment
   <A
HREF="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Quantian</A
>
   which probably is the first GNU-Linux distribution tailored for
   Scientists. I checked out the latest release and it has almost
   all the packages mentioned in this document and many packages
   not mentioned. It is fair to say that if you have any linux distribution
   in which the packages are managed by rpms or any debian based system,
   you will find pre-compiled binaries of these packages and will not
   have to waste much time installing them.
