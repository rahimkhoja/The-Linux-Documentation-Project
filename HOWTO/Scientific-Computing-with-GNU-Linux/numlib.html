>&#13;   The best thing that could happen for scientific computing with free
   software on GNU/Linux is the GNU Scientific Library
   <A

>GSL</A
>.
   It however has source code only in C and people who use FORTRAN
   will find that a let down. Pouncing on this opportunity it is
   recommended that GSL is another reason (in addition to the GCC
   C compiler, coupled with the advantages of C programming)
   for starting to learn to use C. In addition to this,
   the two best source code repositories for Numerical Methods and
   libraries are <A

   and <A
HREF="http://math.nist.gov/"

>GAMS</A

   There are new numerical packages being developed outside the usual
   "write a FORTRAN program, get a numerical subroutine from INTERNET
   for solving the numerics" concepts. The merits and demerits of this
   approach are debatable, but there exist more options like

        GAMS has a very useful search using which one can search for
        keywords (example: ``diffusion'' to search for a diffusion equation
        solver). However the browse by package at GAMS reveals that a lot of
        the software they provide is a link to the netlib repository.

        The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of numerical routines
        written from scratch in C. It provides an Applications Programming
        Interface (API) for C programmers and also allows wrappers to be written
        for very high level languages. It covers a wide range of numerical
        computing topics, has a good manual, is widely portable and is distributed
        under the GNU General Public License.

        GiNaC is designed to allow the creation of software which need symbolic
        manipulations embedded in them. It extends C++ by a set of algebraic
        capabilities and is recursively named for GiNaC is not a Computer Algebra
        system. It is distributed under the terms and conditions of the GNU
        general public license (GPL).

  FFTW is a collection of fast C routines for computing the Discrete
  Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions.  It includes complex,
  real, and parallel transforms, and can handle arbitrary array sizes
  efficiently.  This package includes both the double- and
  single-precision FFTW uniprocessors and the threads libraries.

>LAPACK</A

  LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a standard library for numerical
  linear algebra.  LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of
  simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear
  systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
  problems. LAPACK is coded in Fortran77 and is built with egcs.
  It is well documented and widely used (and therefore widely tested).

  SuperLU is a general purpose library which performs an LU decomposition
  for the direct solution of large, sparse, non-symmetric systems of linear
  equations on high performance machines. Its written in C and is callable
  from either C or Fortran.
