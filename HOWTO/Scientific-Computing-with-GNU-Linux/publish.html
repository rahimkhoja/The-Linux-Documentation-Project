>Latex</A

    LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system, with features designed for
    the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the
    de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific
    documents.

>&#13;    David R.Wilkin's primer </A
> "Getting Started with LaTeX"
    is a good tutorial to getting started with LaTeX.
    For those who have to live with a WYSIWYG documenting tool, check
    <A

>LyX</A
>. This is a front-end for
    latex. It isn't as powerful as latex proper, but helps with a good WYSIWIG.

   A document formatting system similar to latex. Good features, documentation
   and history. Light weight and outputs postscript. Thanks to Emiliano Gavilan
   for this link.

    As the AbiWord home page says,
    "AbiWord is suitable for typing papers, letters, reports, memos, and so forth".
    It has won many awards and seems to be the best open source WYSIWYG word
    processor. Check out the above link to know more about it and download it.

    As the kword home page says,
    "KWord is a FrameMaker-like word-processing and desktop publishing application.
     KWord is capable of creating demanding and professional looking documents.
     Whether you are a corporate or home user, production artist or student, KWord
     will prove a valuable and easy to use tool for all your word processing and
     layout needs". Check out the above link to know more about it and download it.

>&#13;     KPresenter</A
>:
     KPresenter is the presentation tool of the KOffice suite of office
     utilities. It allows screen presentations with all the trappings one
     is used to seeing in costly presentation tools. It also allows honest,
     real scientific presentations where one does not have to impress the
     audience with non subject specific stuff :-). The best thing about it
     is the possibility of saving the presentation as a html file. It makes
     portable network graphics files with each presentation slide. With a
     smattering of knowledge of html files one could put in a animated image
     as a image link thereby allowing one to show movies too when necessary.

HREF="http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig/"
TARGET="_top"
>Xfig </A
>:
     Though the man page claims that it is a facility for the
     interactive generation of figures ...., It in fact much more than that.
     Other than generating figures for elucidating what you want to say in
     a poster, it helps you import and export figures in a variety of formats,
     write text in various fonts and sizes, generate Greek symbols and color
     text, Save as latex picture file or any other format supported by your
     word processor for inclusion in your publications, generate GIFs of each
     page of the poster to put on your web site, and finally it generates
     *.fig files which are small in size. The only thing on my wish list for
     xfig is the capability to edit the imported pictures which are not in
     *.fig format. Therefore for a computer screen projected poster
     presentation you need a frames capable browser with contents in one frame
     and the xfig generated posters (exported as *.png or *.jpg from Xfig) on
     the other.
