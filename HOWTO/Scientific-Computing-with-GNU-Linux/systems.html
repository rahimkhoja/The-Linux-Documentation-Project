>7. Programming systems for GNU/Linux</H1
><P
>&#13; This section deals with links to tutorials and documents for installing
 Linux on a PC,  getting started with Linux, and then going a step further
 -- to optimize your PC for processing power, using multiple processors
 (Symmetric Muliti Processing - SMP);  making a cheap, upgradeable
 Supercomputing Linux cluster and finally links to software to do parallel
 programming on Linux.

>7.2. Parallel Processing and Symmetric Multiprocessing:
        Supercomputing</H2
><P
>&#13;  It is possible to get large volume number crunching without
  spending millions of rupees on a supercomputer. You only need
  to link together (by some high speed network) the requisite
  number of CPUs, with GNU/LINUX as the underlying OS. Add
  some freely available message passing software and a effective
  parallel processing number crunching machine is made. Such
  clusters are called "Beowulf clusters". The other advantages
  of such a cluster other than building costs is, up-gradation
  costs are minimal. The two best resources for Linux cluster
  builders are

>7.2.2. Parallel processing software for Linux</H3
><P
>&#13;   Now after reading the above documents, you have an idea of parallel
   processing. Parallel program libraries are the core of parallel processing
   on a Linux cluster. There are various free implementations of parallel
   processing libraries. Since parallel processing is all about performance,
   these libraries have some very nice functional tools to analyze your parallel
   program performance. Given below is a set of links to these parallel
   program libraries and tools.

>Local Area Multicomputer
    - LAM</A
>:
    LAM (Local Area Multicomputer) is an MPI programming environment and
    development system for heterogeneous computers on a network.
    With LAM, a dedicated cluster or an existing network computing
    infrastructure can act as one parallel computer solving one problem.
    LAM features extensive debugging support in the application development
    cycle and peak performance for production applications.  LAM features a
    full implementation of the MPI communication standard.
    You can download the sources (tar-zipped, rpm) or binaries from
    <A

    A host of MPI tutorial links and also a `getting started with LAM'

>&#13;    Parallel Virtual Machine </A
>:
    As the PVM home page describes, it is a software package that permits
    a heterogeneous collection of Unix and/or NT computers hooked together
    by a network to be used as a single large parallel computer. Thus large
    computational problems can be solved more cost effectively by using the
    aggregate power and memory of many computers. The software is very
    portable. The source, which is available free thru netlib, has been
    compiled on everything from laptops to CRAYs.

>Ganglia</A
>:
    Ganglia is an open source cluster monitoring and execution environment
    developed at the University of California, Berkeley Computer Science
    Division. As the above link describes it, "Ganglia is as simple to
    install and use on a 16-node cluster as it is to use on a 512-node
    cluster as has been proven by its use on multiple 500+ node clusters".
    It not only can link nodes in a cluster, but also link clusters to other
    clusters.
