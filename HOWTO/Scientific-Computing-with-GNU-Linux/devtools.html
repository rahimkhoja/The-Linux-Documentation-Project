     GNU's project to produce a world class optimizing compiler.
     It works on multiple architectures and diverse environments.
     Currently GCC contains front ends for C, C++, Objective C,
     GNU Fortran-95, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these languages
     (libstdc++, libgcj,..).

    </A
>:
     The GCC front end for FORTRAN 77. It is a very good FORTRAN77
     compiler. It however does not have the -r8 option which compiles
     a program as double precision. This could be a good compiler
     design philosophy but in many cases gives problems when porting
     a code from SUN / DEC / HP workstations onto Linux systems.
     The g77 manual is available at

    I was happy to receive this link by mail. It was 3 years since I had
    migrated to using the GNU C compiler for scientific computing because
    there was no "truly free" FORTRAN-95 compiler available then. I thank
    Paul Thomas for this link.

>&#13;    fort77 and f2c</A
>:
    fort77 is a perl program which invokes the f2c command
     (a Fortran to C translator) transparently, so it can
     be used just like a real Fortran compiler. Fort77 can
     be used to compile Fortran, C and assembler code and
     can link the code with f2c libraries. If you install
     fort77, you'll also need to install the f2c package.
     This does not have the "-r8" problem. You can download
     fort77 and f2c from the above link.

     An object-oriented programming language, which combines the flexibility
     of an interpretive language, with the efficiency of a compiled language.
     It has full interfaces to numerical libraries (GSL, LAPACK, BLAS),
     graphics libraries (OpenGL), which allows creation of graphics and 3D
     animations and many other features that sound too good to be
     true. I have not yet tried this out, but it sounds very promising.

     You may want to explore

HREF="http://www.python.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Python</A
> for your
     scientific computing needs. Python is an interpreted,
     interactive, object-oriented programming language.

     It has a number of extensions for numerics, plotting,
     data storage and combined with Tk lets you develop very
     good GUIs for your codes. The most exciting aspect is that
     it simplifies programming because it has modules for almost
     anything (vectors, tensors, transformations, derivatives,
     linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, etc ...) are
     available. You can also wrap C and Fortran libraries from
     Python. Finally if you want to write a numerical scheme of
     your own you may find that it is simpler in Python.
     There are also interfaces to netCDF (portable binary files),
     MPI and BSPlib (parallel programming).

>Ftnchek:</A
>
     A FORTRAN checker designed to detect errors in a Fortran
     program that a compiler usually does not. Therefore it is best
     to run ftnchek on your FORTRAN programs after it has compiled
     without errors. Its purpose is to assist the user in finding
     semantic errors. Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
     language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.
     An on-line <A

     which then compiles your code with debugging information inserted
     into the executable. It can start your programs, stop your programs
     on specified conditions and at specified locations, examine what
     happened when your program stops. In a large code with multiple
     cascading calls to various functions it can back trace the function
     calls. You can also

     PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end to a set of
     tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of files and
     directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of the entire set.
     PRCS was designed primarily by Paul N. Hilfinger, with input and
     modifications by Luigi Semenzato and Josh MacDonald. PRCS is written and
     maintained by Josh MacDonald.  Its purpose is similar to that of SCCS,
     RCS, and CVS, but (according to its authors, at least), it is much simpler
     than any of those systems. This page is where information on the latest
     developments in PRCS can be found. </P
