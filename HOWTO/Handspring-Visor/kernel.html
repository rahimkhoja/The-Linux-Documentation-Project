><P
>	    Some obvious things are required, such as a computer,
	    USB ports, Handspring Visor (with USB cradle).
	    You should also know how to compile and install programs 
	    and the kernel. If you do not, you have a few options:
	    learn, get your resident expert to help you, or get a distro
	    with everything prepared for you. 
	</P
><P
>	    If you don't have a USB controller for your computer, then 
	    you need to either buy the serial cradle for the Visor
            (but you wont need this document), or buy a USB-capable 
            device for your computer (ie. add-on card or a new 
            motherboard).

TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</A
>. 
	</P
><P
>            The USB code has been backported to the v2.2 kernel, starting
            at version v2.2.18.  If you must, you should probably be
            able to follow the same instructions with the latest v2.2 kernel
	</P
><P
>            Now would be a good time to download the latest kernel, and
            configure things to your desire.  The following has the
            instructions you need to configure USB.
        </P
><P
>            If you have already have compiled and installed the kernel,
            you should not need to reboot!  All we need to do is
            to compile and install the appropriate modules, and we
            will be all set.

            unable to sync using this driver.  If you are unable to
            see the original driver, ensure that the UHCI-JE driver
            is NOT selected, you should then see the option for both
            drivers.

	    Here, you should decide if you would like to include

            Hotsync button.  Please see the
