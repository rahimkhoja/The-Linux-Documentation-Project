<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Using the Sentry Firewall CDROM</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> The configuration scripts which are run from /etc/rc.d/rc.S first look for
a configuration file called 'sentry.conf' on a floppy disk which, if present,
will be mounted on /floppy.  In order to configure the Linux system for use
in any particular environment the user must have the ability to replace the
system default files with his/her own copies.  The 'sentry.conf' file basically
tells the configuration scripts which files it should replace and where those
files are.
<P>A good example of a sentry.conf file can be found on the Sentry Firewall CD
in the directory /SENTRY/scripts/cd-config/.  Configuration floppy disk
images(1.44M) can also be found in /SENTRY/images/ on the CD.  These files are also
available on the website, 
<A HREF="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">http://www.SentryFirewall.com/</A><P>
<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The sentry.conf file</A>
</H2>

<P> The main configuration file for the system is called 'sentry.conf'.  It will
first be looked for on a floppy disk(/dev/fd0).  The file accepts several
configuration directives, many of which will be discussed below.
<P><BR>
<H3>Example</H3>

<P>A basic configuration file looks like the following (everything after a '#'
sign is interpreted as a comment):
<P>
<PRE>
----snip----
## Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file(sentry.conf)

rc.local = /floppy/config1/rc.local
fstab = /floppy/config1/fstab

passwd = /floppy/config1/passwd
shadow = /floppy/config1/shadow

# EOF #
----snip----
</PRE>
<P>The syntax is pretty simple, the default 'rc.local' file will be replaced with
the user defined 'rc.local' file located in the '/floppy/config1/' directory.  Same
goes for 'fstab', 'passwd', and the 'shadow' file.   But it is important to
remember, the first place the sentry.conf file will be looked for is on
/dev/fd0, which if found, will be mounted on /floppy.  This is why all these
files appear to be located in the /floppy directory, it is simply the mount
point for the floppy disk.
<P><B>NOTE:</B> As of version 1.3.0, a user may now omit the `/floppy'
prefix.  So, for example a line in sentry.conf that says the following:
<P>
<PRE>
   shadow = config1/shadow
</PRE>
<P>Will be assumed to mean(in most cases) the following:
<PRE>
   fstab = /floppy/config1/shadow
</PRE>

As long as /floppy/config1/shadow exists.
<P>
<P><BR>Unfortunately, you cannot arbitrarily replace files, for example the
following will likely not be parsed correctly:
<PRE>
     foo.conf = /floppy/config1/foo.conf
</PRE>
<P>The configuration scripts only recognize a certain number of configuration
files, so it probably won't know what to do with "foo.conf".  There are other
very easy ways to copy configuration files into their proper location, however.
These methods will be discussed below.
<P>
<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Network Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P> As of version 1.0.5, a new syntax for the configuration directives are
recognized; those with an "http://" or "ftp://" prefix.  This basically means
that the following syntax is now supported:
<PRE>
     inetd.conf = ftp://[user:pass@]123.123.123.123/config1/inetd.conf
     hosts = http://[user:pass@]123.123.123.123/config1/hosts
</PRE>
<P>As of version 1.3.0, "https://", "scp://", and "sftp://" URLs are also supported.
For example:
<PRE>
     shadow = scp://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@123.123.123.123/dir/shadow
     passwd = sftp://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@123.123.123.123/dir/passwd
     fstab = https://[user:pass@]123.123.123.123/dir/fstab
</PRE>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> The username and password fields are required when retrieving files
via scp or sftp.  Empty passwords are not permitted.
<P>
<P><BR>In order to accomplish this the configuration scripts need to have the
ability to set up an ethernet interface, as well as obtain nameserver
information from the sentry.conf file.  The syntax to accomplish this is the
following:
<PRE>
     device{1..10} = &lt;device&gt;:&lt;driver&gt;:&lt;IP address&gt;[|Gateway_IP]

     or..

     device{1..10} = &lt;device&gt;:&lt;driver&gt;:dhcp[|Hostname]
</PRE>
<P>And to set up a nameserver:
<PRE>
     nameserver = &lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<P><BR>Additionally, when retrieving files using "http", "https", or "ftp",
you may also set up a proxy server.  The following directives will allow you
to do so (they may not all be required for your setup):
<PRE>
     http_proxy = http://&lt;hostname&gt;/
     ftp_proxy = http://&lt;hostname&gt;/
     proxy-user = &lt;PROXY_USER&gt;
     proxy-passwd = &lt;PROXY_PASSWORD&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<P>Passive FTP may also be required.  If so, use the 'passive-ftp' option, ie:
<PRE>
     passive-ftp = &lt;on|off>  ## Default == off
</PRE>
<P>
<P><BR>So, for example to set up an interface called "eth0", which uses the "tulip"
driver and can obtain its ip address from a DHCP server, we can use the
following line:
<PRE>
     device1 = eth0:tulip:dhcp
</PRE>
<P>
<P> As you can see, a total of 10 devices are allowed.  Let's say we now want to
set up an interface "eth1" that uses an "rtl8139" chip, and has a static
IP(192.168.1.2) and a default gateway(192.168.1.1):
<PRE>
     device2 = eth1:8139too:192.168.1.2|192.168.1.1
</PRE>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> It is important to keep in mind that whatever devices you set up during the
configuration process will be promptly taken down after the configuration is
complete.  This setup is only used so you can retrieve configuration files over
the network, via http(s)/ftp/scp/sftp.  For more permanent network configuration, please
use the rc.inet1 file.
<P>
<P><BR>
<H3>Example</H3>

<P>
<PRE>
----snip----
## Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file to retrieve files via HTTP(s)/FTP/SCP/SFTP.

device1 = eth0:tulip:192.168.1.2|192.168.1.1
nameserver = 123.123.123.123  ## This should be the IP of your DNS server.

rc.M = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/rc.M
rc.inet1 = http://user:pass@config.sentry.net/all_nodes/rc.inet1

passwd = scp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/all_nodes/passwd
shadow = sftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/shadow

# EOF #
----snip----
</PRE>
<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Other Useful Configuration Directives</A>
</H2>

<P> Copy file /floppy/someconfig.conf to /etc/someconfig.conf -
<PRE>
     /floppy/someconfig.conf |= /etc/someconfig.conf

     OR, this does the same thing -

     /etc/someconfig.conf = /floppy/someconfig.conf

     and this is also possible(v1.3.0) -

     /etc/someconfig.conf = ftp://&lt;server>/someconfig.conf
</PRE>
<P>Make a symlink called /etc/someconfig.conf that points to
/etc/otherconfig.conf -
<P>
<PRE>
     /etc/someconfig.conf => /etc/otherconfig.conf
</PRE>
<P>The include directive.  Grabs another sentry.conf file either from another
location -
<PRE>
     include = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/sentry.conf
</PRE>
<P>Keep in mind, however, that the include directive is one of the first directives
to be parsed.  Any configuration directives parsed from the included sentry.conf
file that conflict with directives in the previously parsed sentry.conf files
will clobber the old ones.
<P>
<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Putting it all together, managing multiple nodes from a single location.</A>
</H2>

<P> In order to manage multiple nodes at a single location, you can use a bare
sentry.conf file located on a floppy disk, and then grab files from your ftp or
http servers.
<P>
<PRE>
----snip----
## Basic Sentry Firewall CD config file.

device1 = eth0:tulip:dhcp
nameserver = &lt;DNS_IP&gt;
include = ftp://user:pass@config.sentry.net/node1/sentry.conf

----snip----
</PRE>
<P>The included sentry.conf file will then be parsed, and files replaced via http
or ftp if you like.  You can now edit your sentry.conf and configuration files
at a central location.
<P>
<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Example sentry.conf and disk images</A>
</H2>

<P> An example configuration disk image is available on the CDROM.  The disk is
an ext2 formatted disk, and is located in the '/SENTRY/images/' directory on the
CD.  There is also a very complete sentry.conf file on the disk which may help
clarify alot of these directives.  Use a command like the following to create
the configuration disk:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ dd if=/cdrom/SENTRY/images/ext2-144.img of=/dev/fd0
2880+0 records in
2880+0 records out
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The disk images and a sample sentry.conf file can also be found on the website,
