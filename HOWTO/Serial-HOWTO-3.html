<P> Below is an introduction to the topic, but for a more advanced
treatment of it see 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-18.html#fifo_">FIFOs</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Transmitting</A>
</H2>

<P> Transmitting is sending bytes out of the serial port away from the
computer (output).  Once you understand transmitting, receiving
(input) is easy to understand since it's similar.  The first
explanation given here will be grossly oversimplified.  Then more
detail will be added in later explanations.  When the computer wants
to send a byte out the serial port (to the external cable) the CPU
sends the byte on the bus inside the computer to the I/O (Input
Output) address of the serial port.  I/O is often written as just IO.
The serial port takes the byte, and sends it out one bit at a time (a
serial bit-stream) on the transmit pin of the serial cable connector.
For what a bit (and byte) look like electrically see 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-20.html#volt_shape">Voltage Waveshapes</A>.</P>
<P>Here's a replay of the above in a little more detail (but still very
incomplete).  Most of the work at the serial port is done by the UART
chip (or the like).  To transmit a byte, the serial device driver
program (running on the CPU) sends a byte to the serial port"s I/O
address.  This byte gets into a 1-byte "transmit shift register" in
the serial port.  From this shift register bits are taken from the
byte one-by-one and sent out bit-by-bit on the serial line.  Then when
the last bit has been sent and the shift register needs another byte
to send, it could just ask the CPU to send it another byte.  Thus would
be simple but it would likely introduce delays since the CPU might not
be able to get the byte immediately.  After all, the CPU is usually
doing other things besides just handling the serial port.</P>
<P>A way to eliminate such delays is to arrange things so that the CPU
gets the byte before the shift register needs it and stores it in a
serial port buffer (in hardware).  Then when the shift register has
sent out its byte and needs a new byte immediately, the serial port
hardware just transfers the next byte from its own buffer to the shift
register.  No need to call the CPU to fetch a new byte.</P>
<P>The size of this serial port buffer was originally only one byte, but
today it is usually 16 bytes (more in higher priced serial ports).
Now there is still the problem of keeping this buffer sufficiently
supplied with bytes so that when the shift register needs a byte to
transmit it will always find one there (unless there are no more bytes
to send).  This is done by contacting the CPU using an interrupt.</P>
<P>First we'll explain the case of the old fashioned one-byte buffer,
since 16-byte buffers work similarly (but are more complex).  When the
shift register grabs the byte out of the buffer and the buffer needs
another byte, it sends an interrupt to the CPU by putting a voltage on
a dedicated wire on the computer bus.  Unless the CPU is doing
something very important, the interrupt forces it to stop what it was
doing and start running a program which will supply another byte to
the port's buffer.  The purpose of this buffer is to keep an extra
byte (waiting to be sent) queued in hardware so that there will be no
gaps in the transmission of bytes out the serial port cable.</P>
<P>Once the CPU gets the interrupt, it will know who sent the interrupt
since there is a dedicated interrupt wire for each serial port (unless
interrupts are shared).  Then the CPU will start running the serial
device driver which checks registers at I/0 addresses to find out what
has happened.  It finds out that the serial's transmit buffer is empty
and waiting for another byte.  So if there are more bytes to send, it
sends the next byte to the serial port's I/0 address.  This next byte
should arrive when the previous byte is still in the transmit shift
register and is still being transmitted bit-by-bit.</P>
<P>In review, when a byte has been fully transmitted out the transmit
wire of the serial port and the shift register is now empty the
following 3 things happen in rapid succession:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The next byte is moved from the transmit buffer into
the transmit shift register</LI>
<LI> The transmission of this new byte (bit-by-bit) begins</LI>
<LI> Another interrupt is issued to tell the device driver to send
yet another byte to the now empty transmit buffer</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Thus we say that the serial port is interrupt driven.  Each time the
serial port issues an interrupt, the CPU sends it another byte.  Once
a byte has been sent to the transmit buffer by the CPU, then the CPU
is free to pursue some other activities until it gets the next
interrupt.  The serial port transmits bits at a fixed rate which is
selected by the user (or an application program).  It's sometimes
called the baud rate.  The serial port also adds extra bits to each
byte (start, stop and perhaps parity bits) so there are often 10 bits
sent per byte.  At a rate (also called speed) of 19,200 bits per
second (bps), there are thus 1,920 bytes/sec (and also 1,920
interrupts/sec).</P>
<P>Doing all this is a lot of work for the CPU.  This is true for many
reasons.  First, just sending one 8-bit byte at a time over a 32-bit
data bus (or even 64-bit) is not a very efficient use of bus width.
Also, there is a lot of overhead in handing each interrupt.  When the
interrupt is received, the device driver only knows that something
caused an interrupt at the serial port but doesn't know that it's
because a character has been sent.  The device driver has to make
various checks to find out what happened.  The same interrupt could
mean that a character was received, one of the control lines changed
state, etc.</P>
<P>A major improvement has been the enlargement of the buffer size of the
serial port from 1-byte to 16-bytes.  This means that when the CPU
gets an interrupt it gives the serial port up to 16 new bytes to
transmit.  This is fewer interrupts to service but data must still be
transferred one byte at a time over a wide bus.  The 16-byte buffer is
actually a FIFO (First In First Out) queue and is often called a FIFO.
See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-18.html#fifo_">FIFOs</A> for details about the FIFO along
with a repeat of some of the above info.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">Receiving</A>
</H2>

<P> Receiving bytes by a serial port is similar to sending them only
it's in the opposite direction.  It's also interrupt driven.  For the
obsolete type of serial port with 1-byte buffers, when a byte is fully
received from the external cable it goes into the 1-byte receive
buffer.  Then the port gives the CPU an interrupt to tell it to pick
up that byte so that the serial port will have room for storing the
next byte which is currently being received.  For newer serial ports
with 16-byte buffers, this interrupt (to fetch the bytes) may be sent
after 14 bytes are in the receive buffer.  The CPU then stops what it
was doing, runs the interrupt service routine, and picks up 14 to 16
bytes from the port.  For an interrupt sent when the 14th byte has
been received, there could be 16 bytes to get if 2 more bytes have
arrived since the interrupt.  But if 3 more bytes should arrive
(instead of 2), then the 16-byte buffer will overrun.  It also may
pick up less than 14 bytes by setting it up that way or due to
timeouts.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-18.html#fifo_">FIFOs</A> for more details.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc3.3">The Large Serial Buffers</A>
</H2>

<P> We've talked about small 16-byte serial port hardware
buffers but there are also much larger buffers in main memory.  When
the CPU takes some bytes out of the receive buffer of the hardware, it
puts them into a much larger (say 8k-byte) receive buffer in main
memory.  Then a program that is getting bytes from the serial port
takes the bytes it's receiving out of that large buffer (using a
"read" statement in the program).</P>
<P>A similar situation exists for bytes that are to be transmitted.  When
the CPU needs to fetch some bytes to be transmitted it takes them out
of a large (8k-byte) transmit buffer in main memory and puts them into
the small 16-byte transmit buffer in the hardware.  And when a program
wants to send bytes out the serial port, it writes them to this large
transmit buffer.</P>
<P>Both of these buffers are managed by the serial driver.  But the
driver does more than just dealing with these buffers.  It also does
limited filtering (minor modifications) of data passing thru these buffers
and listens for control certain characters.  All this is configurable
using the 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-11.html#stty_">Stty</A> program.</P>
