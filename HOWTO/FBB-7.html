<P>2002-10-20</P>

<P>Well, soon after the installation of LinFBB v7.04
<EM>.rpm</EM> package, I noticed
a new "kid on the block", i.e. a new item within the
Start menu (under Gnome environment). That was a
"HamRadio" group, having several "Xfbb version 7.04"
sub-items and one of them was "xfbbd X Client".</P>

<P>It seemed that a mouse <EM>click</EM> on that
"xfbbd X Client" icon was not likely to return any
response, although <EM>xfbbd</EM> daemon has been successfully
running <EM>before</EM> invoking the client. That's why I have
been asking for help (related to that issue) from other LinFBB
users, but it seemed there was no one capable to solve that
problem. Anyway, it looks to me that there is a "dead" link
from this "xfbbd X Client" icon to an existing executable.</P>

<P>Trying to find a solution, the other day I was browsing the
<B>/usr/sbin</B> directory. I have noticed something that
I have already seen for several times. That was <B>xfbbX</B>
file. Well, I am sure that I tried to use this <EM>executable</EM>
earlier, but without much success. This time, I have entered
the full path, like this:</P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     /usr/sbin/xfbbX
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>and, finally, the GUI client appeared on the screen.</P>

<P>So far - so good. Soon after, I realized that 'Monitoring'
window was capable to monitor the actual traffic on the radio
frequency, but not only that. Headers of all packets appear
in green and the actual information is in blue, so it is easy
to distinguish what is the header and what is the text info
(comparing to my old X11 LinFBB application where everything
came in black).
What I could describe as a disadvantage of the 'Monitoring'
window, is that the scroll bar does not give you much of the
previous, already <EM>scrolled</EM> traffic.</P>

<P>The 'All channels' screen was even better, so the system
user correspondents' traffic appeared in green, the local
user's traffic was in black and the port information was in
yellow. Unfortunately, there's no easy way (if any) to
change colors (and that's the standard feature in WinFBB)
for both 'Monitoring' and 'All channels' windows. Maybe I
haven't managed yet to find a switch for that, so any
useful info about is appreciated.</P>

<P>What I have also found a bit annoying, was that both
windows mentioned above, appear not arranged side-by-side,
a form that would be more suitable. Besides that, the
third window, 'Console', has to be activated with another
mouse click (instead of being activated automatically
with the other two windows). Actually, the whole thing of
<EM>xfbbX</EM> client seems to be primarily useful for
sysops looking only for BBS's command line, in order to
execute some server's commands etc. That's why I have found
a bit strange why the console window must be activated
separately (OK, I know that's the same with WinFBB's
windows, but why not to add some additional feature?)</P>

<P>Anyway, the 'Console' connection window has almost the same
functionality as WinFBB's 'Console' window. Here I think
of the commands given at the BBS's command prompt, because
they are invoked from the usual language *.TXT files.</P>

<P>But, the big disadvantage of today's version of
<EM>xfbbX</EM> client, I've found here, is the absence of
several useful icons, that I was very fond of within
the WinFBB's user interface. For example, there are
no icons for pending mail, users information,
disconnect a user, edit a message text or a header
etc. It looks to me that <EM>xfbbX</EM> developers are
not likely to offer the full comfort that we have
within WinFBB's GUI. It makes me wonder why? There are lots
of commands that can not be easily activated without the
proper icons. It drives me crazy whenever I have to
re-boot to Windows to start WinFBB, in order to perform
some simple tasks mentioned, using the mouse.</P>

<P>Besides that, there is no way to activate that nice
message editor screen, very useful in WinFBB
(also existed in an old Xwindow LinFBB application
v7.00g from 1998!) The same goes for replying
a message, where a sender does not get the text
of a message to be replied to, within the new
message body. In short, I don't like absence of
all those earlier implemented, but now abandoned
features.</P>

<P>Well, I can't imagine what Jean-Paul, F6FBB, and
other developers would do in the future, but I am not
satisfied with the idea to only keep further development
of LinFBB server side, but, in the same time, to abandon
the development of LinFBB's graphical client side. And not
only that: It looks that MS Windows client for LinFBB server,
<EM>xfbbW</EM> has been reported to be much more functional
that described xfbbX, while, in the same time, WinFBB server
development has been also stopped. A bit confusing situation,
isn't it?</P>

<P>Some amateurs think that it is just a result of "global" IT
situation: Linux (as well as other Unix-type platforms) is better
suited for servers, but Windows is better for clients. If so,
it looks that LinFBB packet-radio system operators, "sysop's",
seem to be forced to run at least two computers, in order
to get the same functionality they always had with WinFBB.
I'd rather suggest to Jean-Paul, F6FBB, and other developers
to transfer all known WinFBB's GUI features to <EM>xfbbX</EM>
GUI environment, in order to avoid using two computers.</P>

<P>2002-10-30</P>

<P>A couple of paragraphs ago, I said that "xfbbd X Client" icon
didn't work under Gnome environment. It did make me wonder
if it would work under KDE graphical user interface. So, this
time I started KDE (and I did it as "root" so, in addition, I
also got a mailbox icon on the desktop, named "fbb X11". When I
located the mouse pointer over that icon, there appeared some
more description: "F6FBB bbs Server for Packet Radio").</P>

<P>Well, when I tried to <EM>click</EM> on that icon, I got a
KFM Warning message box explaining that program
<B>/root/.xfbbX</B> could not be executed. Fortunately,
a "right click" on the icon allowed to enter file's Properties.
The Execute card gave me a possibility to change the path
for a program to be used. So, I did some browsing and located
the new path: <B>/usr/sbin/xfbbX</B>. After that, another
<EM>click</EM> resulted in running the GUI client.</P>

<P>Interestingly, there is some slight difference between
<EM>xfbbX</EM> appearance under KDE and Gnome. Actually,
each KDE's <EM>xfbbX</EM> window has "FBB" logo in the upper
left corner (Gnome's windows haven't that). That may indicate
that <EM>xfbbX</EM> client was produced primarily for KDE
environment. Besides that, it seems that other features
are almost the same, regardless being within KDE or Gnome
environment.</P>

<P>On the other side, the already mentioned "xfbbd X Client"
item (within the Start menu, under the "HamRadio" group), still
does not work. I suppose that there should also be some
modifications, related to program executable paths, but I
do not know how to manage that. Anyway, it does not matter
because <EM>xfbbX</EM> is running here this or that way.</P>

<P>2003-06-30</P>

<P>A recent email from Jose, HI8GN, related to the xfbbX GUI client, 
about the RPM package:</P>

<P><EM>"The reason of the why not the xfbbd X Client didn't give you any
answer is for several causes. 1) if the xfbbd daemon is not running
the xfbbd X client won't run. 2) if the xfbbd is dead in its process.
3) if the xfbbd was not shutoff correctly, but delete the xfbbd lock file
as this:</EM></P>

<P><EM>. /etc/init.d/rc.fbb stop or service rc.fbb stop, and then it was run
and didn't create the xfbbd lock file, the shell script looks for the
existence the /var/lock/subsys/xfbbd or /var/lock/subsys/xfbbX lock file
and 4) if the xfbb X11 Server it is running it create a xfbbX lock file
by that the xfbbd X client won't neither run</EM></P>

<P><EM>the same thing makes the X11 Client the one it verifies that the xfbbd is
not running</EM></P>

<P><EM>if you make a click on the Icon that says fbb X11 Client and it doesn't run
it is because the one is seeing that there is a process of the xfbbd
running like as daemon.
the script rc.fbb I have also modified it so that it can not be executed
twice.</EM></P>

<P><EM>if exist xfbbX lock file the xfbbd X client won't run
if exist xfbbd lock file the fbb X11 won't run.</EM></P>

<P><EM>Lastly if you execute the command fbb in the console or in xterminal in
the desktop, you will see what I mean that simple."</EM></P>

<P>Thanks Jose!</P>
