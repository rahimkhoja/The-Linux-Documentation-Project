<P>
<P>There is nothing special about configuring and running mail software under
Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do <EM>NOT</EM> want
to be posting generic mail-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*
newsgroups.
<P>Don't post in comp.os.linux hierarchy unless it's really linux specific, for
example : "Which options was Debian 1.2 sendmail compiled with ?" or "RedHat
5.0 smail crashes when I run it".
<P>Let me repeat that.
<P>There is virtually no reason to post anything mail-related in the
comp.os.linux hierarchy any more.  There are existing newsgroups in the
comp.mail.* hierarchy to handle *ALL* your questions.
<P><EM>IF YOU POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.* FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, YOU ARE
LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR HELP.  THE MAIL EXPERTS HANG OUT IN THE PLACES
INDICATED ABOVE AND GENERALLY DO NOT RUN LINUX.</EM>
<P><EM>POSTING TO THE LINUX HIERARCHY FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WASTES YOUR
TIME AND EVERYONE ELSE'S AND IT FREQUENTLY DELAYS YOUR GETTING THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION.</EM>
<P>GOOD PLACES are :
<PRE>
           comp.mail.elm           the ELM mail system.
           comp.mail.mh            The Rand Message Handling system.
           comp.mail.mime          Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.
           comp.mail.misc          General discussions about computer mail.
           comp.mail.multi-media   Multimedia Mail.
           comp.mail.mush          The Mail User's Shell (MUSH).
           comp.mail.sendmail      the BSD sendmail agent.
           comp.mail.smail         the smail mail agent.
           comp.mail.uucp          Mail in the uucp environment.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Mailing Lists </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are many sendmail, smail and qmail mailing lists.
<P>You can find addresses in /usr/doc/the_one_you_have_chosen.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Other documents from LDP </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There is plenty of excellent material provided in the other Linux HOWTO
documents and from the Linux DOC project.
<P>In particular, you might want to take a look at the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>on your own computer in /usr/doc/ :-)</LI>
<LI>the Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</LI>
<LI>the Mail Users HOWTO</LI>
<LI>the Serial Communications HOWTO</LI>
<LI>the Ethernet HOWTO</LI>
<LI>the UUCP HOWTO if you're fed via UUCP</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Books </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"<CODE>Managing UUCP and USENET</CODE>" from O'Reilly and Associates is in my
opinion the best book out there for figuring out the programs and protocols
involved in being a USENET site.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>Unix Communications</CODE>" from The Waite Group contains a nice
description of all the pieces (and more) and how they fit together.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>Sendmail</CODE>" from O'Reilly and Associates looks to be the
definitive reference on sendmail-v8 and sendmail+IDA.  It's a "must have" for
anybody hoping to make sense out of sendmail without bleeding in the process.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>The Internet Complete Reference</CODE>" from Osborne is a fine
reference book that explains the various services available on Internet and is
a great source for information on news, mail and various other Internet
resources.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>The Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</CODE>" from Olaf
Kirch of the Linux Documentation Project is available on the net and is
also published by (at least) O'Reilly and SSC.

It makes a fine one-stop shop to learn about everything you ever
imagined you'd need to know about Unix networking.
