<P>This document gives you an overview of the Apache world, including
Apache Software Foundation projects such as the Apache web server
and commercial and open source third party software.  Apache is the 
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">most popular server on the Internet</A>. New Apache users, especially those
coming from a Windows background, are often unaware of the possibilities of
Apache, its useful addons and, more in general, how everything works
together. This document aims to show a general picture of such possibilities
with a brief description of each one and pointers for further information.
The information has been gathered from many sources, including projects' web
pages, conference talks, mailing lists, Apache websites and my own hands-on
experience. Full credit is given to these authors. Without them and
their work, this document would not have been possible or necessary.

</H2>

<P><EM>The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of
open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a
collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic
software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads
the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects
sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.</EM>
<P>The ASF is home to many successful Open Source projects, such as the
Tomcat Servlet/JSP engine and the ANT build tool.
<P>You can learn more about the foundation

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Structure of this document</A>
</H2>

<P>The first part of this document deals with the Apache Web Server and
related modules. It covers the history, architecture and capabilities of the
server and describes ways in which you can extend and customize it.
<P>The second part of this document covers projects of the Apache Software
Foundation, such as those form the Jakarta and Java XML communities. Rather
than organizing the projects around a certain programming language or
technology, they are organized based on functionality provided.
