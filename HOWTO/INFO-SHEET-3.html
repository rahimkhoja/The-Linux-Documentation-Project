<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Minimal configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>The following is probably the smallest possible configuration that
Linux will work on: 386SX/16, 1 MB RAM, 1.44 MB or 1.2 MB floppy, any
supported video card (+ keyboards, monitors, and so on of course).
This should allow you to boot and test whether it works at all on the
machine, but you won't be able to do anything useful.
See
<A HREF="http://rsphy1.anu.edu.au/~gpg109/mem.html">http://rsphy1.anu.edu.au/~gpg109/mem.html</A> for minimal
Linux configurations
<P>In order to do something, you will want some hard disk space as well,
5 to 10 MB should suffice for a very minimal setup (with only the most
important commands and perhaps one or two small applications
installed, like, say, a terminal program).  This is still very, very
limited, and very uncomfortable, as it doesn't leave enough room to do
just about anything, unless your applications are quite limited.  It's
generally not recommended for anything but testing if things work, and
of course to be able to brag about small resource requirements.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Usable configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are going to run computationally intensive programs, such as
gcc, X, and TeX, you will probably want a faster processor than a
386SX/16, but even that should suffice if you are patient.
<P>In practice, you will want at least 4 MB of RAM if you don't use X, and 8
MB if you do.  Also, if you want to have several users at a time, or
run several large programs (compilations for example) at a time, you
may want more than 4 MB of memory.  It may still work with a smaller
amount of memory, but it will use virtual
memory (using the hard drive as <B>slow</B> memory) and that will be so
slow as to be unusable.  If you use many programs at the same time, 16 MB will
reduce swapping considerably.  If you don't want to swap appreciably
under normal load, 32 MB will probably suffice for a single user.
If you run lots of memory-intensive applications at once, 64 MB may
be necessary to avoid lots of swapping.  Of course, if
you run memory-hungry applications, you may want more.
<P>The amount of hard disk you need depends on what software you want to
install.  The normal basic set of Unix utilities, shells, and
administrative programs should be comfortable in less than 10 MB, with
a bit of room to spare for user files.  For a more complete system,
get Red Hat, Debian, or another distribution, and assume
that you will need 60 to 600 MB, depending on what you choose to install
and what distribution you get.  Add whatever space you want to
reserve for user files to these totals.  With today's prices on hard
drives, if you are buying a new system, it makes no sense to buy a
drive that is too small.  Get at least 2 GB, preferably 4 GB
or more, and you will not regret it.  Linux will happily handle
very large hard drive such as the recently popular 11 GB IDE hard
drives or 18 GB SCSI hard drives.
<P>Add more memory, more hard disk, a faster processor and other
stuff depending on your needs, wishes and budget to go beyond
the merely usable.  In general, one big difference from DOS is
that with Linux, adding memory makes a large difference,
whereas with DOS, extra memory doesn't make that much
difference.  This of course has something to do with DOS's
640KB limit, which is completely nonexistent under Linux.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Supported hardware</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>CPU:</B><DD><P>Anything that runs 386 protected mode programs.  All
models of 386s 486s, Pentiums, Pentium Pros, Pentium IIs,
and clones of these chips should work.  (286s and
below may someday be supported on a smaller kernel called ELKS
(Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset), but don't expect the same
capabilities).
A version for the 680x0 CPU (for
<EM>x</EM> = 2 with external MMU, 3, 4, and 6) which runs on Amigas
and Ataris can be found at
tsx-11.mit.edu in the 680x0 directory.  Many DEC Alphas, SPARCs,
and PowerPC machines are supported.  Ports are also being
done to the ARM, StrongARM, and MIPS architectures.  More details
are available elsewhere.
<P>
<DT><B>Architecture:</B><DD><P>PCI, ISA, EISA, and VLB busses.  MCA (mostly true
blue PS/2s) support is incomplete but improving (see above).
Linux puts higher demands on hardware than DOS, Windows, and
in fact most operating systems.  This means that some marginal hardware
that doesn't fail when running less demanding operating system may fail
when running Linux.  Linux is an excellent memory tester...
<P>
<DT><B>RAM:</B><DD><P>Up to 1 GB on Intel; more on 64-bit platforms.
Some people (including Linus) have noted that adding ram
without adding more cache at the same time has slowed down
their machine extremely, so if you add memory and find your
machine slower, try adding more cache.  Some machines can
only cache certain amounts of memory regardless of how much
RAM is installed (64 MB is the most one popular chipset can
cache).  Over 64 MB of memory will require
a boot-time parameter with kernels 2.0.35 and earlier, as the
BIOS was originally designed to be unable to report more than
64MB.  Recent 2.1.x kernels and later are able to detect more
memory in a system.
<P>
<DT><B>Data storage:</B><DD><P>Generic AT drives (EIDE, IDE, 16 bit HD
controllers with MFM or RLL, or ESDI) are supported, as are
SCSI hard disks and CD-ROMs, with a supported SCSI adaptor.
Generic XT controllers (8 bit controllers with MFM or RLL) are
also supported.  Supported SCSI adaptors: Advansys, Adaptec 1542, 1522,
1740, 27xx, and 29xx (with some exceptions) series, Buslogic MultiMaster
and Flashpoint, NCR53c8xx-based
controllers, DPT controllers, Qlogic ISP and FAS controllers,
Seagate ST-01 and ST-02, Future Domain TMC-88x
series (or any board based on the TMC950 chip) and
TMC1660/1680, Ultrastor 14F, 24F and 34F, Western Digital
wd7000, and others.  SCSI, QIC-02, and some QIC-80 tapes are
also supported.  Besides IDE and SCSU cdroms, several proprietary
CD-ROM devices are also supported,
including Matsushita/Panasonic, Mitsumi, Sony, Soundblaster,
Toshiba, ATAPI (EIDE), SCSI, and others.  For exact models, check the hardware
compatibility HOWTO.  <B>N.B.</B> These lists are incomplete, and
always will be.  Distribution vendors maintain more up-to-date lists.
<P>
<DT><B>Video:</B><DD><P>VGA, EGA, CGA, or Hercules (and compatibles) work
in text mode.  For graphics and X, there is support for (at
least) normal VGA, some super-VGA cards (most of the cards
based on Tseng, Paradise, and some Trident chipsets),
S3, 8514/A, ATI, Matrox, and Hercules.  (Linux uses
the XFree86 X server, so that determines what cards are
supported.  A full list of supported chipsets alone takes over
a page.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.XFree86.org/">http://www.XFree86.org/</A>)
<P>
<DT><B>Networking:</B><DD><P>Ethernet support includes 3COM 503/509/579/589/595/905 (501/505/507 are
supported but not recomended), AT&amp;T GIS (ne&eacute; NCR) WaveLAN, most
WD8390-based cards, most WD80x3-based cards, NE1000/2000 and most clones,
AC3200, Apricot 82596, AT1700, ATP, DE425/434/435/500, D-Link DE-600/620,
DEPCA, DE100/101, DE200/201/202 Turbo, DE210, DE422, Cabletron E2100
(not recommended), Intel EtherExpress (not recommended), EtherExpress Pro,
EtherExpress 100, DEC EtherWORKS
3, HP LAN, HP PCLAN/plus, most AMD LANCE-based cards, NI5210, ni6510,
SMC Ultra, DEC 21040 (tulip), Zenith Z-Note ethernet, All Zircom cards
and all Cabletron cards other than the E2100 are unsupported, due to
the manufacturers unwillingness to release programming information freely.
<P>FDDI support currently includes the DEF<I>xx</I> cards from
DEC.
<P>Point-to-Point networking support include PPP, SLIP, CSLIP, and PLIP.
PPP support is available for both standard asyncronous devices like
modems, and syncronous connections like ISDN.
<P>Limited Token Ring support is available.
<P>
<DT><B>Serial:</B><DD><P>Most 16450 and 16550 UART-based boards, including
AST Fourport, the Usenet Serial Card II, and others.
Intelligent boards supported include Cyclades
Cyclom series (supported by the manufacturer), Comtrol
Rocketport series (supported by the manufacturer), Stallion
(most boards; supported by the manufacturer), and Digi (some
boards; supported by the manufacturer).  Some ISDN, frame
relay, and leased line hardware is supported.
<P>
<DT><B>Other hardware:</B><DD><P>SoundBlaster, ProAudio Spectrum 16,
Gravis Ultrasound, most other sound cards, most (all?)
flavours of bus mice (Microsoft, Logitech, PS/2), etc.
