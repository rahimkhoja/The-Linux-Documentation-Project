>"Each mobile node is always identified by its home
    address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the
    Internet. While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also
    associated with a care-of address, which provides information
    about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed
    to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its
    care-of address via the mobile nodes Home Agent (HA).  The
    protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile
    node's home address with its care-of address, and then to send any
    packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this
    care-of address."</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Without specific support for mobility in IPv6, packets destined to a
    mobile node (host or router) would not be able to reach it while the
    mobile node is away  from its home link (the link on which its home
    IPv6 subnet prefix is in use), since routing is based on the subnet
    prefix in a packet's destination IP address.  In order to continue
    communication in spite of its movement, a mobile node could change its
    IP address each time it moves to a new link, but the mobile node would
    then not be able to maintain transport and higher-layer connections
    when it changes location.  Mobility support in IPv6 is particularly
    important, as mobile computers are likely to account for a majority or
    at least a substantial fraction of the population of the Internet
    during the lifetime of IPv6."</SPAN
