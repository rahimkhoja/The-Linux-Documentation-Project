>2. An Overview of Power Protection</H1
><P
>Power protection guards your equipment against blackouts,
brownouts, surges, and spikes.  All these events are anomalies in the flow 
of mains power that can damage your electronic equipment.</P
><P
>A <EM
>blackout</EM
> is a complete interruption of
power; some literature considers a voltage drop below about 80V to be a
blackout as well since most equipment will not operate below that
level.</P
><P
>A <EM
>dropout</EM
> is a very short (less than one second)
blackout.</P
><P
>A <EM
>brownout</EM
> or <EM
>sag</EM
> is a
decrease in voltage levels which can last for periods ranging from
fractions of a second to hours. This can be caused by heavy equipment coming on
line such as shop tools, elevators, compressors etc. Also occurs when
utility companies deliberately do this to cope with peak load times.</P
><P
>A <EM
>spike</EM
> is a tremendous increase in voltage over
a very short period of time often caused by a direct lightning strike on a
power line or when power returns after a blackout.</P
><P
>A <EM
>surge</EM
> is a substantial increase in voltage
lasting a small fraction of a second, often caused when high powered
appliances such as air conditioners are switched off.</P
><P
>There are three levels of power protection available to the
home computer user.  The levels are:</P

>While this HOWTO mainly focuses on UPSs, we'll start with some basics
about the other two kinds of power filtering to help you understand where
UPSes fit in.  This is useful even though plummeting UPS prices have made
the low-end alternatives less interesting than they used to be.</P

>2.1. Surge suppressors</H2
><P
>These are basically a fancy fuse between the source and your
hardware; they clamp down spikes, but can't fill in a low voltage
level or dropout.</P
><P
>This is a bare minimum level of protection that any piece of
expensive electronics should have.  Note that this applies to more
than just AC power; surge suppressors are available for (and should be
used on) phone lines, and RS-232 and parallel connections (for use on
long lines; generally not needed if the devices are colocated with the
computer and all devices are protected from outside sources).  Note
also that <EM
>all</EM
> devices connected to your computer
need to be protected; if you put a surge suppressor on your computer
but not your printer, then a zap on the printer may take out the
computer, too.</P
><P
>An important fact about surge suppressors is that <EM
>they
need to be replaced if they absorb a large surge</EM
>.  Besides
fuses, most suppressors rely on on components called Metal-Oxide
Varistors (or MOVs) for spike suppression, which degrade when they
take a voltage hit.  The problem with cheap suppressors is that they
don't tell you when the MOV is cooked, so you can end up with no spike
protection and a false sense of security. Better ones have an
indicator.</P
><P
>You can buy surge suppressors at any Radio Shack; for better prices, go
mail-order through Computer Shopper or some similar magazine.  All of
these are low-cost devices ($10-50).</P

NAME="conditioners"
></A
>2.2. Line Conditioners</H2
><P
>These devices filter noise out of AC lines.  Noise can degrade
your power supply and cause it to fail prematurely.  They also protect
against short voltage dropouts and include surge suppression.</P
><P
>The Tripp-Lite 1200 I used to have was typical of the better class of
line conditioners; a box with a good big soft-iron transformer and a couple
of moby capacitors in it and <EM
>no</EM
> conductive path
between the in and out sides.  With one of these, you can laugh at
brownouts and electrical storms.  A fringe benefit is that if you
accidentally pull your plug out of the wall you may find you actually have
time to re-connect it before the machine notices (I did this once).  But a
true UPS is better.</P
><P
>Netter Trey McLendon has good things to say about Zero Surge
conditioners.  He says: "Our systems at work [...]  have been protected for
2.5 years now through many a violent storm...one strike knocked [out] the
MOV-type suppressors on a Mac dealer's training setup across the street
from us.  The Zero Surge just sort of buzzed when the surge came in, with
no interruption whatsoever.  The basic principle is this: ZS units slow
down the surge with a network of passive elements and then sends it back
out the neutral line, which is tied to ground <EM
>outside at the
box</EM
> by code.  MOV units shunt the surge to ground <EM
>at
the computer</EM
>, where it leaps across serial ports, network
connections, etc. doing its deadly work."</P
><P
>Price vary widely, from $40-400, depending on the power rating
and capabilities of the device.  Mail-order from a reputable supply
house is your best bet.  Line conditioners typically
<EM
>don't</EM
> need to be replaced after a surge; check to
see if yours includes MOVs.</P

>2.3. Uninterruptible Power Supplies</H2
><P
>The remainder of this document will focus on UPSes. A UPS does three
things for you.  First, it filters the power your machine sees, smoothing
out spikes and voltage fluctuations that can stress or even damage your
electronics.  Secondly, it provides a certain amount of dwell time in the
event your power goes out entirely &#8212; this can often get you through
brownouts and short blackouts. Third, when the UPS is about to run out of
power it can arrange a graceful shutdown of your computer so that no
unpleasant things happen to your disk filesystems.  While the risks of
unexpected shutdown are much lessened in these days of journalling
filesystems like Linux's EXT3 or JFS from what they once were, ensuring a
clean shutdown is still a valuable contribution to any system
administrator's peace of mind.</P

>Many pronounce UPS as "ups", but most of the literature seems to
favor "you pee ess", since they use "a UPS" instead of "an UPS". This
document will try to follow the literature. Neither pronunciation will get
you laughed at by those who are experienced in the field.</P
