>To test your UPS, throw the circuit breaker with the UPS on it to
simulate and outage and see how the transition goes. Note that in general
testing an UPS by pulling the plug from the wall is not a good
idea. Electronics like to always have a good ground reference. If you
unplug a UPS, it's still powered but now has what electricians call a
"floating ground". Not only can this be bad for electronics, but it can be
quite dangerous as well. It is likely that unplugging just about any UPS
for a short amount of time isn't likely to result in disaster (don't take
our word for it, though!), but in all cases, throwing a circuit breaker
would be a better thing to do.</P

>It might be useful to install a GFI (Ground Fault Interrupter) on your
UPS-covered outlets to facilitate this testing without having to throw a
breaker, especially if you don't have your UPS protected machines on an
isolated circuit (which you probably should). These are the sockets found
in most modern kitchens and bathrooms with a red and a black button. You
push the latter to cut power and the former to restore power.</P
