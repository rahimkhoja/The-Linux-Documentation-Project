<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Creating our own front end </A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Our Aim </A>
</H2>

<P>We are going to develop a small new language with the 
following constructs - assignments, variable declarations, if and 
while statements etc. We are not going to directly compile our
program but we are making the GCC to do the required operations
and produce the machine code. Let's have a name to our language.
I have given the name "demo", since it shows how to develop a new
compiler. The syntax I am going to choose is a combination
of Pascal and C so that it would be familiar to programmers
of both the languages.
<P>Our role is to clearly specify the syntax of our language
and create a 
tree structure for the language. We will be creating the RTL from
the tree structure. After that, it is the duty of the back end to
produce an optimized output. We will be concentrating only on the
tree structure creation and rtl conversion.
<P>A number of functions and macros for handling the trees and
rtl will be specified. Also a short description of what each does
is  given. The language that is being explained deals with
only integer values so that we can avoid unnecessary type 
conversion complications.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Expressions </A>
</H2>

<P>Let me start our language with the basic unit, expression.
Here we have to perform only tree structure creation. It is possible
with the help of a function called 'build'.
<P>build(PLUS_EXPR, type, left, right)  returns a tree for addition 
operation. Here left and right are two trees supplied by us for
addition. We have one and only one type - the integer type. So 
there is no confusion regarding that.
<P>Similarly, we have build1 used for operations like negations as shown
<P>build1(NEGATE_EXPR,type,expression) where expression is the tree
to be negated. It is used in case of unary operators.
<P>And at last we can create a tree for simple whole numbers as shown
<P>build_int_2(int num, num >=0 ? 0 : -1) to create a tree for the 
specific number. Actually, the two parameters passed are the low 
and high values of type HOST_WIDE_INT. But let us understand it
like this - We have to set the second parameter of the function
to show the correct sign. This is actually a macro invoking
the function build_int_2_wide.
<P>Now we have an idea regarding the creation of trees for building
expressions. Let us directly write the parsing segment for tree
creation for expressions.
<P>
<PRE>
exp:  NUM     { $$ = build_int_2 ($1, $1 >= 0 ? 0 : -1); }
     | exp '+' exp  { $$ = build (PLUS_EXPR, integer_type_node, $1, $3); }
     | exp '-' exp  { $$ = build (MINUS_EXPR, integer_type_node, $1, $3); }
     | exp '*' exp  { $$ = build (MULT_EXPR, integer_type_node, $1, $3); }
     | exp '/' exp  { $$ = build (TRUNC_DIV_EXPR, integer_type_node, $1, $3); }
     | exp '%' exp  { $$ = build (TRUNC_MOD_EXPR, integer_type_node, $1, $3); }
     | '-' exp %prec NEG { $$ = build1 (NEGATE_EXPR, integer_type_node, $2); }
     | '(' exp ')'  { $$ = $2; }
</PRE>
<P>Now I am directly giving the lexical file required by demo language.
No explanation is provided because of its simplicity.

<P>I will be developing our "demo" language in a step by step 
procedure. Starting from expressions we will move steadily to 
the end. At each stage a new construct will be introduced in
the language. So in the final stage the "demo" language obeys
the above grammar in all respect.
<P>In the bison code above, I haven't provided the 
semantic actions for the productions. 
It will be introduced as we are studying to
develop trees and rtl conversion. 
<P>Also in each stage I will be providing you only the

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Functions </A>
</H2>

<P>Let us insert our expression inside a function. A large 
number of steps have to be invoked for a function. It ranges from
setting up the parameters to the announcement of our declaration.
The required tree and rtl functions are described in a step by 
step manner
below. Most of the functions dealing with trees start with a 'build'
and will be returning a tree structure. (I haven't explicitly 
given this fact everywhere. You should understand it by the way
the functions involving trees are used.)
We are going to build the tree using the functions provided by the
GCC. Using the tree structure we will be creating the rtls.
<P>For the functions provided by the GCC, the arguments are 
explained only if it is of any relative importance.
<P> Let us write the routine for function handling.
The given code builds a function with name, "name".

in the function. Suppose, we have "hello(int a, int b)" then a and
b form the parameters. a and b have to be made available to the

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Variable Declaration </A>
</H2>

<P>What is our current status? We have with us a function and
an expression, which is good for nothing. Our language will be
more beautiful with the presence of variables, which can be assigned 
and returned.
<P>So the next step is to declare variables. As usual we have
to build trees and convert it to rtl. When we are making a 
variable declaration as 
<P>
<PRE>
var a;    // I prefer PASCAL syntax. Just a matter of taste.
</PRE>
<P>we have to store the value of 'a' because when it
is used later in an expression, say a+1, we have to use the
same 'a'.
<P>We can define two arrays of our own var_name[ ] and 
var_decls[ ] as shown.
<PRE>

char *var_name[100];    //global array ie. initialized to zero.
tree var_decls[100];    //global array
</PRE>
<P>I hope the reader has understood that the first one is
used to store the name of variables in "demo" and the second one
to store the corresponding tree structures that are built.
<P>Let's directly look at the code.
<PRE>

void add_var(char *name)
{
  int i;
/*Add the name given, as the last name in the array */
  for(i=0;var_name[i];i++);
/* Store the name */
  var_name[i] = name;
/*Build the tree structure for the variable declared 
All the parameters are explained before.
Thus we have name of the variable stored in var_name[] and
tree stored in var_decls[ ]*/
  var_decls[i] =
  build_decl (VAR_DECL, get_identifier(name), integer_type_node);
/* Explained before*/
  DECL_CONTEXT (var_decls[i]) = fndecl;
/*We are just making the initial value of the variable declared 
as zero. This is a matter of taste. */
  DECL_INITIAL (var_decls[i]) = integer_zero_node;
/*push to the current scope. Explained before*/
  pushdecl (var_decls[i]);
/* Emit the rtl for the variable declaration*/
  expand_decl (var_decls[i]);
/* Emit the rtl for the initialization. ie. Initialized to zero*/
  expand_decl_init (var_decls[i]);
}
</PRE>
<P>From now onwards I am not going to give the bison file fully.
I'll be providing only the segments modified by us in each stage.
Please do refer the bison file provided above in case of any
doubt.
<P>The bison segment for variable declaration is given by
<PRE>
declarations:    /*empty */     
              |  declarations VAR NAME          { add_var($3); };
</PRE>
<P>Combining the variable declaration with the above syntax
for functions and expressions, we have another example of a "demo"
program.
<H3>Example demo program 2</H3>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Assignments </A>
</H2>

<P>A number of variables and expressions one below the 
other doesn't help us in any way to do anything useful. For that
we need assignments. Let's study the tree structure building and
rtl conversion for assignments. 
<P>The general format of an assignment statement is "a = 10".
Operations required for it is to store the value, 10 in 'a'. We 
had created the tree structure for 'a' and stored it in
var_decls[] at the time of variable declaration. So our duty
is to retrieve the tree structure of 'a' and assign the value, say 10
in it. 
<P>We seek the help of a function called "get_var" to retrieve
the tree structure of the variable. The code is given below
<PRE>

tree get_var(char *name)
{
  int i;
/*Search for the name "name" in the variable name table, var_name[]
  for(i=0;var_name[i];i++)
/*If found, return the corresponding tree structure of "name"
     if( !strcmp (var_name[i], name))
        return var_decls[i];
}
</PRE>
<P>The above function gets us the tree structure of the variable.
The only task left is to build the tree structure for assignment and
the rtl conversion. It is achieved by the following function.
<PRE>

make_assign (tree vartree, tree valtree)
{
  tree assign;

/* Create the tree. Explained before.
  assign = 
     build (MODIFY_EXPR, integer_type_node, vartree, valtree);

/*Non zero values means that there is a side effect and re evaluation
  of the whole expression could produce a different value. The 
  optimization phase takes this into consideration.
*/      
  TREE_SIDE_EFFECTS (assign) = 1;

/* Indicates that the tree node is used */
  TREE_USED (assign) = 1;

/* Emit the rtl for the assign tree */
  expand_expr_stmt (assign);
}
</PRE>
        
<P>We have also studied the tree creation and rtl conversion
for assignment construct. Now it is time to give the semantic
action in the bison file for assignment.
<PRE>

assignstmt:     NAME = exp      { make_assign ( get_var($1), $3); };
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Expressions revisited </A>
</H2>

<P>The expressions that we are using now is capable of 
working with numbers only. ie. We can give expressions as "1+2", 
"1+2*3" etc. But it is not possible for us to work with variable
names as "a+1", "b+a-5" etc.
<P>Let us modify our expressions to include variable names 
also. The task of inclusion is simple. We have to get the tree
structure of the variable name. We have a function "get_var"  
in our hand which is capable of doing it. 
<P>So let us look at the semantic action for this

inclusion of return construct.

when I explained the 'function'. But at that time we returned only
zero. Now let us return an expression in the place of zero.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8 Conditional statement </A>
</H2>

<P>In the case of 'if' construct our task is different from the 
above. We have to clearly give information to GCC regarding where
the if construct begins, where the 'else' part begins and where
the if construct ends.
<P>GCC supplies us rtl statements, which are capable of 
performing the above tasks. The rtl statements are given below
<PRE>
 

expand_start_cond (tree cond, int exitflag)
</PRE>
<P>It generates an rtl for the start of an if-then. 'cond' is the 
expression whose truth is to be checked. Consider exitflag to be
zero.
<PRE>

expand_start_else ()
expand_end_cond ()
</PRE>
<P>These causes the rtl code generation for start of 'else' and
for the end of 'if construct' respectively.
<P>Now we can use the above functions in our bison file.
<P>
<PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.9">7.9 Loops </A>
</H2>

<P>Loops are same as conditional statements. We have to provide
the start of the loop, end of the loop and the expression to be 
checked for truthness.
<P>The rtl statements meant for the above operations are
<PRE>

struct nesting *expand_start_loop (int exit_flag)
expand_exit_loop_if_false (struct nesting *whichloop, tree cond)
expand_end_loop()
</PRE>
<P>The first one denotes the rtl for start of a loop. 'exit_flag'
is zero.  The return type is struct nesting *, which is used in the
second statement. The second statement is used for generating a conditional
jump to exit the current loop, if 'cond' evaluates to zero. The third
statement is the rtl for end of a loop. It generates a jump back to
the top of the loop. The ideas will be clearer with the bison file.
