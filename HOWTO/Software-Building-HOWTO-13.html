Bullwinkle: Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.
Rocky:      But that trick never works.
Bullwinkle: This time for sure.
            Presto!
            Well, I'm gettin' close.
Rocky:      And now it's time for another special feature.

<P>XmDipmon is a nifty little application that displays a button showing the
status of an Internet connection. It flashes and beeps when the connection
is broken, as is all too often the case in on rural telephone systems.
Unfortunately, XmDipmon works only with <EM>dip</EM>, making it useless
for those people, the majority, who use <EM>chat</EM> to connect.
<P>Building XmDipmon is not a problem.  XmDipmon links to the <EM>Motif</EM>
libraries, but it builds and works fine with <EM>Lesstif</EM>. The
challenge is to alter the package to work when using <EM>chat</EM>. This
involves actually tinkering with the source code, and necessarily requires
some programming knowledge.

        "When xmdipmon starts up, it checks for a file called /etc/dip.pid
         (you can let it look at another file by using the -pidfile
         command line option).  This file contains the PID of the dip
         deamon (dip switches itself into deamon mode once it has
         established a connection)."

<P>Using the <EM>-pidfile</EM> option, the program can be directed to
check for a different file upon startup, one that exists only during
a successful <EM>chat</EM> login.  The obvious candidate is the modem
lock file. We could therefore try invoking the program with <B>xmdipmon
-pidfile /var/lock/LCK..ttyS3</B> (this assumes that the modem is on
com port #4, ttyS3). This only solves part of the problem, however. The
program continually monitors the <EM>dip daemon</EM>, and we need to
change this so it instead polls a process associated with <EM>chat</EM>
or <EM>ppp</EM>.
<P>There is only a single source file, and fortunately it is
well-commented. Scanning the <CODE>xmdipmon.c</CODE> file, we find the
<EM>getProcFile</EM> function, whose header description reads as follows.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/*****
* Name:                 getProcFile
* Return Type:  Boolean
* Description:  tries to open the /proc entry as read from the dip pid file.

<P>We are hot on the trail now. Tracing into the body of the function...

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

                        /* we watch the status of the real dip deamon */
                        sprintf(buf, "/proc/%i/status", pid);
                        procfile = (String)XtMalloc(strlen(buf)*sizeof(char)+1);
                        strcpy(procfile, buf);
                        procfile[strlen(buf)] = '\0';

<P>The culprit is line 2383:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                        sprintf(buf, "/proc/%i/status", pid);
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<P>This checks whether the dip daemon process is running . So, how can we
change this to monitor the pppd daemon instead?
<P>Looking at the <EM>pppd</EM> manpage:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
FILES
       /var/run/pppn.pid (BSD or Linux), /etc/ppp/pppn.pid (others)
                     Process-ID for pppd process on ppp interface unit n.

<P>Change line 2383 in <CODE>xmdipmon.c</CODE> to:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                        sprintf(buf, "/var/run/ppp0.pid" );
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Rebuild the revised package. No problems with the build. Now test it
with the new command line argument. It works like a charm. The little
blue button indicates when a <CODE>ppp</CODE> connection to the ISP has
been established, and flashes and beeps when the connection is broken.
Now we have a fully functional <EM>chat</EM> monitor.
