>1. Introduction</A
></H1
><P
>This document has a very specific purpose; to help people who are failing to 
get X working on Intel's i810 graphics chipset (hereafter "the i810"). It is 
written by a beginner (me), and it is imagined that it will be of use 
primarily to other beginners. The author would be flattered to hear that he 
has helped anyone more skilled than he. Furthermore, I know that the i810 
works with XFree86 3.3.6, but I personally have not trod that path. My 
experience comes purely from XFree86 4.0 (hereafter "X4.x") and the 
i810/agpgart support available in the 2.2.18 and 2.4.x kernels, and 
consequently this HOWTO tackles that solution, or procedure, alone. The 
instructions that follow were written to the 2.4.x compile tune, but the 
procedure is similar enough to be translatable to the 2.2.18. Use your head, as 
Tony Buzan would say, and read the READMEs to be sure of any required alterations
of method.</P
><P
>Even though I know this procedure works I feel obliged to point out that what 
I have recorded here is mostly that which I have worked out in my own bumbling 
way. It may well be that others know a quicker and more efficient method than 
that which follows. If so I will be happy to hear from them. As I mentioned 
previously, the i810 will work with XFree86 3.3.6, if one also uses some 
drivers designed by Intel for the task (namely XFCom_i810-1.2-3 and 
I810Gtt-0.2-4) but, in the interests of Linux purity, and of course knowing 
one does not have to use Intel's software, I recommend the method detailed 
here. It does not need Intel drivers.</P
><P
>Finally, no introduction would be complete without the following words of 
caution; this HOWTO should be regarded as a 'bare bones' set of 
instructions and should therefore be followed with all relevant README 
literature to hand. What follows is not exhaustive by any stretch of the 
imagination, and needs, at least for beginners, said README stuff.</P
