></H2
><P
>You can get either kernel from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.com"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.kernel.com</A

course, read everything called README while you are at it. (In the README 
literature that comes with the 2.4.x kernel, there is an important note about 
where to unpack the source. Make sure you read it.) Put the kernel source file 
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/kernels</TT
>, and 
then run the following compile sequence, which I learned from a linuxnewbie 
article (to which you should refer if my directions are not clear enough for 
you, however it is specific to 2.2.x kernels). It can be found at the following address; <A
HREF="http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nfh/intel/compiling/kernel_update.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nfh/intel/compiling/kernel_update.html</A

Of course, the location of the still-packed kernel is not really relevant, it 
only matters that it is unpacked to an acceptable location. OK, now for the 
commands:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>tar -xzvf /usr/src/kernels/linux-2.4.x.tar.gz</B

mention it in such an imperfect fashion but there is also something like 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make oldconfig</B
> but I can't find any reference to it in my 
books. In any case I am not addressing it here, though I am sure the procedure 
for it is very similar to that which follows for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

menuconfig</B

><P
>Now, I have gone through three text based kernel compiles (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make

CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
menuconfig</B
> instead, which requires only that ncurses be loaded (you 
don't need X) and you will be taken through the pretty face of kernel 
recompilation. I loaded ncurses during a custom install of Red Hat 6.1, but I 
forget exactly at which stage that option is available. Otherwise ncurses is, 
I'm sure, on your distro's CD in rpm format, so if issuing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
menuconfig</B

again.</P

section of the HOWTO after I have tested it. I recommend the static mode here 
because I ran this procedure on a test version of the 2.4.x kernel and it was 
suggested to me that loading statically was a safer and stabler way to go. Now 
that 2.4.x is officially out there, perhaps modules will be more sensible. 
I'll let you know how it goes. (Thanks to Heron Ordonez for this.))</P

while <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

you want to play it that way. Essentially, minimalistically, you can have 
one kernel called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vmlinuz</TT

and name all the others by their version number (or just trash them!), and swap  
all the names around when you want to boot another kernel. Or give each kernel a unique

new kernel and with fingers crossed, watch. It should work. If it does, go and 
celebrate a little. But don't let it get to your head because you have yet to 
mknod the agpgart module, a simple yet essential procedure done thusly:

>This is a kind of a p.s. to this section but may be helpful. I had a wee 
problem when going through the XF86Config part of this HOWTO during a test 
run. It stemmed from having read but not fully understood some blurb about the 
i810 and X4.x not working at all resolutions with a buffer extension (or 
something like that). Anyway, I made no notes about this and cannot therefore 
remember exactly what I read. Because I remember this vaguely I can only say 
the following with certainty; you need the following stanza at the beginning 
of your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> file:

module</TT

extension</TT
