<LI><B>Q</B>:
I've created a RAID-0 device on <CODE>/dev/sda2</CODE> and 
<CODE>/dev/sda3</CODE>. The device is a lot slower than a 
single partition. Isn't md a pile of junk?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
To have a RAID-0 device running a full speed, you must 
have partitions from different disks.  Besides, putting 
the two halves of the mirror on the same disk fails to 
give you any protection whatsoever against disk failure.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
What's the use of having RAID-linear when RAID-0 will do the 
same thing, but provide higher performance?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
It's not obvious that RAID-0 will always provide better 
performance; in fact, in some cases, it could make things 
worse.
The ext2fs file system scatters files all over a partition,
and it attempts to keep all of the blocks of a file
contiguous, basically in an attempt to prevent fragmentation.  
Thus, ext2fs behaves "as if" there were a (variable-sized) 
stripe per file.  If there are several disks concatenated
into a single RAID-linear, this will result files being
statistically distributed on each of the disks.  Thus,
at least for ext2fs, RAID-linear will behave a lot like
RAID-0 with large stripe sizes.  Conversely, RAID-0 
with small stripe sizes can cause excessive disk activity
leading to severely degraded performance if several large files
are accessed simultaneously.  
<P>In many cases, RAID-0 can be an obvious win. For example,
imagine a large database file.  Since ext2fs attempts to
cluster together all of the blocks of a file, chances 
are good that it will end up on only one drive if RAID-linear
is used, but will get chopped into lots of stripes if RAID-0 is
used.  Now imagine a number of (kernel) threads all trying
to random access to this database.  Under RAID-linear, all
accesses would go to one disk, which would not be as efficient
as the parallel accesses that RAID-0 entails.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
How does RAID-0 handle a situation where the different stripe 
partitions are different sizes?  Are the stripes uniformly
distributed?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
To understand this, lets look at an example with three
partitions; one that is 50MB, one 90MB and one 125MB.

Lets call D0 the 50MB disk, D1 the 90MB disk and D2 the 125MB
disk.  When you start the device, the driver calculates 'strip
zones'.  In this case, it finds 3 zones, defined like this:

<PRE>
            Z0 : (D0/D1/D2) 3 x 50 = 150MB  total in this zone
            Z1 : (D1/D2)  2 x 40 = 80MB total in this zone
            Z2 : (D2) 125-50-40 = 35MB total in this zone.
            
</PRE>


You can see that the total size of the zones is the size of the
virtual device, but, depending on the zone, the striping is
different.  Z2 is rather inefficient, since there's only one
disk.

Since <CODE>ext2fs</CODE> and most other Unix  
file systems distribute files all over the disk, you
have a  35/265 = 13% chance that a fill will end up
on Z2, and not get any of the benefits of striping.
           
(DOS tries to fill a disk from beginning to end, and thus,
the oldest files would end up on Z0.  However, this
strategy leads to severe filesystem fragmentation,
which is why no one besides DOS does it this way.)

The answer depends on the configuration that you use.

other factors.   In a system with low I/O usage,
the performance is equal to that of a single disk.

In a low-I/O situation, this won't change performance
at all: you will have to wait for one disk to complete 
the read.
But, with two disks in a high-I/O environment,
this could as much as double the read performance,
since reads can be issued to each of the disks in parallel.
For N disks in the mirror, this could improve performance
N-fold.

as the read performance of a mirrored array.
<P>
<DT><B>Linux MD RAID-4/5 write performance:</B><DD><P>This will in general be considerably slower than that for
a single disk.  This is because the parity must be written

in order to compute the new parity, the old parity and 
the old data must be read first. The old data, new data and
old parity must all be XOR'ed together to determine the new
parity: this requires considerable CPU cycles in addition
to the numerous disk accesses.

<LI><B>Q</B>:
What is the optimal RAID-5 configuration for performance?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Since RAID-5 experiences an I/O load that is equally 
distributed 
across several drives, the best performance will be 
obtained when the RAID set is balanced by using 
identical drives, identical controllers,  and the
same (low) number of drives on each controller.

Note, however, that using identical components will
raise the probability of multiple simultaneous failures,
for example due to a sudden jolt or drop, overheating,
or a power surge during an electrical storm. Mixing
brands and models helps reduce this risk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
What is the optimal block size for a RAID-4/5 array?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
When using the current (November 1997) RAID-4/5
implementation, it is strongly recommended that
the file system be created with <CODE>mke2fs -b 4096</CODE>
instead of the default 1024 byte filesystem block size.

<P>This is because the current RAID-5 implementation 
allocates one 4K memory page per disk block; 
if a disk block were just 1K in size, then 
75% of the memory which RAID-5 is allocating for 
pending I/O would not be used.  If the disk block 
size matches the memory page size, then the 
driver can (potentially) use all of the page. 
Thus, for a filesystem with a 4096 block size as
opposed to a 1024 byte block size, the RAID driver 
will potentially queue 4 times as much 
pending I/O to the low level drivers without 
allocating additional memory.
<P>
<P><B>Note</B>: the above remarks do NOT apply to Software 
RAID-0/1/linear driver.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B> the statements about 4K memory page size apply to the 
Intel x86 architecture.   The page size on Alpha, Sparc, and other 
CPUS are different; I believe they're 8K on Alpha/Sparc (????).
Adjust the above figures accordingly.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B> if your file system has a lot of small
files (files less than 10KBytes in size), a considerable
fraction of the disk space might be wasted.  This is 
because the file system allocates disk space in multiples 
of the block size.  Allocating large blocks for small files 
clearly results in a waste of disk space: thus, you may
want to stick to small block sizes, get a larger effective
storage capacity, and not worry about the "wasted" memory
due to the block-size/page-size mismatch.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B> most ''typical'' systems do not have that many
small files.  That is, although there might be thousands
of small files, this would lead to only some 10 to 100MB
wasted space, which is probably an acceptable tradeoff for
performance on a multi-gigabyte disk.
<P>However, for news servers, there might be tens or hundreds
of thousands of small files.  In such cases, the smaller
block size, and thus the improved storage capacity, 
may be more important than the more efficient I/O 
scheduling.
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B> there exists an experimental file system for Linux
which packs small files and file chunks onto a single block.
It apparently has some very positive performance
implications when the average file size is much smaller than
the block size.
<P>
<P>Note: Future versions may implement schemes that obsolete
the above discussion. However, this is difficult to
implement, since dynamic run-time allocation can lead to
dead-locks; the current implementation performs a static
pre-allocation.

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
How does the chunk size (stripe size) influence the speed of 
my RAID-0, RAID-4 or RAID-5 device?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The chunk size is the amount of data contiguous on the 
virtual device that is also contiguous on the physical 
device.  In this HOWTO, "chunk" and "stripe" refer to 
the same thing: what is commonly called the "stripe" 
in other RAID documentation is called the "chunk" 
in the MD man pages.  Stripes or chunks apply only to
RAID 0, 4 and 5, since stripes are not used in 
mirroring (RAID-1) and simple concatenation (RAID-linear).
The stripe size affects both read and write latency (delay),
throughput (bandwidth), and contention between independent 
operations (ability to simultaneously service overlapping I/O
requests).
<P>Assuming the use of the ext2fs file system, and the current
kernel policies about read-ahead, large stripe sizes are almost 
always better than small stripe sizes, and stripe sizes
from about a fourth to a full disk cylinder in size
may be best.  To understand this claim, let us consider the 
effects of large stripes on small files, and small stripes
on large files.  The stripe size does 
not affect the read performance of small files:  For an
array of N drives, the file has a 1/N probability of 
being entirely within one stripe on any one of the drives. 
Thus, both the read latency and bandwidth will be comparable
to that of a single drive.  Assuming that the small files
are statistically well distributed around the filesystem,
(and, with the ext2fs file system, they should be), roughly
N times more overlapping, concurrent reads should be possible
without significant collision between them.  Conversely, if  
very small stripes are used, and a large file is read sequentially, 
then a read will issued to all of the disks in the array.
For a the read of a single large file, the latency will almost 
double, as the probability of a block being 3/4'ths of a 
revolution or farther away will increase.  Note, however,
the trade-off: the bandwidth could improve almost N-fold 
for reading a single, large file, as N drives can be reading
simultaneously (that is, if read-ahead is used so that all
of the disks are kept active).  But there is another, 
counter-acting trade-off:  if all of the drives are already busy
reading one file, then attempting to read a second or third
file at the same time will cause significant contention,
ruining performance as the disk ladder algorithms lead to
seeks all over the platter.  Thus,  large stripes will almost
always lead to the best performance. The sole exception is
the case where one is streaming a single, large file at a 
time, and one requires the top possible bandwidth, and one 
is also using a good read-ahead algorithm, in which case small
stripes are desired.
<P>
<P>Note that this HOWTO previously recommended small stripe
sizes for news spools or other systems with lots of small
files. This was bad advice, and here's why:  news spools
contain not only many small files, but also large summary
files, as well as large directories.  If the summary file
is larger than the stripe size, reading it will cause 
many disks to be accessed, slowing things down as each
disk performs a seek.  Similarly, the current ext2fs
file system searches directories in a linear, sequential
fashion.  Thus, to find a given file or inode, on average 
half of the directory will be read. If this directory is 
spread across several stripes (several disks), the 
directory read (e.g. due to the ls command) could get 
very slow. Thanks to Steven A. Reisman

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I found that using a 256k stripe gives much better performance. 
I suspect that the optimum size would be the size of a disk 
cylinder (or maybe the size of the disk drive's sector cache).  
However, disks nowadays have recording zones with different 
sector counts (and sector caches vary among different disk 
models).  There's no way to guarantee stripes won't cross a 
cylinder boundary.

What is the correct stride factor to use when creating the

the -R flag on the <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> command:

</PRE>

What should the value of nnn be?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The <CODE>-R stride</CODE> flag is used to tell the file system
about the size of the RAID stripes.  Since only RAID-0,4 and 5
use stripes, and RAID-1 (mirroring) and RAID-linear do not, 
this flag is applicable only for RAID-0,4,5.

Knowledge of the size of a stripe allows <CODE>mke2fs</CODE>
to allocate the block and inode bitmaps so that they don't 
all end up on the same physical drive.  An unknown contributor
wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I noticed last spring that one drive in a pair always had a

When is Software RAID superior to Hardware RAID?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Normally, Hardware RAID is considered superior to Software 
RAID, because hardware controllers often have a large cache,
and can do a better job of scheduling operations in parallel.
However, integrated Software RAID can (and does) gain certain 
advantages from being close to the operating system.

<P>For example, ... ummm. Opaque description of caching of 
reconstructed blocks in buffer cache elided ...
<P>
<P>On a dual PPro SMP system, it has been reported that
Software-RAID performance exceeds the performance of a
well-known hardware-RAID board vendor by a factor of 
2 to 5.
<P>
<P>Software RAID is also a very interesting option for
high-availability redundant server systems.  In such
a configuration, two CPU's are attached to one set
or SCSI disks.  If one server crashes or fails to 
respond, then the other server can <CODE>mdadd</CODE>,
<CODE>mdrun</CODE> and <CODE>mount</CODE> the software RAID
array, and take over operations.  This sort of dual-ended
operation is not always possible with many hardware
RAID controllers, because of the state configuration that
the hardware controllers maintain.

<CODE>SPEED_LIMIT</CODE> is used to limit RAID reconstruction

without first running <CODE>ckraid</CODE>.  Automatic
reconstruction is also used after a failed hard drive

<P>In order to avoid overwhelming the system while
reconstruction is occurring, the reconstruction thread
monitors the reconstruction speed and slows it down if 
its too fast.  The 1M/sec limit was arbitrarily chosen 
as a reasonable rate which allows the reconstruction to
finish reasonably rapidly, while creating only a light load

<LI><B>Q</B>:
I want to maximize performance.  Should I use multiple 
controllers?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
In many cases, the answer is yes.  Using several 
controllers to perform disk access in parallel will 
improve performance.  However, the actual improvement
depends on your actual configuration.  For example,
it has been reported (Vaughan Pratt, January 98) that
a single 4.3GB Cheetah attached to an Adaptec 2940UW 
can achieve a rate of 14MB/sec (without using RAID).  
Installing two disks on one controller, and using 
a RAID-0 configuration results in a measured performance 
of 27 MB/sec.  

<P>Note that the 2940UW controller is an "Ultra-Wide"
SCSI controller, capable of a theoretical burst rate
of 40MB/sec, and so the above measurements are not 
surprising.  However, a slower controller attached
to two fast disks would be the bottleneck.  Note also,
that most out-board SCSI enclosures (e.g. the kind
with hot-pluggable trays) cannot be run at the 40MB/sec 
rate, due to cabling and electrical noise problems.
<P>
<P>If you are designing a multiple controller system,
remember that most disks and controllers typically
run at 70-85% of their rated max speeds.
<P>
<P>Note also that using one controller per disk
can reduce the likelihood of system outage
due to a controller or cable failure (In theory --
only if the device driver for the controller can
gracefully handle a broken controller. Not all 
SCSI device drivers seem to be able to handle such
a situation without panicking or otherwise locking up).
