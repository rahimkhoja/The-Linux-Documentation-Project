<P><B>Where we list some <EM>real</EM> zone files</B>
<P>
<P>Users have suggested that I include a real example of a working
domain as well as the tutorial example.
<P>
<P>I use this example with permission from David Bullock of LAND-5.
These files were current 24th of September 1996, and were then edited
to fit BIND 8 restrictions and use extensions by me.  So, what you see
here differs a bit from what you find if you query LAND-5's name
servers now.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 /etc/named.conf (or /var/named/named.conf)</A>
</H2>

<P>Here we find master zone sections for the two reverse zones needed:
the 127.0.0 net, as well as LAND-5's <CODE>206.6.177</CODE> subnet, and a
primary line for land-5's forward zone <CODE>land-5.com</CODE>. Also note that
instead of stuffing the files in a directory called <CODE>pz</CODE>, as I do
in this HOWTO, he puts them in a directory called <CODE>zone</CODE>.

<P>Just the basics, the obligatory SOA record, and a record that maps
127.0.0.1 to <CODE>localhost</CODE>.  Both are required.  No more should be in
this file.  It will probably never need to be updated, unless your

<P>
<P>If you look at a random BIND installation you will probably find
that the <CODE>$TTL</CODE> line is missing as it is here.  It was not used
before, and only version 8.2 of BIND has started to warn about its
absence.  BIND 9 <EM>requires</EM> the <CODE>$TTL</CODE>.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 /var/named/zone/land-5.com</A>
</H2>

<P>Here we see the mandatory SOA record, the needed NS records.  We
can see that he has a secondary name server at <CODE>ns2.psi.net</CODE>.  This
is as it should be, <EM>always</EM> have a off site secondary server as
backup.  We can also see that he has a master host called <CODE>land-5</CODE>
which takes care of many of the different Internet services, and that
he's done it with CNAMEs (a alternative is using A records).
<P>
<P>As you see from the SOA record, the zone file originates at
<CODE>land-5.com</CODE>, the contact person is
<CODE>root@land-5.com</CODE>. <CODE>hostmaster</CODE> is another oft used address for
the contact person.  The serial number is in the customary yyyymmdd
format with todays serial number appended; this is probably the sixth
version of zone file on the 20th of September 1996.  Remember that the
serial number <EM>must</EM> increase monotonically, here there is only
<EM>one</EM> digit for todays serial#, so after 9 edits he has to wait
until tomorrow before he can edit the file again.  Consider using two
digits.

<P>
<P>If you examine land-5s nameserver you will find that the host names
are of the form <CODE>ws_</CODE><EM>number</EM>.  As of late BIND 4 versions named
started enforcing the restrictions on what characters may be used in
host names.  So that does not work with BIND 8 at all, and I
substituted '-' (dash) for '_' (underline) for use in this HOWTO.
But, as mentioned earlier, BIND 9 no longer enforces this restriction.
<P>
<P>Another thing to note is that the workstations don't have
individual names, but rather a prefix followed by the two last parts
of the IP numbers.  Using such a convention can simplify maintenance
significantly, but can be a bit impersonal, and, in fact, be a source
of irritation among your customers.
<P>
<P>We also see that <CODE>funn.land-5.com</CODE> is an alias for
<CODE>land-5.com</CODE>, but using an A record, not a CNAME record.

<P>
<P>The reverse zone is the bit of the setup that seems to cause the
most grief.  It is used to find the host name if you have the IP
number of a machine.  Example: you are an FTP server and accept
connections from FTP clients.  As you are a Norwegian FTP server you
want to accept more connections from clients in Norway and other
Scandinavian countries and less from the rest of the world.  When you
get a connection from a client the C library is able to tell you the
IP number of the connecting machine because the IP number of the
client is contained in all the packets that are passed over the
network.  Now you can call a function called gethostbyaddr that looks
up the name of a host given the IP number.  Gethostbyaddr will ask a
DNS server, which will then traverse the DNS looking for the machine.
Supposing the client connection is from ws-177200.land-5.com.  The IP
number the C library provides to the FTP server is 206.6.177.200.  To
find out the name of that machine we need to find
<CODE>200.177.6.206.in-addr.arpa</CODE>.  The DNS server will first find the
<CODE>arpa.</CODE> servers, then find <CODE>in-addr.arpa.</CODE> servers, following
the reverse trail through 206, then 6 and at last finding the server
for the <CODE>177.6.206.in-addr.arpa</CODE> zone at LAND-5.  From which it
will finally get the answer that for <CODE>200.177.6.206.in-addr.arpa</CODE>
we have a ``<CODE>PTR ws-177200.land-5.com</CODE>'' record, meaning that the
name that goes with <CODE>206.6.177.200</CODE> is <CODE>ws-177200.land-5.com</CODE>.
<P>
<P>The FTP server prioritizes connections from the Scandinavian
countries, i.e., <CODE>*.no</CODE>, <CODE>*.se</CODE>, <CODE>*.dk</CODE>, the name
<CODE>ws-177200.land-5.com</CODE> clearly does not match any of those, and the
server will put the connection in a connection class with less
bandwidth and fewer clients allowed.  If there was <EM>no</EM> reverse
mapping of <CODE>206.2.177.200</CODE> through the <CODE>in-addr.arpa</CODE> zone the
server would have been unable to find the name at all and would have
to settle to comparing <CODE>206.2.177.200</CODE> with <CODE>*.no</CODE>, <CODE>*.se</CODE>
and <CODE>*.dk</CODE>, none of which will match at all, it may even deny the
connection for lack of classification.
<P>
<P>Some people will tell you that reverse lookup mappings are only
important for servers, or not important at all.  Not so: Many ftp,
news, IRC and even some http (WWW) servers will <EM>not</EM> accept
connections from machines of which they are not able to find the name.
So reverse mappings for machines are in fact <EM>mandatory</EM>.
