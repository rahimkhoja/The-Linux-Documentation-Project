This document describes a setup for nfs over root. This document differs
from the other root over nfs howto's in 2 ways: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>It describes both the server and the client side offering a complete solution,
it doesn't desribe the generic principles off root over nfs although they will
become clear. Instead it offers a working setup for root over nfs. One of the
many possible setup's I might add.</LI>
<LI>This solution is unique in that it shares the root of the server with the
workstations (ws). Instead of having a mini-root per ws. This has a number
of advantages: 
<UL>
<LI>low diskspace usage</LI>
<LI>any changes on the serverside are also automagicly made at the client side,
all configuration has only to be done once!</LI>
<LI>Very easy adding of new clients</LI>
<LI>only one system to maintain</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>This document is heavily based on a RedHat-5.2 system. Quite a bit of prior
linux sysadmin experience is assumed in this howto, if you have that it shouldn't
be a problem to addept this solutions to other distributions.
