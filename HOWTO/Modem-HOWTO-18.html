<P>The error message might also be something like "Modem
not responding".  There are at least 4 possible reasons:
<OL>
<LI> Your modem is a winmodem and no working driver has been
installed for it.  Or the modem is defective or in "online data mode"
where it doesn't respond.  See 
<A HREF="#winmodem_">winmodem_</A>
</LI>
<LI>Your modem is disabled since both the BIOS and Linux failed to
enable it.  It has no IO address.</LI>
<LI>Your modem is enabled and has an IO address but it has no ttyS
device number (like ttyS14) assigned to that address so the modem
can't be used.  </LI>
<LI>You modem does have a ttyS number assigned to it (like ttyS4)
but you are using the wrong ttyS number (like ttyS2 instead of
ttyS4).  See 
<A HREF="#wrong_ttySx">wrong_ttySx</A>
 and/or 
<A HREF="#wvdial_">wvdial</A> and/or 
<A HREF="#minicom_test">minicom (test  modem)</A></LI>
</OL>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="winmodem_"></A> Case 1: Winmodem </H3>

<P>For a winmodem with no driver (or a defective modem) the serial
port that the modem is on can usually be found OK.  But when the
wvdial program (or whatever) interrogates that port, it gets no
response since winmodems need a driver to do anything.  So you see a
message saying that no modem was found.  However, it's likely that the
modem card was detected at boot-time and it displays a message
implying that a modem was found.  So you're told both that the modem
was found and that it wasn't found!  What it all means is that no
working modem has been found, since a modem that doesn't work has been
found.  Of course it could not be working for reasons other than being
a winmodem (or linmodem) with no driver.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-2.html#soft_modem">Software-based Modems (winmodems, linmodems)</A>.</P>

<H3>Cases 2-3</H3>

<P>Cases 2. and 3. mean that no serial port device (such as
/dev/ttyS2) exists for the modem.  If you suspect this, see 
<A HREF="#cant_find_port">Serial Port Can't be Found</A>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="wrong_ttySx"></A> Case 4: Wrong ttySx number </H3>

<P>If you are lucky, the problem is case 4.  Then you just need to find
which ttyS your modem is on. </P>

<H3><A NAME="wvdial_"></A> wvdial </H3>

<P>There's a program that looks for modems on commonly used serial
ports called "wvdialconf".  Just type "wvdialconf
&lt;a-new-file-name&gt;".  It will create the new file as a
configuration file but you don't need this file unless you are going
to use "wvdial" for dialing.  See 
<A HREF="#wvdial_">What is wvdialconf ?</A>  Unfortunately, if your modem is in "online data" mode,
wvdialconf will report "No modem detected".  See 
<A HREF="#minicom_test">minicom (test modem)</A></P>

<H3><A NAME="minicom_test"></A> minicom (test modem) </H3>

<P>Another way try to find out if there's a modem on a certain port is
to start "minicom" on the port (after first setting up minicom for
that serial port.  You will need to save the setup and then exit
minicom and start it again.  Then type "AT" and you should see "OK".
If you don't, try typing ATQ0 V1 EI.  If you still don't get OK (and
likely don't even see the AT you typed) then there is likely no modem
on the port.  This may be due to either case 1. 2. or 3. above</P>
<P>If what you type is really getting thru to a modem, then the lack of
response could be due to the modem being in "online data" mode where
it can't accept any AT commands.  You may have been using the modem
and then abruptly disconnected (such as killing the process with
signal 9).  In that case your modem did not get reset to "command
mode" where it can interact to AT commands.  "Minicom" may display
"You are already online.  Hangup first."  (For another meaning of this
minicom message see 
<A HREF="#already_online">You are already online!  Hang up first.</A>) Well, you are sort of online but you are
may not be connected to anything over the phone line.  Wvdial will
report "modem not responding" for the same situation.</P>
<P>To fix this as a last resort you could reboot the computer.  Another
way to try to fix this is to send +++ to the modem to tell it to
escape back to "command mode" from "online data mode".  On both sides
of the +++ sequence there must be about 1 second of delay (nothing
sent during "guard time").  This may not work if another process is
using the modem since the +++ sequence could wind up with other
characters inserted in between them or after the +++ (during the guard
time).  Ironically, even if the modem line is idle, typing an
unexpected +++ is likely to set off an exchange of control packets
(that you never see) that will violate the required guard time so
that the +++ doesn't do what you wanted.  +++ is usually in the string
that is named "hangup string" so if you command minicom (or the like)
to hangup it might work.  Another way to do this is to just exit
minicom and then run minicom again.</P>
<P>Other problems which you might observe in minicom besides no response
to AT are:
<UL>
<LI> It takes many seconds to get an expected truncated response
(including only the cursor moving down one line).  See 
<A HREF="#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A></LI>
<LI> Some strange characters appear but they are not in response to
AT.  This likely means that your modem is still connected to something
at the other end of the phone line which is sending some cryptic
packets or the like.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.2">18.2</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.2">"Modem is busy"</A>
</H2>

<P> What this means depends on what program sent it.  The modem could
actually be in use (busy).  Another cause reported for the SuSE
distribution is that there may be two serial drivers present instead
of one.  One driver was built into the kernel and the second was a
module.</P>
<P>In kppp, this message is sent when an attempt to get/set the serial
port "stty" parameters fails.  (It's similar to the "Input/output
error" one may get when trying to use "stty -F /dev/ttySx").  To get a
few of these stty parameters, the true address of the port must be
known to the driver.  So the driver may have the wrong address.  The
setserial" command will display what the driver thinks but it's likely
wrong in this case.  So what the "modem busy" often means is that the
serial port (and thus the modem) can't be found.</P>
<P>If you have a pci modem, then use one of these commands: lspci -v, or
cat /proc/pci, or dmesg to find the correct address and irq of the
modem's serial port.  Then check to see if "setserial" shows the same
thing.  If not, you need to run a script at boot-time which contains a
setserial command that will tell the driver the correct address and
irq. </P>

<H2><A NAME="already_online"></A> <A NAME="ss18.3">18.3</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.3">"You are already online!  Hang up first." (from minicom)</A>
</H2>

<P> The modem has its CD signal on.  Either you are actually online
(a remote modem is sending you a carrier) or your modem has been setup
to always send the CD signal.  In minicom, type at&amp;v to see if
&amp;C or &amp;C0 is set.  If so, CD will be on even if you are
offline and you'll erroneously get this error message.  The fix is to
set &amp;C1 in the init string or save it in the modem. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.4">18.4</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.4">I can't get near 56k on my 56k modem</A>
</H2>

<P> There must be very low noise on the line for it to work at even
close to 56k.  Some phone lines are so bad that the speeds obtainable
are much slower than 56k (like 28.8k or even slower).  Sometimes
extension phones connected to the same line can cause problems.  To
test this you might connect your modem directly at the point where the
telephone line enters the building with the feeds for everything else
on that line disconnected (if others can tolerate such a test).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.5">18.5</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.5">Uploading (downloading) files is broken/slow</A>
</H2>

<P> Flow control (both at your PC and/or modem-to-modem) may not be
enabled.  For the uploading case: If you have set a high DTE speed
(like 115.2k) then flow from your modem to your PC may work OK but
uploading flow in the other direction will not all get thru due to the
telephone line bottleneck.  This will result in many errors and the
resending of packets.  It may thus take far too long to send a file.
In some cases, files don't make it thru at all.</P>
<P>For the downloading case: If you're downloading long uncompressed
files or web pages (and your modem uses data compression) or if you've
set a low DTE speed, then downloading may also be broken due to no
flow control.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.6">18.6</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.6">For Dial-in I Keep Getting "line NNN of inittab invalid"</A>
</H2>

<P>Make sure you are using the correct syntax for your version of
<CODE>init</CODE>.  The different <CODE>init</CODE>'s that are out there use different
syntax in the <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> file.  Make sure you are using the
correct syntax for your version of <CODE>getty</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.7">18.7</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.7">I Keep Getting: ``Id "S4" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes''</A>
</H2>

<P> Id "S4" is just an example.  In this case look on the line which
starts with "S4" in <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> and calls getty.  This line
causes the problem.  Make sure the syntax for this line is correct and
that the device (ttyS4) exists and can be found.  If the modem has
negated CD and getty opens the port, you'll get this error message
since negated CD will kill getty.  Then getty will respawn only to be
killed again, etc.  Thus it respawns over and over (too fast).  It
seems that if the cable to the modem is disconnected or you have the
wrong serial port, it's just like CD is negated.  All this can occur
when your modem is chatting with getty.  Make sure your modem is
configured correctly.  Look at AT commands <CODE>E</CODE> and <CODE>Q</CODE>.</P>

<P>If you use uugetty, verify that your <CODE>/etc/gettydefs</CODE> syntax is
correct by doing the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# getty -c /etc/gettydefs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This can also happen when the <CODE>uugetty</CODE> initialization is failing.
See section 
<A HREF="#uu_nowork">uugetty Still Doesn't Work</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.8">18.8</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.8">Dial-in: When remote user hangs up, getty doesn't respawn</A>
</H2>

<P> One possible cause is that your modem doesn't reset right when DTR
is dropped after someone hangs up.  Most Hayes compatible modems do
this OK with <CODE>&amp;D3</CODE>.  But for USR Courier, SupraFax, and some
other modems, you must set <CODE>&amp;D2</CODE> (and <CODE>S13=1</CODE> in some
cases).  Check your modem manual (if you have one).  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-12.html#end_dialin">Ending a Dial-in Call</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.9">18.9</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.9">NO DIALTONE</A>
</H2>

<P>It means exactly what it says.  Someone else may be using another
telephone on the same line.  You also get this error if there is no
phone line plugged into the modem, or if the phone line is somehow
broken.  Try plugging a real telephone into the phone cord used by the
modem.  Check it for a dialtone.</P>
<P>If for some reason your modem doesn't detect a dialtone, then you can
force it to dial anyway by putting X3 in the init string.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.10">18.10</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.10">NO CARRIER</A>
</H2>

<P>This means that the analog sine wave (the carrier) from the other
modem isn't present like it should be.  If you were already connected,
this means that the connection has been lost.  There may have been
noise on the line or a bad connection.  The other modem may have hung
up on you for some reason:   Perhaps the automatic login process
didn't work out OK.  Perhaps PPP didn't get started OK.  Perhaps a
time limit was exceeded.</P>
<P>If you get this error before you get connected, it means that the
carrier of the other modem wasn't detected by your modem.  This may
happen if there is there is no properly working modem on the other
end.  For example, an answering machine could have picked up your
call instead of a modem.  NO CARRIER will also happen if the modems
fail to negotiate a protocol to use.  This can happen if you have an
early V.90 modem that first tries to negotiate a high speed X2 or
K56flex protocol.  These two protocols are obsolete and some ISP
servers will drop the connection (hang up) when this happens since
they have no understanding of such protocols and don't wait around
long enough for the calling modem to fallback to V.90.</P>
<P>If you force your modem to drop the connection by dropping the DTR
signal or sending your modem the hangup signal (ATH) you may get this
error message.  But in this case you (or your software) wanted to drop
the connection so there should be no problem.  In this case you are
only supposed to get NO CARRIER if data was lost.   So for most cases
of dropping a connection by hangup (or by dropping DTR) you only get
an OK message.  Your modem dialer program may not even display that to
you.</P>

<H2><A NAME="cant_find_port"></A> <A NAME="ss18.13">18.13</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.13">Serial Port Can't be Found</A>
</H2>

<P>There are 3 possibilities:
<OL>
<LI>Your port is disabled since both the BIOS and Linux failed to
enable it.  It has no IO address.</LI>
<LI>Your port is enabled and has an IO address but it has no ttyS
device number (like ttyS14) assigned to that address so the port
can't be used.  As a last resort, you may need to use "setserial" to
assign a ttyS number to it.</LI>
<LI>Your port does have a ttyS number assigned to it (like ttyS14)
but you don't know which physical connector it is (on the back of your
PC).

See the Serial_HOWTO: "Which Connector on the Back of
my PC is ttyS1, etc?"  But if you want to find which ttyS port the
modem is on see 
<A HREF="#cant_find_modem">My Modem is Physically There but Can't be Found</A> </LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>First check BIOS messages at boot-time (and possibly the BIOS menu for
the serial port).  Then for the PCI bus type lspci -v.  If this shows
something like "LPC Bridge" then your port is likely on the LPC bus
which is not well supported by Linux yet (but the BIOS might find it)
??  If it's an ISA bus PnP serial port, try "pnpdump --dumpregs"
and/or see Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.  If the port happens to be enabled
then the following two paragraphs may help find the IO port:</P>

<H3>Scanning/probing legacy ports</H3>

<P>This is mainly for legacy non-PCI ports and ISA ports that are not
Plug-and-Play.</P>
<P>Using "scanport" (Debian only ??) will scan all enabled bus ports and
may discover an unknown port that could be a serial port (but it
doesn't probe the port).  It could hang your PC.  If you suspect that
your port may be at a certain address, you may try manually probing
with setserial, but it's a slow tedious task if you have several
addresses to probe.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#probing_ss">Probing</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.14">18.14</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.14">Linux Creates an Interrupt Conflict (your PC has an ISA slot)</A>
</H2>

<P>If your PC has a BIOS that handles ISA (and likely PCI too) then
if you find a IRQ conflict, it might be due to a shortage of free
IRQs.  The BIOS often maintains a list of reserved IRQs, reserved for
legacy ISA cards.  If too many are reserved, the BIOS may not be able
to find a free IRQ and will erroneously assign an IRQ to the serial
port that creates a conflict.  So check to see if all the reserved
IRQs are really needed and if not, unreserve an IRQ that the serial
port can use.  For more details, see Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.</P>

<H2><A NAME="slow_"></A> <A NAME="ss18.15">18.15</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.15">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A>
 </H2>

<P> It's likely mis-set/conflicting interrupts.  Here are some of the
symptoms which will happen the first time you try to use a modem,
terminal, or serial printer.  In some cases you type something but
nothing appears on the screen until many seconds later.  Only the last
character typed may show up.  It may be just an invisible
&lt;return&gt; character so all you notice is that the cursor jumps
down one line.  In other cases where a lot of data should appear on
the screen, only a batch of about 16 characters appear.  Then there is
a long wait of many seconds for the next batch of characters.  You
might also get "input overrun" error messages (or find them in logs).</P>
<P>For more details on the symptoms and why this happens see
the Serial-HOWTO section: "Interrupt Problem Details".</P>
<P>If it involves Plug-and-Play devices, see also Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.</P>
<P>As a quick check to see if it really is an interrupt problem, set the
IRQ to 0 with "setserial".  This will tell the driver to use
polling instead of interrupts.  If this seems to fix the "slow"
problem then you had an interrupt problem.  You should still try to
solve the problem since polling uses excessive computer resources.</P>
<P>Checking to find the interrupt conflict may not be easy since Linux
supposedly doesn't permit any interrupt conflicts and will send you a
<A HREF="#busy_err">/dev/ttyS?: Device or resource busy</A> error
message if it thinks you are attempting to create a conflict.  But a
real conflict can be created if "setserial" has told the kernel
incorrect info.  The kernel has been lied to and thus doesn't think
there is any conflict.  Thus using "setserial" will not reveal the
conflict (nor will looking at /proc/interrupts which bases its info on
"setserial").  You still need to know what "setserial" thinks so that
you can pinpoint where it's wrong and change it when you determine
what's really set in the hardware.</P>
<P>What you need to do is to check how the hardware is set by checking
jumpers or using PnP software to check how the hardware is actually
set.  For PnP run either "pnpdump --dumpregs" (if ISA bus) or run
"lspci" (if PCI bus).  Compare this to how Linux (e.g. "setserial")
thinks the hardware is set.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.16">18.16</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.16">Somewhat Slow: I expected it to be a few times faster</A>
</H2>

<P> An obvious reason is that the baud rate is set too slow.  It's
claimed that this once happened by trying to set the baud rate to a
speed higher than the hardware can support (such as 230400).</P>
<P>Another reason may be that whatever is on the serial port (such as a
modem, terminal, printer) doesn't work as fast as you thought it did.
A 56k Modem seldom works at 56k and the Internet
often has congestion and bottlenecks that slow things down.  If the
modem on the other end does not have a digital connection to the phone
line (and uses a special "digital modem" not sold in most computer
stores), then speeds above 33.6k are not possible.</P>
<P>Another possible reason is that you have an obsolete serial port: UART
8250, 16450 or early 16550 (or the serial driver thinks you do).  See
"What are UARTS" in the Serial-HOWTO. </P>
<P>Use "setserial -g /dev/ttyS*".
If it shows anything less than a 16550A, this may be your problem.
If you think that "setserial" has it wrong check it out.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A> for more info.  If you
really do have an obsolete serial port, lying about it to setserial
will only make things worse.</P>

<H2><A NAME="irqs_shown_wrong"></A> <A NAME="ss18.17">18.17</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.17">The Startup Screen Shows Wrong IRQs for the Serial Ports</A>
</H2>

<P> For non-PnP ports, Linux does not do any IRQ detection on startup.
When the serial module loads it only does serial device detection.
Thus, disregard what it says about the IRQ, because it's just assuming
the standard IRQs.  This is done, because IRQ detection is unreliable,
and can be fooled.  But if and when setserial runs from a start-up
script, it changes the IRQ's and displays the new (and hopefully
correct) state on on the startup screen.  If the wrong IRQ is not
corrected by a later display on the screen, then you've got a problem.</P>
<P>So, even though I have my <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> set at IRQ 5, I still see
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

"tty02" which is the same as ttyS2).  You may need to use

sometimes prevent opening the port.  An example of this is where the
device has negated CD and the CD pin on your PC is negated (negative
voltage). </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.21">18.21</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.21">"Operation not supported by device" for ttyS?</A>
</H2>

<P> This means that an operation requested by setserial, stty, etc.
couldn't be done because the kernel doesn't support doing it.
Formerly this was often due to the "serial" module not being loaded.
But with the advent of PnP, it may likely mean that there is no modem
(or other serial device) at the address where the driver (and
setserial) thinks it is.  If there is no modem there, commands (for
operations) sent to that address obviously don't get done.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#io-irq_in_hdw">What is set in my serial port hardware?</A></P>
<P>If the "serial" module wasn't loaded but "lsmod" shows you it's now
loaded it might be the case that it's loaded now but wasn't loaded
when you got the error message.  In many cases the module will
automatically loaded when needed (if it can be found).  To force
loading of the "serial" module it may be listed in the file:
/etc/modules.conf or /etc/modules.  The actual module should reside
in: /lib/modules/.../misc/serial.o.</P>

</H2>

<P> Sometimes when it can't create a lockfile you get the erroneous
message: "... Device or resource busy" instead of the one above.
When a port is "opened" by a program a lockfile is created in
/var/lock/.  Wrong permissions for the lock directory will not allow a
lockfile to be created there.  Use "ls -ld /var/lock" to see if the
permissions are OK.  Giving rwx permissions for the root owner and the
group should work, provided that the users that need to dialout belong
to that group.  Others should have r-x permission.  Even with this
scheme, there may be a security risk.  Use "chmod" to change
permissions and "chgrp" to change groups.  Of course, if there is no
"lock" directory no lockfile can be created there.  For more info on
lockfiles see the Serial-HOWTO subsection: "What Are Lock
Files".</P>

</H2>

<P> This means that someone else (or some other process) is supposedly
using the serial port.  There are various ways to try to find out what
process is "using" it.  One way is to look at the contents of the
lockfile (/var/lock/LCK...).  It should be the process id.  If the
process id is say 100 type "ps 100" to find out what it is.  Then if
the process is no longer needed, it may be gracefully killed by "kill
100".  If it refuses to be killed use "kill -9 100" to force it to be
killed, but then the lockfile will not be removed and you'll need to
delete it manually.  Of course if there is no such process as 100 then
you may just remove the lockfile but in most cases the lockfile should
have been automatically removed if it contained a stale process id
(such as 100).</P>

<H2><A NAME="busy_err"></A> <A NAME="ss18.24">18.24</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.24">"/dev/tty? Device or resource busy" </A>
</H2>

<P> This means that the device you are trying to access (or use) is
supposedly busy (in use) or that a resource it needs (such as an IRQ)
is supposedly being used by another device and can't be shared.
This message is easy to understand if it only means that the device is
busy (in use).  But it sometimes means that a needed resource is already
in use (busy).  What makes it even more confusing is that in some cases
neither the device nor the resources that it needs are actually
"busy".  </P>
<P>In olden days, if a PC was shutdown by just turning off the power, a
bogus lockfile might remain and then later on one would get this bogus
message and not be able to use the serial port.  Software today is
supposed to automatically remove such bogus lockfiles, but as of 2006
there is still a problem with the "wvdial" dialer program related to
lockfiles.  If wvdial can't create a lockfile because it doesn't have
write permission in the /var/lock/ directory, you will see this
erroneous message.  See 
<A HREF="#lockfile_">Cannot create lockfile. Sorry</A> </P>
<P>The following example is where interrupts can't be shared (at least
one of the interrupts is on the ISA bus).  The ``resource busy'' part
often means (example for <CODE>ttyS2</CODE>) ``You can't use <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> since
another device is using ttyS2's interrupt.'' The potential interrupt
conflict is inferred from what "setserial" thinks.  A more accurate
error message would be ``Can't use <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> since the setserial data
(and kernel data) indicates that another device is using <CODE>ttyS2</CODE>'s
interrupt''.  If two devices use the same IRQ and you start up only
one of the devices, everything is OK because there is no conflict yet.
But when you next try to start the second device (without quitting the
first device) you get a "... busy" error message.  This is because the
kernel only keeps track of what IRQs are actually in use and actual
conflicts don't happen unless the devices are in use (open).   The
situation for I/O address (such as 0x3f8) conflict is similar.</P>
<P>This error is sometimes due to having two serial drivers: one a module
and the other compiled into the kernel.  Both drivers try to grab the
same resources and one driver finds them "busy".</P>
<P>There are two possible cases when you see this message:
<OL>
<LI> There may be a real resource conflict that is being avoided.</LI>
<LI> Setserial has it wrong and the only reason <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> can't be
used is that setserial erroneously predicts a conflict.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>What you need to do is to find the interrupt setserial thinks
<CODE>ttyS2</CODE> is using.  Look at /proc/tty/driver/serial.  You should
also be able to find it with the "setserial" command for <CODE>ttyS2</CODE>.   </P>
<P>Bug in old versions:  Prior to 2001 there was a bug which wouldn't let
you see it with "setserial".  Trying to see it would give the same
"... busy" error message.</P>
<P>To try to resolve this problem reboot or: exit or gracefully kill all
likely conflicting processes.   If you reboot: 1. Watch the boot-time
messages for the serial ports.  2. Hope that the file that runs
"setserial" at boot-time doesn't (by itself) create the same conflict
again.</P>
<P>If you think you know what IRQ say <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> is using then you may
look at /proc/interrupts to find what else (besides another serial
port) is currently using this IRQ.  You might also want to double
check that any suspicious IRQs shown here (and by "setserial") are
correct (the same as set in the hardware).  A way to test whether or
not it's a potential interrupt conflict is to set the IRQ to 0
(polling) using "setserial".  Then if the busy message goes away, it
was likely a potential interrupt conflict.  It's not a good idea to
leave it permanently set at 0 since it will put more load on the CPU.</P>

</H2>

<P> This means that communication with the serial port isn't working
right.  It could mean that there isn't any serial port at the IO
address that setserial thinks your port is at.  It could also be an
interrupt conflict (or an IO address conflict).  It also may mean that
the serial port is in use (busy or opened) and thus the attempt to
get/set parameters by setserial or stty failed.  It will also happen
if you make a typo in the serial port name such as typing "ttys"
instead of "ttyS".  </P>

</H2>

<P>LSR is the name of a hardware register.  It usually means that 
there is no serial port at the address where the driver thinks your
serial port is located.  You need to find your serial port and
possibly configure it.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#locate_port">Locating the Serial Port: IO address IRQs</A> and/or

</H2>

<P> This is an overrun of the hardware FIFO buffer and you can't
increase its size.  Bug note (reported in 2002): Due to a bug in some
kernel 2.4 versions, the port number may be missing and you will only
see "ttyS" (no port number).  But if devfs notation such as "tts/2" is
being used, there is no bug.  See 
"Higher Serial Thruput" in the Serial-HOWTO.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.28">18.28</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc18.28">Modem doesn't pick up incoming calls</A>
</H2>

<P> This paragraph is for the case where a modem is used for both
dial-in and dial-out.  If the modem generates a DCD (=CD) signal, some
programs (but not mgetty) will think that the modem is busy.
This will cause a problem when you are trying to dial out with a modem
and the modem's DCD or DTR are not implemented correctly.  The modem
should assert DCD only when there is an actual connection (ie someone
has dialed in), not when <CODE>getty</CODE> is watching the port.  Check to
make sure that your modem is configured to only assert DCD when there
is a connection (&amp;C1).  DTR should be on (asserted) by the
communications program whenever something is using, or watching the
line, like <CODE>getty</CODE>, <CODE>kermit</CODE>, or some other comm program. </P>

</H2>

<P> There could be some other program running on the port.  Use "top"
(provided you've set it to display the port number) or type "ps
-alxw".  Look at the results to see if the port is being used by
another program.  Be on the lookout for the gpm mouse program which
often runs on a serial port.</P>

<UL>
<LI> "lsof /dev/ttyS*" will list serial ports which are open.</LI>

<LI> "modemstat" or "statserial" or "watch head
/proc/tty/driver/serial" will show the current state of various modem
signal lines (such as DTR, CTS, etc.).  The one in /proc also shows
byte flow and errors.</LI>
<LI> "irqtune" will give serial port interrupts higher
priority to improve performance.</LI>
<LI> "hdparm" for hard-disk tuning may help some more.</LI>
<LI> "lspci" shows the actual IRQs, etc. of hardware on the PCI bus.</LI>
<LI> "pnpdump --dumpregs" shows the actual IRQs, etc. of hardware for
