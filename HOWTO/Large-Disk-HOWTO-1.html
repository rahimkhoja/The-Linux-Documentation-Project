<P>You got a new disk. What to do? Well, on the software side:
use <CODE>fdisk</CODE> or <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> to create partitions,
and then <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> or <CODE>mkreiserfs</CODE> or so to create a filesystem,
and then <CODE>mount</CODE> to attach the new filesystem to the big file hierarchy.
Make sure you have relatively recent versions of these utilities -
often old versions have problems handling large disks.
<P>You need not read this HOWTO since there are <EM>no</EM> problems
with large hard disks these days.
<P>Long ago, disks were large when they had a capacity larger than
528 MB, or than 8.4 GB, or than 33.8 GB. These days the interesting
limit is 137 GB. In all cases, sufficiently recent Linux kernels
handle the disk fine.
<P>Sometimes booting requires some care, since Linux cannot help you
when it isn't running yet. But again, with a sufficiently recent
BIOS and boot loader there are no problems.
Most of the text below will treat the cases of
(i) ancient hardware,
(ii) broken hardware or BIOS,
(iii) several operating systems on the same disk,
(iv) booting old systems.
<P><B>Advice</B>
<P>For large SCSI disks: Linux has supported them from very early on.
No action required.
<P>For large IDE disks (over 8.4 GB): make sure your kernel is 2.0.34 or later.
<P>For large IDE disks (over 33.8 GB): make sure your kernel is
2.0.39/2.2.14/2.3.21 or later.
<P>For large IDE disks (over 137 GB): make sure your kernel is
2.4.19/2.5.3 or later.
<P>If the kernel boots fine, and the boot messages indicate that it
recognizes the disk correctly, but there are problems with utilities,
upgrade the utilities.
<P>If 
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-5.html#LILO">LILO</A> hangs at boot time, make sure you have
version 21.4 or later, and specify the keyword <CODE>lba32</CODE>
in the configuration file <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE>. With an older version
of LILO, try both with and without the <CODE>linear</CODE> keyword.
<P>There may be geometry problems that can be solved by giving
an explicit geometry to kernel/LILO/fdisk.
<P>If you have an old <CODE>fdisk</CODE> and it warns about
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-6.html#overlap">overlapping</A> partitions:
ignore the warnings, or check using <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> that really all is well.
<P>For HPT366, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b6506063/hpt366/">Linux HPT366 HOWTO</A>.
<P>If at boot time the kernel cannot read the partition table,
consider the possibility that UDMA66 was selected while
the controller or the cable or the disk drive did not
support UDMA66. In such a case every attempt to read will
fail, and reading the partition table is the first thing
the kernel does. Make sure no UDMA66 is used.
<P>If the BIOS hangs at boot time because of a large disk, and
flashing a newer version is not an option, take the disk out
of the BIOS setup. If you have to boot from the disk, look
whether a capacity clipping jumper helps.
<P>If you think something is wrong with the size of your disk,
make sure that you are not confusing binary and decimal 
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-2.html#units">units</A>
,
and realize that the free space that <CODE>df</CODE> reports on an empty disk
is a few percent smaller than the partition size, because there
is administrative overhead. Software that does not understand
48-bit addressing will view a 137+ GB disk as having a capacity
of 137 GB. When a capacity clipping 
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-11.html#jumpers">jumper</A>
is present, a larger disk may have been clipped to 33 GB or to 2 GB.
<P>If for a removable drive the kernel reports two different sizes,
then one is found from the drive, and the other from the disk/floppy.
This second value will be zero when the drive has no media.
<P>Now, if you still think there are problems, or just are curious,
read on.
<P>Below a rather detailed description of all relevant details.
I used kernel version 2.0.8 source as a reference.
Other versions may differ a bit.
<P>
