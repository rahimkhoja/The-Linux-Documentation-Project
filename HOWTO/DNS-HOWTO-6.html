<P><B>Setting configuration options to reduce the possibility of
problems.</B>
<P>
<P>There are a few simple steps that you can take which will both make
your server more secure and potentially reduce its load. The material
presented here is nothing more than a starting point; if you are
concerned about security (and you should be), please consult other
resources on the net (see 
<A HREF="DNS-HOWTO-11.html#bigger">the last chapter</A>).
<P>
<P>The following configuration directives occur in <CODE>named.conf</CODE>. If
a directive occurs in the <CODE>options</CODE> section of the file, it applies
to all zones listed in that file. If it occurs within a <CODE>zone</CODE>
entry, it applies only to that zone. A <CODE>zone</CODE> entry overrides an
<CODE>options</CODE> entry.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Restricting zone transfers</A>
</H2>

<P>In order for your slave server(s) to be able to answer queries
about your domain, they must be able to transfer the zone information
from your primary server.  Very few others have a need to do so.
Therefore restrict zone transfers using the <CODE>allow-transfer</CODE>
option, assuming 192.168.1.4 is the IP address of ns.friend.bogus and
adding yourself for debugging purposes:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
zone "linux.bogus" {
      allow-transfer { 192.168.1.4; localhost; };
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>By restricting zone transfers you ensure that the only information
available to people is that which they ask for directly - no one can
just ask for all the details about your set-up.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Protecting against spoofing</A>
</H2>

<P>Firstly, disable any queries for domains you don't own, except
from your internal/local machines. This not only helps prevent
malicious use of your DNS server, but also reduces unnecessary use of
your server.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
options {
      allow-query { 192.168.196.0/24; localhost; };
};

zone "linux.bogus" {
      allow-query { any; };
};

zone "196.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
      allow-query { any; };
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Further, disable recursive queries except from internal/local
sources. This reduces the risk of cache poisoning attacks (where false
data is fed to your server).
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
options {
        allow-recursion { 192.168.196.0/24; localhost; };
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Running named as non-root</A>
</H2>

<P>It is a good idea to run named as a user other than root, so that
if it is compromised the privileges gained by the cracker are as
limited as possible. You first have to create a user for named to run
under, and then modify whatever init script you use that starts
named. Pass the new user name and group to named using the -u and -g
flags.
<P>
<P>For example, in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 you might modify your
<CODE>/etc/init.d/bind</CODE> script to have the following line (where
user <CODE>named</CODE> have been created):
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --exec /usr/sbin/named -- -u named 
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The same can be done with Red Hat and the other distributions.
<P>
<P>Dave Lugo has described a secure dual chroot setup 
<A HREF="http://www.etherboy.com/dns/chrootdns.html">http://www.etherboy.com/dns/chrootdns.html</A> which you may find
interesting to read, it makes the host your run your named on even
more secure.
