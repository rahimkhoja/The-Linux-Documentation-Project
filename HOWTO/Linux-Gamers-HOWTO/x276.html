				that explicit modelines are no longer necessary, since XFree 4.0.1 and up computes
				modetimings automatically based on your monitor's and video card's capabilities.  However,

>4.2. Playing Games In X Without a Window Manager</H2
><P
>When playing a game under X, you should consider starting X without a window manager
			(WM).  Heavyweight WMs, like Enlightenment, or full-blown desktop environments like GNOME or
			KDE, may produce a noticeable slow down.  Even lightweight WMs, like twm, rob your CPU of
			clock cycles (and in twm's case, even full screen games will have a frame around the window).
			Running a game without a WM or DE depends on how you access X.  If you usually log in to a
			Virtual Console and start X with "startx" try the following: </P
><P
>Modify <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.xinitrc</TT
>, which tells X what to run upon starting.  Here
			is what my .xinitrc looks like:</P

      exec /usr/bin/enlightenment
			</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>You'll usually see a window or desktop manager being executed from this file (GNOME or
			KDE).  Comment out the lines containing the WM or desktop manager with a pound sign (#) and
			place your game on a new line with any command line arguments you want to pass.  If the game
			is not located in your $PATH, give its full path name.</P
><P
>If you log directly into X using gdm, then things are a little different. These
			instructions are for gdm 2.4 or greater. They *may* work with kde, but I cannot say for
			certain.</P
><P
>First, check your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gdm.conf</TT
> (usually in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/gdm</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/gdm</TT
>)
			file for a line that says begins "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SessionDesktopDir=blah</TT
>".  One of the
			directories listed as options should be "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/share/xsessions</TT
>", and is the directory which will be used in
			this example.  As root, change to the "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/share/xsessions</TT
>" directory and take a look at its contents.
			It should contain some <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.desktop</TT
> files, each corresponding to an entry
			you'll see in gdm's Session menu, e.g <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gnome.desktop</TT
>,
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>enlightenment.destop</TT
>.  This example will show you how to log in to Doom3.
			Copy any of the desktop files to "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>doom3.desktop</TT
>" and open the new file in
			your favourite text editor.  The file will be full of alternative languages, so cut out
			everything you don't want and make the file look like this:</P
