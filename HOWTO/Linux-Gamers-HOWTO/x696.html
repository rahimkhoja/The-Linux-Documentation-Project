>8.1. Which sound card is best?</H2
><P
>By the word "best" I mean best for gaming.  Gamers want high quality sound for our games
			with the least amount of tinkering.  On the other hand, a musician would have a very different
			concept of what "best sound card" would mean.  If you're a musician, you might want to check
			out the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdj.com/audio/quality/"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Audio Quality
			HOWTO</A
>.</P
><P
>Now that Linux is beginning to mature, this question isn't as important as it used to
			be.  Once upon a time, soundcards without onboard MIDI chips (most PCI sound cards) didn't do
			MIDI.  This was mostly a problem for things like xdoom or lxdoom using musserv.  These days we
			have MIDI emulators like Timidity and libraries like SDL which don't require hardware MIDI
			support.  Frankly, I've had many cards and I can't tell the difference between any of them for
			gaming.  If you want to do things like convert a record LP to digital format, then your choice
			of a soundcard with a professional grade A/D converter is absolutely crucial.  For this HOWTO,
			we'll assume that you're more of a gamer than a studio recording engineer.</P
><P
>Your decision should be based on what will be the easiest to configure.  If you already
			have a card and it works well, that's good enough.  If you're in the market to buy a sound
			card, get something that will take you a second to configure.  PCI cards are much easier to
			deal with than ISA since you don't need to tell their drivers about which system resources
			(IRQ, DMA, I/O addresses) to use.  Some ISA cards ARE plug-n-play, like the Creative AWE-64,
			and the Linux kernel has come a long way in auto configuring them.</P
><P
>My personal recommendation is any card which has the es1370 or es1371 chip, which uses
			the es1370 and es1371 sound drivers on Linux.  These cards include the older Ensoniq es1370
			and newer Creative PCI-128.  These cards are extremely cheap and trivial to get working under
			Linux.</P
><P
>I used to be a fan of the Creative Soundblaster AWE 32, AWE 64 and AWE 64 gold
			soundcards.  These ISA PnP cards are well supported by both OSS and Alsa.  They all use the
			same E-mu 8000 synthesis chip which enables them to play 32 voices simultaneously (they have
			32 "channels").  A few notes: First, the Soundblaster AWE HOWTO is very out of date.  Second,
			the AWE 64 and AWE 64 gold can play 64 voices simultaneously, but this is done in software.
			Creative never released a Linux driver for these cards (and they never released programming
			information to Linux developers), so Linux users cannot use the extra 32 channels on the AWE
			64 and AWE 64 gold.  As far Linux users are concerned, all three cards are completely
			identical (although the AWE 64 gold has gold plated connectors, which are better for sound
			quality than the more common steel connectors).</P
><P
>The Creative Soundblaster Live! is an extremely popular PCI sound card these days.  I've
			never owned one, so I cannot comment here.  However, there have been numerous reports about
			serious problems with the Live! and AMD motherboards that use the 686b southbridge.  A google
			search should turn up alot of information on this problem.</P
><P
>A more relevent issue is speakers, but even here the difference isn't huge.  I've had
			expensive Altec Lansing speakers perform only slightly better than el-cheapo speakers.  You
			get what you pay for with speakers, but don't expect a huge difference.  You'll want to get
			something with a separate sub-woofer; this does make a difference at a cost of extra power and
			connector wires.</P

>8.2. Why isn't my sound working?</H2
><P
>First of all, it's probably not the game, it's probably your setup.  AFAIK, there are 3
			options to getting a sound card configured under Linux: the free OSS sound drivers that come
			with the Linux kernel, the Alsa drivers and the commercial OSS sound drivers.  Personally, I
			prefer the free OSS drivers, but many people swear by Alsa.  The commercial OSS drivers are
			good when you're having trouble getting your sound card to work by free methods.  Don't
			discount them; they're very cheap (like 10 or 20 bucks), support bleeding edge sound cards and
			take a lot of guesswork out of the configuring process.</P

>The second column is there because I have 2 CPU's in this machine; if you have one
					CPU (called UP, or uniprocessor), you'll have only 1 CPU column.  The numbers on the left
					are the assigned IRQ's and the strings to the right indicate what device was assigned that
					IRQ.  You can see I have an IRQ conflict between the soundcard (soundblaster) and the
					network card (eth0).  They both share IRQ 5.  Actually, I cooked this example up because I
					wanted to show you what an IRQ conflict looks like.  But if I did have this conflict,
					neither my network nor my sound would work well (or at all!).</P
><P
>If my sound card is PCI, the preferred way of fixing this would be to simply move
					one of the cards to a different slot and hope the BIOS sorts things out.  A more advanced
					way of fixing this would be to go into BIOS and assign IRQ's to specific slots.  Modern
					BIOS'es can do this.</P

>8.2.2. Misconfigured driver</H3
><P
>Sometimes, a card is hardwired to use a certain IRQ.  You'll see this on ISA cards
					only.  Alternatively, some ISA cards can be set to use a specific IRQ using jumpers on the
					card itself.  With these types of cards, you need to pass the correct IRQ and memory
					access, "I/O port", to the driver.</P

>8.2.3. Something is already accessing your sound card</H3
><P
>Perhaps an application is already accessing your soundcard.  For example, maybe you
					have an MP3 player that's paused?  If something is already accessing your card, other
					applications won't be able to.  Even though it was written to share the card between
					applications, I've found that esd (the enlightenment sound daemon) sometimes doesn't work
					correctly.  The best tool to use here is lsof, which shows which processes are accessing a
					file.  Your sound card is represented by <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/dsp</TT
>.
					Right now, I'm listening to an MP3 (not a Metallica MP3, of course...) with

><LI
><P
>You must have the correct driver loaded into memory</P

></OL
><P
>You can find out which driver your sound card is using by doing "lsmod" or looking
					at the output of "dmesg".  Since sound is crucial for me, I always compile sound into my
					kernels.  If you don't have a driver loaded, you need to figure out what's been compiled
					into your kernel.  That's not so straight forward.  Your best bet is to compile your
					kernel.  BTW, let me say that compiling your own kernel is the first step towards
					proficiency with Linux.  It's painful the first time you do it, but once you do it
					correctly, it becomes very easy down the right, especially if you keep all your old
					.config files and make use of things like "make oldconfig".  See the Kernel HOWTO for
					details.</P
><P
>If you haven't compiled the kernel yourself, there is an overwhelmingly good chance
					that your system is set up to load sound drivers as modules.  That's the way distros do
					things.  Have everything under the sun compiled as a module and try to load them all.  So
					if you don't see your sound card's driver with lsmod, your card probably isn't configured
					yet.</P

					card using <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>ls -l /dev/dsp</B
></TT
>; it'll probably be
					<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>audio</TT
>.  Then, as root, add your non-root user to the audio group in
					<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/group</TT

><P
>Don't forget to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>grpconv</B
> if you use shadow passwords
(which should be the case on most recent distributions) in order to maintain a consistent group
configuration. Then log out and log back in as the non-root user. Your sound card should work.
