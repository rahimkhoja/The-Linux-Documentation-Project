>5.1. Memory Type Range Registers</H2
><P
>Starting with Pentium class processors and including Athlon, K6-2 and other CPUs, there
		are Memory Type Range Registers (MTRR) which control how the processor accesses ranges of memory
		locations.  Basically, it turns many smaller separate writes to the video card into a single
		write (a burst).  This increases efficiency in writing to the video card and can speed up your
		graphics by 250% or more.</P
><P
>See <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt</TT
> for details.  Note that
		since this file was written, XFree86 has been patched to automatically detect your video RAM
		base address and size and set up the MTRRs.</P

>5.3. About libraries on Linux</H2
><P
>A common problem you'll see in gaming is a library file not being found.  They're kind of
		mysterious and have funny names, so we'll go over libraries on Linux for a bit.  There are two
		types of libraries, static and dynamic.  When you compile a program, by default,
		<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> uses dynamic libraries, but you can make <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> use
		static libraries instead by using the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-static</TT
> switch.  Unless you plan on
		compiling your games from source code, you'll mainly be interested in dynamic libraries.</P

>5.3.1. Dynamic libraries</H3
><P
>Dynamic libraries, also called a &#8220;shared library&#8221;, provide object code for
			an application while it's running.  That is, code gets linked into the executable at run time,
			as opposed to compile time.  They're analagous to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.dll</TT
>'s used by
			Windows.  The program responsible for linking code &#8220;on the fly&#8221; is called
			<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/etc/ld.so</B

>In contrast to dynamic libraries which provide code while the application runs, static

			compiled.  No code gets inserted at run time; the code is completely self-contained.  Static
			libraries usually end with <TT

>5.3.3. How are library files found</H3
><P
>If you compile your own games, your biggest problem with libraries will either be that
			<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> can't find a static library or perhaps the library doesn't exist on
			your system.  When playing games from binary, your library woes will be either be that
			<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ld.so</B
> can't find the library or the library doesn't exist on your system.
			So it makes some sense to talk about how <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ld.so</B
>
			go about finding libraries in the first place.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> looks for libraries in the ``standard system directories'' plus
			any directories you specify with the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-L</TT
> option.  You can find what these
			standard system directories are with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc -print-search-dirs</B
></P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ld.so</B
> looks to a binary hash contained in a file named
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.cache</TT
> for a list of directories that contain available dynamic
			libraries.  Since it contains binary data, you cannot modify this file directly.  However, the
			file is generated from a text file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.conf</TT
> which you can edit.
			This file contains a list of directories that you want <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ld.so</B
> to search for
			dynamic libraries.  If you want to start putting dynamic libraries in
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/joecool/privatelibs</TT
>, you'd add this directory to
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.conf</TT
>.  Your change doesn't actually make it into
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.cache</TT
> until you run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ldconfig</B
>; once it's
			run, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ld.so</B
> will begin to look for libraries in your private
			directory.</P
><P
>Also, even if you just add extra libraries to your system, you must update
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ld.so.cache</TT

>As you can see, this gives us slighly different results. The NWN library directories

>libmss.so.6</TT
> in the "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>./miles</TT
>"
			directory, and also finds the local copy of libSDL first, no longer using the system
			copy.</P
><P
>There's another benefit of these scripts: they are easily edited to allow you to provide
			your own copy of a library.  Any game-supplied copy of a library such as OpenAL or SDL is
			likely to be compiled for the lowest common denominator, probably i486 or i686. If you have a
			Pentium4 or an AthlonXP, you could compile you own version specifically for your processor.
			The compiler will try to optimise the resulting binary, giving some increase in performance.
			See the homepage for GCC for more information this at <A
HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org"

			site.</A
></P
><P
>Making NWN use your system copy is easy.  It says so in the wrapper script!  Remove
			"./lib:" from the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT
> line, and you're good to go.</P
><P
>Another nice little trick is for games that use OpenAL for their sound output (e.g.
			Unreal based games: UT, Postal, Rune, etc.).  Since the Open Sound System's (OSS) deprecation
			in favour of ALSA, all Linux distributions I've seen now ship with ALSA support as default,
			with OSS support actually being supplied via ALSA's compatability modules.  The copies of
			<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>openal.so</TT
> distributed with games often do NOT support
			ALSA, so making the game use a copy compiled yourself will allow you to use ALSA
			natively.</P
