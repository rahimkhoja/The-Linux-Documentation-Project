>11.1. SCUMM Engine (LucasArts)</H2

			scummvm.</P
><P
>A compatibility page is maintained at the scummvm website.  FWIW, I've been able to
			finish many of the games that are listed as 90% done with no problems.  scummvm is rock solid,
			and allows you to purchase SCUMM based Lucas Arts games, copy the data files to your hard
			drive and play them under Linux.   As of February 2002, I've been following their cvs, and
			this project is undergoing constant development.  Kudos to the scummvm team.</P

>11.2. AGI: Adventure Gaming Interface (Sierra)</H2
><P
>The older Sierra DOS graphical adventure games used a scripting language named AGI
			(Adventure Gaming Interface).  Some examples of games written in AGI would be Leisure Suit
			Larry I (EGA), Space Quest I and II, King's Quest II, Mixed-Up Mother Goose and others.  These
			games can be played using <SPAN

>sarien</SPAN

HREF="http://sarien.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sarien.sourceforge.net</A
>&#62;, an open source interpreter for AGI
			games.</P
><P
>Sarien was written in SDL, so it should run on any platform that can compile SDL
			programs.  In addition, there are versions for DOS, Strong-Arm based pda's, QNS (holy cow!
			embedded gaming!), MIPS based systems and SH3/4 based Pocket PC's.  The developers are clearly
			out of their minds (in a good way!).   Sarien also has numerous enhancements not found in the
			original games, like a Quake style pull-down console, picture and dictionary viewer, enhanced
			sound and support for AGDS, a Russian AGI clone.  Sarien is under development and the
			developers have been very good about documenting the Sarien internals if anyone wants to get
			involved in hacking it.</P

>11.3. SCI: SCript Interpreter or Sierra Creative Interpreter (Sierra)</H2
><P
>The newer Sierra graphical adventure games (we're talking about the late 80's here) used
			an interpreter named SCI.  There were many versions of SCI since Sierra was constantly
			improving its engine.  The original SCI games were DOS based, but Sierra eventually started
			releasing Win32 SCI based games.  Some examples of games written with SCI are Leisure Suit
			Larry 1 (VGA),  Leisure Suit Larry 2-7, Space Quest 3-6, King's Quest 4-6, Quest For Glory 1-4
			and many others.  Compared with AGI games, SCI adventures have better music support, a more
			complex engine and loads of bells and whistles.</P
><P
>Many SCI based games (games written in SCI0) can be played using
			<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>freesci</SPAN
>, available at <A
HREF="http://freesci.linuxgames.com"
TARGET="_top"
>http://freesci.linuxgames.com</A
>.   Like Sarien, FreeSCI has many graphics targets
			including SDL, xlib and GGI, so this program can compile and run under an incredible number
			of platforms.  The developers have done a fantastic job of documenting and FAQing their
			application.</P

>http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/zspec/index.html</A
>&#62; virtual machine designed by
			Infocom to run their interactive fiction games.  This allowed them to write game data files in
			a cross platform manner, since only the engine itself, the Z-machine, would be platform
			dependent.  Z-machine went through a number of revisions during the lifetime of Infocom, and
			two further revisions (V7 and V8 created by Graham Nelson) after the Infocom's demise.  The
			later versions even supported limited sound and graphics!</P
><P
>One of the most popular Z-machine interpreters is Frotz &#60;<A
HREF="http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz/</A
>&#62;.  This excellently done page
			has many nice links for interactive fiction fans.  Frotz is GPL, runs all versions of
			Z-machine and will compile on most versions of Unix.  Frotz has spawned many forks, like a
			version for PalmOS and Linux based PDA's.</P
><P
>jzip &#60;<A
HREF="http://jzip.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://jzip.sourceforge.net/</A
>&#62; is another very popular
			Z-machine interpreter that will run V1-V5 and V8 Z-machine data files.  jzip is very portable;
			it compiles on all Unices, OS/2, Atari ST and DOS.</P
><P
>There are actually many other Z-machine interpreters like nitfol and rezrov (written in
			Perl!).  Each interpreter has its own set of strengths, and you can find links to them on the
			home pages for Frotz and jzip.</P

>11.5. Scott Adams Adventures (Adventure International)</H2
><P
>Scott Adams is, arguably, the father of interactive fiction.  Although he himself was
			inspired by the first piece of interactive fiction, Adventure, Scott brought adventuring to
			the masses.  His games were available for Atari, Apple 2, Commodore, Sorcerer, TI, and CPM.
			His company, Adventure International, released a number of much loved games between 1978 and
			1984 before folding.   He recently released a new game (a Linux version is not available) but
			since the decline of adventuring, he has pretty much kept out of the gaming industry.</P

>Alan Cox wrote scottfree, a Scott Adams adventure game file interpreter for Unix.  Using

HREF="http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://uwadv.sourceforge.net/</A
>&#62; is an effort to port the 1992 classic, Ultima
			Underworld: The Stygian Abyss, to modern operating systems like Linux, MacOS X, and Windows.
			It uses OpenGL for 3D graphics, SDL for platform specific tasks and is released under the GNU
			GPL.  Underworld Adventures provides an impressive graphics system which uses the original
			game files, so you'll need the original game disk to play.</P
><P
>Underworld Adventures also provides a bunch of tools for you to display the level maps,
			tools for examining uw1 conversation scripts and more.</P

>11.7. Ultima 7 (Origin, Electronic Arts)</H2
><P
>Ultima 7 is actually 2 games: part I (The Black Gate) and part II (Serpent Island) which
			uses a slightly enhanced version of The Black Gate's engine.  In addition, an addon disk was
			released to both part I (The Forge Of Virtue) and part II (The Silver Seed).</P
><P
>A team of people developed <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Exult</SPAN
> &#60;<A
HREF="http://exult.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://exult.sourceforge.net/</A
>&#62; which is an open source interpreter that will
			run both parts of Ultima 7 and their addon disks.  Exult is written in C++ using SDL, so it
			will compile on any platform that can compile SDL programs.  It also features some
			enhancements over the original versions of the Ultima VII engine.  You'll need to purchase a
			copy of Ultima 7 to play.  The developers have no plans on extending Exult to interpret the
			other Ultimas since the engines changed so radically between releases.</P
><P
>The Exult team has also been hard at work creating a map editor, Exult Studio, and a
			script compiler that will let users create their own RPG in the Ultima style.</P

>11.8. System Shock (Electronic Arts, Origin)</H2
><P
>System Shock is a classic first person shooter/adventure from 1994, which puts it as a
			contemporary of Doom.  However, its engine is much more feature rich than the original Doom:
			for example, System Shock had 3D sprites, free look and a facility to have objects on top of
			each other, giving the illusion of a full 3D map, like Quake.  Game reviewers agree that this
			game has the features of Quake with a story-line more compelling than Half-life.  The System
			Shock engine was optimized for sophistication, while Doom's engine was optimized for throwing
			lots of monsters at you; a completely different appoach.  Quite impressive for such an old
			game!</P
><P
>The System Shock Hack Project &#60;<A
HREF="http://madeira.physiol.ucl.ac.uk/tsshp/sshock.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://madeira.physiol.ucl.ac.uk/tsshp/sshock.html</A
>&#62; is an attempt to update
			the game for modern operating systems.  The project uses SDL and is released under the
			modified BSD license.  While you need the original game files to play SSHP, it should work
			with the System Shock demo, which is freely available.</P
