<H2><A NAME="s6">6. IP- and Ethernet-Related Information</A></H2>

<P>This section covers information specific to Ethernet and IP. These
subsections have been grouped together because I think they are the
most interesting ones in the formerly-called ``Technology Specific''
Section. Anyone with a LAN should be able to benefit from these
goodies.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Ethernet</A>
</H2>

<P>Ethernet device names are `<CODE>eth0</CODE>', `<CODE>eth1</CODE>', `<CODE>eth2</CODE>' etc. The first
card detected by the kernel is assigned `<CODE>eth0</CODE>' and the rest are assigned
sequentially in the order they are detected.
<P>By default, the Linux kernel only probes for one Ethernet device, you
need to pass command line arguments to the kernel in order to force detection
of furter boards.
<P>To learn how to make your ethernet card(s) working under Linux you
should refer to the 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet-HOWTO</A>.
<P>Once you have your kernel properly built to support your ethernet card then
configuration of the card is easy.
<P>Typically you would use something like (which most distributions already
do for you, if you configured them to support your ethernet):
<P>

<P>Most of the ethernet drivers were developed by Donald Becker,
<CODE>becker@CESDIS.gsfc.nasa.gov</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 EQL - multiple line traffic equaliser</A>
</H2>

<P>The EQL device name is `<CODE>eql</CODE>'. With the standard kernel source you may have
only one EQL device per machine. EQL provides a means of utilizing multiple
point to point lines such as PPP, slip or plip as a single logical link to
carry tcp/ip. Often it is cheaper to use multiple lower speed lines than to
have one high speed line installed.
<P><B>Kernel Compile Options</B>:

        Network device support  --->
            [*] Network device support
            &lt;*> EQL (serial line load balancing) support
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To support this mechanism the machine at the other end of the lines must also
support EQL. Linux, Livingstone Portmasters and newer dial-in servers support
compatible facilities.
<P>To configure EQL you will need the eql tools which are available from:
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/system/Serial/eql-1.2.tar.gz">metalab.unc.edu</A>.
<P>Configuration is fairly straightforward. You start by configuring the eql
interface. The eql interface is just like any other network device. You
configure the IP address and mtu using the <EM>ifconfig</EM> utility, so something
like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# ifconfig eql 192.168.10.1 mtu 1006
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Next you need to manually initiate each of the lines you will use. These may
be any combination of point to point network devices. How you initiate the
connections will depend on what sort of link they are, refer to the
appropriate sections for further information.
<P>Lastly you need to associate the serial link with the EQL device, this is
called `enslaving' and is done with the <EM>eql_enslave</EM> command as shown:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# eql_enslave eql sl0 28800
        root# eql_enslave eql ppp0 14400
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The `<EM>estimated speed</EM>' parameter you supply <EM>eql_enslave</EM> doesn't
do anything directly. It is used by the EQL driver to determine what share of
the datagrams that device should receive, so you can fine tune the balancing of
the lines by playing with this value.
<P>To disassociate a line from an EQL device you use the <EM>eql_emancipate</EM>
command as shown:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# eql_emancipate eql sl0
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You add routing as you would for any other point to point link, except your
routes should refer to the <CODE>eql</CODE> device rather than the actual serial
devices themselves, typically you would use:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# route add default eql
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The EQL driver was developed by Simon Janes, <CODE>simon@ncm.com</CODE>.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 IP Accounting (for Linux-2.0)</A>
</H2>

<P>The IP accounting features of the Linux kernel allow you to collect and
analyze some network usage data. The data collected comprises the number
of packets and the number of bytes accumulated since the figures were
last reset. You may specify a variety of rules to categorize the
figures to suit whatever purpose you may have. This option has been
removed in kernel 2.1.102, because the old ipfwadm-based firewalling
was replaced by ``ipfwchains''.

        Networking options  --->
            [*] IP: accounting
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After you have compiled and installed the kernel you need to use the
<EM>ipfwadm</EM> command to configure IP accounting. There are many different
ways of breaking down the accounting information that you might choose.
I've picked a simple example of what might be useful to use, you should
read the <EM>ipfwadm</EM> man page for more information.
<P>Scenario: You have a ethernet network that is linked to the internet via
a PPP link. On the ethernet you have a machine that offers a number of
services and that you are interested in knowing how much traffic is generated
by each of  ftp and world wide web traffic, as well as total tcp and udp
traffic.
<P>You might use a command set that looks like the following, which is shown as a
shell script:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        #!/bin/sh
        #
        # Flush the accounting rules
        ipfwadm -A -f

        localnet=44.136.8.96/29

        ipfwadm -A out -a -P tcp -S $any
        ipfwadm -A in  -a -P udp -D $any
        ipfwadm -A out -a -P udp -S $any
        #
        # List the rules
        ipfwadm -A -l -n
        #
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The names ``ftp-data'' and ``www'' refer to lines in
<CODE>/etc/services</CODE>.  The last command lists each of the Accounting
rules and displays the collected totals.
<P>An important point to note when analyzing IP accounting is that
<B>totals for all rules that match will be incremented</B> so that to
obtain differential figures you need to perform appropriate maths. For
example if I wanted to know how much data was not ftp nor www I would
substract the individual totals from the rule that matches all ports.

<P>The new accounting code is accessed via ``IP Firewall Chains''.
See 
<A HREF="http://www.adelaide.net.au/~rustcorp/ipfwchains/ipfwchains.html">the IP chains home page</A> for more information.  Among other
things, you'll now need to use <EM>ipchains</EM> instead of <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE>
to configure your filters. (From <CODE>Documentation/Changes</CODE> in the
latest kernel sources).
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 IP Aliasing</A>
</H2>

<P>There are some applications where being able to configure multiple
IP addresses to a single network device is useful. Internet Service
Providers often use this facility to provide a `customized' to their
World Wide Web and ftp offerings for their customers. You can refer to
the ``IP-Alias mini-HOWTO'' for more information than you find here.

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After compiling and installing your kernel with IP_Alias support
configuration is very simple. The aliases are added to virtual network
devices associated with the actual network device. A simple naming
convention applies to these devices being <CODE>&lt;devname>:&lt;virtual
dev num></CODE>, e.g. <CODE>eth0:0</CODE>, <CODE>ppp0:10</CODE> etc. Note that the the
ifname:number device can only be configured <EM>after</EM> the main
interface has been set up.
<P>For example, assume you have an ethernet network that supports two different
IP subnetworks simultaneously and you wish your machine to have direct access
to both, you could use something like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
        root# route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0

        root# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
        root# route add -net 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0:0
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To delete an alias you simply add a `<CODE>-</CODE>' to the end of its name and refer
to it and is as simple as:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# ifconfig eth0:0- 0
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>All routes associated with that alias will also be deleted automatically.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 IP Firewall (for Linux-2.0)</A>
</H2>

<P>IP Firewall and Firewalling issues are covered in more depth in the
<A HREF="Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall-HOWTO</A>. IP Firewalling allows
you to secure your machine against unauthorized network access by filtering
or allowing datagrams from or to IP addresses that you nominate. There are
three different classes of rules, incoming filtering, outgoing filtering and
forwarding filtering. Incoming rules are applied to datagrams that are
received by a network device. Outgoing rules are applied to datagrams that
are to be transmitted by a network device. Forwarding rules are applied to
datagrams that are received and are not for this machine, ie datagrams that
would be routed.

<P>Configuration of the IP firewall rules is performed using the <EM>ipfwadm</EM>
command. As I mentioned earlier, security is not something I am expert at,
so while I will present an example you can use, you should do your own
research and develop your own rules if security is important to you.
<P>Probably the most common use of IP firewall is when you are using your
linux machine as a router and firewall gateway to protect your local
network from unauthorized access from outside your network.
<P>The following configuration is based on a contribution from Arnt Gulbrandsen,
<CODE>&lt;agulbra@troll.no&gt;</CODE>.
<P>The example describes the configuration of the firewall rules on the Linux
firewall/router machine illustrated in this diagram:

<P>The following commands would normally be placed in an <CODE>rc</CODE> file
so that they were automatically started each time the system
boots. For maximum security they would be performed after the network
interfaces are configured, but before the interfaces are actually
brought up to prevent anyone gaining access while the firewall machine

<P>Good firewall configurations are a little tricky. This example
should be a reasonable starting point for you. The <EM>ipfwadm</EM>
manual page offers some assistance in how to use the tool. If
you intend to configure a firewall, be sure to ask around and
get as much advice from sources you consider reliable and get
someone to test/sanity check your configuration from the outside.

seem an odd thing to do if you've never seen an application of it before.
Ok, here are a couple of common places where it is used: Mobile-IP and
IP-Multicast. What is perhaps the most widely spread use of it though is
also the least well known, Amateur Radio.

<P>"But why ?". Ok, ok. Conventional IP routing rules mandate that an IP network
comprises a network address and a network mask. This produces a series of
contiguous addresses that may all be routed via a single routing entry.
This is very convenient, but it means that you may only use any particular
IP address while you are connected to the particular piece of network to which
it belongs. In most instances this is ok, but if you are a mobile netizen then
you may not be able to stay connected to the one place all the time. IP/IP
encapsulation (IP tunneling) allows you to overcome this restriction by
allowing datagrams destined for your IP address to be wrapped up and redirected
to another IP address. If you know that you're going to be operating from some
other IP network for some time you can set up a machine on your home network
to accept datagrams to your IP address and redirect them to the address that
you will actually be using temporarily.

The diagram illustrates another possible reason to use IPIP encapsulation,
virtual private networking. This example presupposes that you have two machines
each with a simple dial up internet connection. Each host is allocated just
a single IP address. Behind each of these machines are some private local area
networks configured with reserved IP network addresses. Suppose that you want
to allow any host on network A to connect to any host on network B, just as
if they were properly connected to the Internet with a network route. IPIP
encapsulation will allow you to do this. Note, encapsulation does not solve
the problem of how you get the hosts on networks A and B to talk to any
other on the Internet, you still need tricks like IP Masquerade for that.
Encapsulation is normally performed by machine functioning as routers.

<P>This sort of configuration is more typical of a Mobile-IP application. Where
a single host wants to roam around the Internet and maintain a single usable
IP address the whole time. You should refer to the Mobile-IP section for more
information on how that is handled in practice.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 IP Masquerade</A>
</H2>

<P>Many people have a simple dialup account to connect to the Internet. Nearly
everybody using this sort of configuration is allocated a single IP address
by the Internet Service Provider. This is normally enough to allow only one
host full access to the network. IP Masquerade is a clever trick that enables
you to have many machines make use of that one IP address, by causing the
other hosts to look like, hence the term masquerade, the machine supporting
the dialup connection. There is a small caveat and that is that the
masquerade function nearly always works only in one direction, that is the
masqueraded hosts can make calls out, but they cannot accept or receive
network connections from remote hosts. This means that some network services
do not work such as <EM>talk</EM> and others such as <EM>ftp</EM> must be configured
to operate in passive (PASV) mode to operate. Fortunately the most common
network services such as <EM>telnet</EM>, World Wide Web and <EM>irc</EM> do work
just fine.

this second network. Each of these hosts would have the IP address of the

run a service on that port, you could forward telnet connections, log
them or do whatever fits your need.
<P>A more interesting example is redirecting all <CODE>http</CODE> traffic
through a local cache. However, the protocol used by proxy servers is
different from native http: where a client connects to
<CODE>www.server.com:80</CODE> and asks for <CODE>/path/page</CODE>, when it
connects to the local cache it contacts <CODE>proxy.local.domain:8080</CODE>
and asks for <CODE>www.server.com/path/page</CODE>.
<P>To filter an <CODE>http</CODE> request through the local proxy, you need to
adapt the protocol by inserting a small server, called
<CODE>transproxy</CODE> (you can find it on the world wide web). You can choose
to run <CODE>transproxy</CODE> on port 8081, and issue this command:

after fixing protocol differences.

changes its point of connectivity it must also change its IP address.
IP Mobility overcomes this problem by allocating a fixed IP address to the

it is currently using.
