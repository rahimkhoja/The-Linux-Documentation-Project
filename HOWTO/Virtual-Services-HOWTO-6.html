<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Syslogd</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Problem</A>
</H2>

<P>Syslogd is the system logging utility commonly used on UNIX systems.  Syslogd
is a daemon that opens a special file called a FIFO.  A FIFO is a special file 
that acts like a pipe.  Anything that is written to the write side will come out 
the read side.  Syslogd waits for data from the read side.  There
are C functions that write to the write side.  If your program uses these C 
functions your output will go to syslogd.  
<P>
<P>Remember that we have used a <CODE> chroot </CODE> environment and the FIFO that 
syslogd is reading from (/dev/log) is not present.  That means all the virtual 
environments will not log to syslogd.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Solution</A>
</H2>

<H3>Setup Links</H3>

<P> 
Syslogd can look to a different FIFO if you tell it on the command 
line so run syslogd with the argument:
<P>
<PRE>
syslogd -p /virtual/log
</PRE>
<P>Then symlink /dev/log to /virtual/log by: 
<P>
<PRE>
ln -sf /virtual/log /dev/log
</PRE>
<P>Then hard link all the /dev/log copies to this file by running: 
<P>
<PRE>
ln -f /virtual/log /virtual/domain1.com/dev/log 
</PRE>
<P>The virtfs script above already does this.  Since /virtual is one contiguous
disk and the /dev/log's are hard linked they have the same inode number and point 
to the same data.  The <CODE> chroot </CODE> cannot stop this so all your 
virtual /dev/log's will now function.  Note that all the messages from all 
the environments will be logged in one place.  However, you can write separate 
programs to filter out the data.  
<P>
<H3>Syslogd.init</H3>

<P>This version of the syslogd.init file hard links the /dev/log's each time 
you start it because syslogd deletes and creates the /dev/log FIFO each 
time it runs.  Here is a modified syslogd.init file:
<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions

case "$1" in
  start)
        echo -n "Starting dev log: "
        ln -sf /virtual/log /dev/log
        echo done
        echo -n "Starting system loggers: "
        daemon syslogd -p /virtual/log
        daemon klogd
        echo
        echo -n "Starting virtual dev log: "
        for i in /virtual/*
        do
                if [ ! -d "$i" ]
                then
                        continue
                fi
                if [ "$i" = "/virtual/lost+found" ]
                then
                        continue
                fi
                ln -f /virtual/log $i/dev/log
                echo -n "."
        done
        echo " done"
        touch /var/lock/subsys/syslogd
        ;;
  stop)
        echo -n "Shutting down system loggers: "
        killproc syslogd
        killproc klogd
        echo
        rm -f /var/lock/subsys/syslogd
        ;;
  *)
        echo "Usage: syslogd {start|stop}"
        exit 1
esac

exit 0

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Multiple Syslogd's </A>
</H2>

<H3>One Per Disk</H3>

<P>If you run out of space on one filesystem and you have to break up your virtual
domains onto different disks remember that hard links will not cross disks.  That
means you will have to run a separate syslogd for each group of domains on a disk. 
For example, if you had thirteen domains on /virtual1 and fifteen domains on 
/virtual2, you would hard link thirteen domains to /virtual1/log and run one 
syslogd with <CODE> syslogd -p /virtual1/log </CODE> and hard link fifteen other domains 
to /virtual2/log with a syslogd running with <CODE> syslogd -p /virtual2/log </CODE>. 
<P>
<H3>One Per Domain</H3>

<P>If you do not want to centralize the logs to one place you could also run
one syslogd per domain.  This wastes process ID's so I do not recommend it but it
is easier to implement.   You would have to alter your syslogd.init file to
run syslogd as <CODE> chroot /virtual/domain1.com syslogd </CODE> for each domain.  
This will run each syslogd within the <CODE> chroot </CODE> and the logs will be in 
/virtual/domain1.com/var/log rather than all combined in /var/log.  
Do not forget to run a syslogd normally <CODE> syslogd </CODE> for the
main system and a kernel logger <CODE> klogd </CODE>.
