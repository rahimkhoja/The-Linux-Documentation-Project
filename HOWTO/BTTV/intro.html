>1. Introduction</H1
><P
> This document was written to assist the reader in setting up and
configuring TV tuner cards based on the Bt848 or Bt878 chipsets in the Linux
operating system.

It outlines how to enable the necessary kernel and/or software support and
various television applications and software methods of capture usable with your device.

While there is some attempt to catalog individual cards and features in <A
HREF="mfgr.html"
>Appendix C</A
>, 
the ultimate best source of information about your card and its capabilities will be 
found in the printed manual that came with your device or the manufacturer's website.</P

>1.6. Conventions Used in this Document</H2
><P
> The following conventions are used in this document and are
outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete understanding
of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux, 
which is usually via the Bash shell.  </P
><P
> First, filenames are referenced in a paragraph like so:
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/path/file</TT
> </P
><P
> Commands in Linux are executed (or 'called') at the command prompt,
otherwise known as the 'command line.'

If you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment, you will usually
be presented with the Bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: </P

'superuser' privileges.

You can also access the Bash shell in the X window
system, otherwise known as X or X11, with an <A

TARGET="_top"
>xterm</A
> or similar
X-terminal-emulator.

Commands to be performed at the Bash prompt, but referenced in a paragraph
of this document, usually look like this: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>do this now</B
></P
><P
> Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be
outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading: </P

>	When a command is written in front of the Bash prompt (e.g.,
	<B

>$ date</B

	or [Enter] key has been pressed after the command, possibly
	followed by the output on a new line as shown in the preceding example.</P
