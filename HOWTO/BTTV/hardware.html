>If you haven't figured it out by now, this document deals with the Linux-specific 
configuration of frame grabber cards that include the 
<A
HREF="http://www.conexant.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Conexant</A
> Bt848 and related family
of video decoder chips, collectively referred to as the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Bt8x8"</SPAN
> chipset. 
You can probably see the Bt8x8 chip (it's usually labelled as such) embedded on your 
TV card upon inspection, in addition to other chips which you should probably make note of 
before installation in case there are problems later.
The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Bt"</SPAN
> stands for Brooktree, after the original manufacturer of 
the chipset, now a part of Conexant. The Bt8x8 family has enjoyed remarkable longevity in a world where
<A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law"
TARGET="_top"
>Moore's Law</A
> is the rule,
the first ISA boards manufactured in the mid-1990s. There are several chips in this family, including the Bt848, 
Bt848A, Bt849, Bt878 and Bt879, and as a rule are all supported by the 
<A
HREF="http://linux.bytesex.org/v4l2/bttv.html"
TARGET="_top"
>BTTV driver</A
> for which 
this document is named.</P
><P
>In addition to the Bt8x8 decoder chip, these cards vary by accompanying components such as the tuner and sound decoder, and may include an optional videotext decoder, radio tuner, and/or hardware mpeg encoder.</P
><P
>Note that the next generation of bt8x8, the 
<A
HREF="http://linux.bytesex.org/v4l2/cx88.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Conexant 2388x</A
>, is now supported by a driver in the Linux 2.6 kernel. The configuration 
of hardware with that chipset is beyond the scope of this document (but similar).</P
><P
>In general, any PCI card with a Bt8x8 chipset should work with the Linux Bttv driver.

An example of such output for a Bt8x8 card might look similar to the following:

>2.2. The Sound Output</H2
><P
>Your card may have come with a short external audio connector with two male ends. 
This is for connecting your Bttv audio out to your sound card's input jack so you 
won't require an extra set of speakers. Some cards may also have a 4-pin socket for 
output of your Bt8x8 audio signals directly to your sound card within your computer 
case. You can connect this to your "CDROM" input with reasonable certainty that you 
will be able to control the input with your mixer from your primary sound card as 
well as record (see <A
HREF="recording.html"
>Appendix D</A
> for more information on recording). 
Alternatively you can use external speakers connected to the line out of your Bt8x8 card.</P
