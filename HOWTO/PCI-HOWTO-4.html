Saturn I:  these are revisions 1 and 2 of the Saturn chipsets.
Saturn II:  This is also called rev. 4 of the Saturn chipsets.
 
As far as I know, rev. 3 never actually shipped, and (from a few people who
have it) the SP3G now has rev. 4 (or Saturn II) in it. 
 
Confused?  Well, the only real definitive answer is to get ahold of the board
and run the debug script in the PCI chipset list on it.  As far as I know, 
though, the SP3G board is indeed shipping with rev. 4 (Saturn II).
