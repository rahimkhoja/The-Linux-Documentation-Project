configuring a webcam, digital camera, or other video device in the Linux
operating system.

It outlines how to enable the necessary kernel and/or software support and
various frame-grabber applications that can be used to access your device.

It does not discuss the differences in graphic and video formats, the
features and/or capabilities of particular devices, or the encoding or
conversion of video formats.</P

>1.6. Conventions Used in this Document</H2
><P
> The following conventions are used in this document and are
outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete understanding
of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux,
which is usually via the Bash shell.  </P
><P
> First, filenames are referenced in a paragraph like so:
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/path/file</TT
> </P
><P
> Commands in Linux are executed (or 'called') at the command prompt,
otherwise known as the 'command line.'

If you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment, you will usually
be presented with the Bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: </P

'superuser' privileges.

You can also access the Bash shell in the X window
system, otherwise known as X or X11, with an <A

>xterm</A
> or similar
X-terminal-emulator.

Commands to be performed at the Bash prompt, but referenced in a paragraph
of this document, usually look like this: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>do this now</B
></P
><P
> Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be
outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading: </P

>	When a command is written in front of the Bash prompt (e.g.,
	<B

>$ date</B

	or [Enter] key has been pressed after the command, possibly
	followed by the output on a new line (e.g., as in the date in
	the above example).  </P
