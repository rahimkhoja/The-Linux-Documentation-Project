<P>This Mini-HOWTO has been largely derived from the Swap-Space Mini HOWTO by
<B>H. Peter Anvin</B>. Rahul.U.Joshi added the Windows 95/98 specific details as 
well as a few Red Hat Linux specific details. The msinfo program given in the 
original HOWTO didn't work on the Joshi's Red Hat Linux 6 system, so he created a similar  
program. However, He has also included the original msinfo program.It is now maintained by 
Rahul Sundaram.
<P>I rely on you, the readers, to make this HOWTO useful. If you have any
suggestions, comments, corrections, requests, flames, etc., feel free to
contact
