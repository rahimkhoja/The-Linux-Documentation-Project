> This document was written to assist the Linux user in setting up their cable
modem, and includes information on configuring a DHCP client, enabling the device
with or without USB support and troubleshooting. I have successfully configured
Motorola and Toshiba brand cable modems with the methods herein, and others have
informed me that the configuration methods of other manufacturers' hardware is almost
identical. A mostly-complete laundry list of hardware specific tidbits is addressed
in <A

some specific informtion that you think will be helpful, please send it along via the

>1.6. Conventions Used in this Document</H2
><P
> The following conventions are
used in this document and are outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete
understanding of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux,
which is almost always the bash shell.</P
><P
> First, filenames are referenced in
a paragraph like so: <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/path/file</TT
></P
><P
> Commands in Linux are
executed (or 'called') at the command prompt, otherwise known as the 'command line.' If
you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment you will usually be presented
the bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: <TABLE

>...if you have logged in as root or have acquired root, or 'superuser'
privileges. You can also access the bash shell in the X window system, otherwise known
as X or X11, with an <A

>xterm</A
>
or similar X-terminal-emulator. Commands to be performed at the bash prompt, but
referenced in a paragraph of this document, usually look like this: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>do this
now</B
></P
><P
> Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be
outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading:</P

></TABLE
></P
><P
>When a command is written in
front of the bash prompt (e.g. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>$ date</B
> above), it is assumed the
[Return] or [Enter] key has been depressed after the command, possibly followed by
the output (e.g., the date).</P
