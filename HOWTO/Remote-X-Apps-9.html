<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Setting Up an X Terminal</A></H2>

<P>Make use of your old PC!  Turn it into an extra work place!  No need
for buying expensive new hardware!  You've already got all it takes!
<P>
<P>Seriously, you can set up an old PC as an X terminal.  An X terminal
is a computer that basically runs nothing but an X server.  You can log
in on it, and get an X session, with xterms, xbiff, xclock, every other
conceivable X client.  However, all clients are running on a remote host,
and are using remote X to display their output on your local X terminal.
Even the window manager is running remotely.
<P>
<P>An X terminal takes very few resources, compared to a full blown unix
machine.  Over here I have an X terminal with a 486 CPU, 16M of RAM,
and 250M of disk space.  Oh, and a network connection, of course.
It doesn't even have user home directories.
<P>
<P>For some related reading, have a look at:

This document is an extensive description of what is possible with
XDMCP and xdm, applied for building X terminals.  Definitely have
a look at this.

This document describes the steps necessary to set up xdm for use
with remote X servers, such as from X terminals.  The setup of the

<P>Contrasted to the above documents, this document (the Remote X Apps
mini-HOWTO) limits itself to a short description of XDMCP, but puts more
emphasis on the security issues involved.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Once More, a Little Theory First</A>
</H2>

<P>As far as X is concerned, the X terminal will be running nothing but an
X server.  This X server will be configured to talk to a remote host
using XDMCP (the X Display Manager Control Protocol).  It will ask
the remote host for an X session.  The remote host will put up a login
window on the X terminal, and after login it will run an X session with
all bells and whistles, including the window manager, all using remote
X to display on the X terminal.
<P>
<P>You will probably notice that the remote host is acting like a server,
though not an X server.  The remote host is providing X sessions to X
servers that ask for one.  So, with respect to XDMCP, the remote host is
actually a server, providing X sessions, also known as an XDMCP server.
The X server is playing the role of an XDMCP client!  Are you still
with me?
<P>
<P>The program that provides the XDMCP service on the XDMCP server is
<CODE>xdm</CODE>.  So, in order to get an X terminal up and running, you must
configure two programs: <CODE>X</CODE> (the XDMCP client) on the X terminal,
and xdm (the XDMCP server) on the remote host.
<P>
<P>You must always remember that the X protocol (and the XDMCP protocol)
are not encrypted.  If you use remote X, everything that goes over the
network can be sniffed by other hosts on the network.  This is especially
bad with remote X sessions, since the first thing that happens is logging
in by giving a username and password.  So, you must run remote X over
a trusted network only!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Configuring <CODE>X</CODE> as an XDMCP Client</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to set up a Linux machine as an X terminal, you need very
few resources.  Basically, you need what it takes to get a bare bones
Linux machine running, plus an X server.  Specifically, you do <EM>not</EM>
need the X clients and libraries.  It can be useful to install some X
fonts, but you can also use a font server somewhere on the network.
<P>
<P>There are a few ways for an X server to get an X session from an XDMCP
server.  The simplest one is to go straight to a known XDMCP server and
ask for one.  Alternatively, the X server can broadcast a request for
an XDMCP service and use the first XDMCP server that responds.  Lastly,
the X server can go to an XDMCP server, ask it for a list of hosts
willing to provide a session, and let the user choose a session host.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>When you know the host that is going to provide you with sessions,
go straight to it.  Run
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
X -query sessionhost
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and, assuming <CODE>xdm</CODE> is running on <CODE>sessionhost</CODE>, you'll get a
login window, and after login, an X session.
</LI>
<LI>When you don't really care on which host you're getting your session,
use the broadcast method.  Run
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
X -broadcast
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and, assuming <CODE>xdm</CODE> is running somewhere on the network, you'll get
a login window from the first (and hopefully quickest) <CODE>xdm</CODE> that
responds, and after login, an X session.
</LI>
<LI>When you want to choose the host where you want to have your session,
ask an XDMCP server for a list.  Run
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
X -indirect xdmcpserver
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and, assuming <CODE>xdm</CODE> is configured right there, you'll be presented a
list of hosts to choose from.  Choose one; you'll get the login window
for that host, and after login, the session you were looking for.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>You may have noticed the absence of the <CODE>-auth</CODE> option.  The X
server will use XDMCP to negotiate a magic cookie with the XDMCP server.
The XDMCP server will put the cookie in your remote <CODE>~/.Xauthority</CODE>
after login.
<P>
<P>After a session is over, the X server will loop and go back to the
original XDMCP server and ask for another session (or chooser list).
If you don't want that, you can use the <CODE>-once</CODE> option.  Note:
this doesn't seem to work with the <CODE>-indirect</CODE> option due to the
implementation of the chooser.
<P>
<P>When you have determined the way in which you want to run the
X server, you can also put it in a startup script, or even run
it straight from <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>.  Please consult your own
distribution's documentation for how to modify your startup scripts
or <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Do <EM>not</EM> run an X server like this from the <CODE>Xservers</CODE> configuration
file.  <CODE>xdm</CODE> expects to be able to connect to such servers, and may
kill them if it can't connect.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Configuring <CODE>xdm</CODE> as an XDMCP Server</A>
</H2>

<P>The program that provides the XDMCP service (the session service) is
usually <CODE>xdm</CODE>.  There are variants of this such as <CODE>wdm</CODE> or <CODE>gdm</CODE>
on Linux, but these basically work the same way.  So, make sure <CODE>xdm</CODE>
or variant is installed on the host where you want to run your X sessions.
If you've got a local graphical login on the X session host, <CODE>xdm</CODE>
is already installed; most Linux distributions come that way these days.
<P>
<P>In addition to <CODE>xdm</CODE>, you will need the programs that you wish to be
able to run in an X session.  That is, all X clients like <CODE>xterm</CODE>,
<CODE>xfig</CODE>, <CODE>xclock</CODE>, window managers and all that.  However, for an
XDMCP server, you do <EM>not</EM> have to install an X server; the X server
will be running on the X terminal instead.
<P>
<P>From the X server story above, you can conclude that there are
basically two kinds of XDMCP service.  There is the <EM>direct</EM> service,
consisting of letting an XDMCP client log in, and then providing it
with an X session.  Alternatively, there is the <EM>indirect</EM> service,
in which an XDMCP client is provided with a list of hosts, providing a
direct service, to choose from.
<P>
<P>All <CODE>xdm</CODE> services are configured in the access file, generally
located at <CODE>/etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess</CODE> or a similar location.  This
location is actually defined in the general <CODE>xdm</CODE> configuration file
<CODE>/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config</CODE>, through the <CODE>accessFile</CODE> resource.
See your <CODE>xdm</CODE> manual for the default location.
<P>
<OL>
<LI><P>If you want to allow <CODE>xdm</CODE> to provide connecting XDMCP clients with an
X session, whether by broadcast or not, you put the host name of the XDMCP
client (the X server, remember?) by itself on a line in <CODE>Xaccess</CODE>.
Actually, you can put a pattern on the line matching multiple hosts.
Here are some valid patterns:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xterm023.my.domain      # xterm023.my.domain can get an X session
*.my.domain             # any host in my.domain can get an X session
*                       # any host on Internet can get an X session (unsafe)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Whether you should want to provide any host in Internet with an X
session is arguable.  Obviously, any service you provide is one more
possible hole in your server's security.  On the other hand, the server
should be secure itself, and an XDMCP client asking for an X session
has to provide a valid authentication before the X session is granted.
<P>
<P>Furthermore, the X session uses a remote X connection, which is
not encrypted.  The username/password pair for the login will be
transported on this connection.  People out there could be sniffing valid
username/password combinations, just as with plain telnet connections.
This is even worse then having xauth magic cookies sniffed.
<P>
<P>Make your own decisions here, but I recommend not enabling this service
to the world unless you have a good reason.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><P>If you want to provide XDMCP clients (<CODE>X -indirect xdmcpserver</CODE>) with a
chooser list (a list of hosts to choose from to get an X session), follow
the client pattern with the keyword <CODE>CHOOSER</CODE> and the list of hosts
that that client may choose from.  Instead of the list of hosts to choose
from, you can also specify <CODE>BROADCAST</CODE>; with this, <CODE>xdm</CODE> broadcasts
on the network to query for servers willing to provide the session.  Some valid examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xterm023.my.domain      CHOOSER seshost1 seshost2
*.my.domain             CHOOSER BROADCAST
*                       CHOOSER extseshost1 extseshost2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The first lets <CODE>xterm023</CODE> choose between sessions on either
<CODE>seshost1</CODE> and <CODE>seshost2</CODE>.  The second lets any host in
<CODE>my.domain</CODE> choose from any host that is willing to provide an
X session.  The third lets any host out there choose between a session
on <CODE>extseshost1</CODE> or <CODE>etsseshost2</CODE>.
<P>
<P>It is probably not a good idea to do <CODE>* CHOOSER BROADCAST</CODE>.  This will
allow hosts outside your network to get information about the hosts inside
your network.  You probably don't want to pass out such information.
In fact, allowing a chooser to any outside host is probably not useful
anyway, since you should not be enabling arbitrary direct connections
either.
<P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>When you have reconfigured <CODE>xdm</CODE>, send it the <CODE>HUP</CODE> signal to make
it re-read its configuration files.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# kill -HUP pid-of-xdm
#

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 XDMCP Technically</A>
</H2>

<P>Technically, as far as I can see, XDMCP is not entirely what you would
expect from the above description.  <CODE>xdm</CODE> can redirect connecting X
servers to another place, and uses this trick to implement the chooser.
So, the choosing happens inside xdm, not in the X server, although the
chooser list is represented on the X server's display.  This is also
why the X server's <CODE>-once</CODE> option does not combine with <CODE>-indirect</CODE>.
