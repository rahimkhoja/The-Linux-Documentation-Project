There is wealth of information one should go through when setting up a
major system, for instance for a news or general Internet service provider. 
The FAQs in the following groups are useful:

Some of the most interesting news groups are:

<P>Most newsgroups have their own FAQ that are designed to answer most of your
questions, as the name Frequently Asked Questions indicate. Fresh versions
should be posted regularly to the relevant newsgroups. If you cannot find it
in your news spool you could go directly to the

<H2><A NAME="ss16.2">16.2 Mailing Lists</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!mailing lists
-->

These are low noise channels mainly for developers. Think
twice before asking questions there as noise delays the development.
Some relevant lists are <CODE>linux-raid</CODE>, <CODE>linux-scsi</CODE> and <CODE>linux-ext2fs</CODE>.
Many of the most useful mailing lists run on the <CODE>vger.rutgers.edu</CODE> server
but this is notoriously overloaded, so try to find a mirror. There are some lists mirrored at
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">The Redhat Home Page</A>.
Many lists are also accessible at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/">linuxhq</A>,
and the rest of the web site is a gold mine of useful information.
<P>If you want to find out more about the lists available you can send a message
with the line <CODE>lists</CODE> to the list server at vger.rutgers.edu (
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A>).
If you need help on how to use the mail server just send the line <CODE>help</CODE>
to the same address.
Due to the popularity of this server it is likely it takes a bit to time before
you get a reply or even get messages after you send a <CODE>subscribe</CODE> command.
<P>There is also a number of other majordomo list servers that can be of interest
such as the EATA driver list (
<A HREF="mailto:linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de">linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de</A>)
and the Intelligent IO list
<A HREF="mailto:linux-i2o@dpt.com">linux-i2o@dpt.com</A>.
<P>Mailing lists are in a state of flux but you can find links to a number of
interesting lists from the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Homepage</A>.

<H2><A NAME="ss16.3">16.3 HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!HOWTOs
-->

These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <CODE>Bootdisk</CODE>, <CODE>Installation</CODE>,  <CODE>SCSI</CODE> and <CODE>UMSDOS</CODE>.
The main site for these is the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">LDP archive</A>.
<P>There is a a new HOWTO out that deals with setting up a
DPT RAID system, check out the
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/dpt_raid.html">DPT RAID HOWTO homepage</A>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss16.4">16.4 Mini-HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!mini-HOWTOs
-->

These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<CODE>Backup-With-MSDOS</CODE>, <CODE>Diskless</CODE>, <CODE>LILO</CODE>, <CODE>Large Disk</CODE>,
<CODE>Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+OS2+DOS</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+Win95</CODE>,
<CODE>NFS-Root</CODE>, <CODE>Win95+Win+Linux</CODE>, <CODE>ZIP Drive</CODE> .
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <CODE>mini</CODE>. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.
<P>The old <CODE>Linux Large IDE mini-HOWTO</CODE> is no longer valid, instead read
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/README.ide</CODE> or
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/ide.txt</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss16.5">16.5 Local Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!local

In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc">/usr/doc</A> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO">/usr/doc/HOWTO</A>)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini</A>)
of plain text documents.
<P>Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<A HREF="file:///etc">/etc</A>
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<A HREF="file:///etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</A>
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<A HREF="file:///etc/mdtab">/etc/mdtab</A>
file that is used for the <CODE>md</CODE> system to set up RAID.
<P>The kernel source in
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux">/usr/src/linux</A>
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <EM>use the source, Luke</EM>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation">documentation directory</A>.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.
<P>Also have a look in your system log file (
<A HREF="file:///var/log/messages">/var/log/messages</A>)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <CODE>tail -f /var/log/messages</CODE>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.
<P>You can also take advantage of the 
<A HREF="file:///proc">/proc</A>
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <CODE>cat</CODE> rather than <CODE>more</CODE> to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <CODE>less</CODE> works well here.

<!--
disk!information resources!web pages

There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.
<P>A good starting point is of course the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Homepage</A>.
that is a information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.

could have a look at the

These drivers are in the 2.1.x kernel development series as well as
in 2.0.34 and later.

<P>For diagrams and information on all sorts of disk drives, controllers etc. both

<!--

<!--
disk!information resources!Troubleshooting mini-HOWTO
-->

<!--
disk!information resources!Updated mini-HOWTO

<P>When all fails try the internet search engines. There is a huge number
of them, all a little different from each other. It falls outside the
scope of this HOWTO to describe how best to use them. Instead you
could turn to the Troubleshooting on the Internet mini-HOWTO, and the
Updated mini-HOWTO.
<P>
<P>If you have to ask for help you are most likely to get help in the
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.setup">Linux Setup</A>
news group.
Due to large workload and a slow network connection I am not able to
follow that newsgroup so if you want to contact me you have to do so
by e-mail.
