This section describes the different technologies used to build your own Linux VCR.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Tuner or Capture Card</A>
</H2>

<P>You will need to install a supported video4linux capture card in your computer.  I currently use the Hauppauge
WinTV tuner card which I purchased from Best Buy, but many other cards should work just as well.  I don't have
a suggestion for which is best, I can only comment that the one I own works for me.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Kernel video4linux driver</A>
</H2>

<P>Many GNU/Linux distributions already provide a Linux kernel that is configured to support video4linux devices.
The Hauppauge WinTV card is supported by the 'bttv' driver.  I have to load two modules into the linux kernel
to support my card, namely the 'tuner' and 'bttv' modules.  Check out the 
<A HREF="http://roadrunner.swansea.linux.org.uk/v4l.shtml">V4L homepage</A> for details on
supported tuner cards.  Also check out 
<A HREF="http://lhd.zdnet.com/db/searchproduct.cgi?_catid=17">ZDnet Linux Hardware</A> for
information about Linux tuner cards.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Frame Capture Software</A>
</H2>

<P>Recording with your digital VCR of course requires frame capture software.  As I become aware of available software
for capturing audio/video to mpeg/avi formats, I will place it in this list.  If you have any suggestions for good
software please let me know and I'll add it here.
