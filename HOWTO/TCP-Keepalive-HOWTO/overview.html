>&#13;    In order to understand what TCP keepalive (which we will just call
    keepalive) does, you need do nothing more than read the name: keep TCP
    alive. This means that you will be able to check your connected socket (also
    known as TCP sockets), and determine whether the connection is still up and
    running or if it has broken.

>2.1. What is TCP keepalive?</H2
><P
>&#13;      The keepalive concept is very simple: when you set up a TCP connection,
      you associate a set of timers. Some of these timers deal with the
      keepalive procedure. When the keepalive timer reaches zero, you send your
      peer a keepalive probe packet with no data in it and the ACK flag turned
      on. You can do this because of the TCP/IP specifications, as a sort of
      duplicate ACK, and the remote endpoint will have no arguments, as TCP is a
      stream-oriented protocol. On the other hand, you will receive a reply from
      the remote host (which doesn't need to support keepalive at all, just
      TCP/IP), with no data and the ACK set.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you receive a reply to your keepalive probe, you can assert that the
      connection is still up and running without worrying about the user-level
      implementation. In fact, TCP permits you to handle a stream, not packets,
      and so a zero-length data packet is not dangerous for the user program.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This procedure is useful because if the other peers lose their connection
      (for example by rebooting) you will notice that the connection is broken,
      even if you don't have traffic on it. If the keepalive probes are not
      replied to by your peer, you can assert that the connection cannot be
      considered valid and then take the correct action.

>2.2. Why use TCP keepalive?</H2
><P
>&#13;      You can live quite happily without keepalive, so if you're reading this,
      you may be trying to understand if keepalive is a possible solution for
      your problems. Either that or you've really got nothing more interesting
      to do instead, and that's okay too. :)
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Keepalive is non-invasive, and in most cases, if you're in doubt, you can
      turn it on without the risk of doing something wrong. But do remember that
      it generates extra network traffic, which can have an impact on routers
      and firewalls.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In short, use your brain and be careful.
    </P

>2.3. Checking for dead peers</H2
><P
>&#13;      Keepalive can be used to advise you when your peer dies before it is able
      to notify you. This could happen for several reasons, like kernel panic or
      a brutal termination of the process handling that peer. Another scenario
      that illustrates when you need keepalive to detect peer death is when the
      peer is still alive but the network channel between it and you has gone
      down. In this scenario, if the network doesn't become operational again,
      you have the equivalent of peer death. This is one of those situations
      where normal TCP operations aren't useful to check the connection status.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Think of a simple TCP connection between Peer A and Peer B: there is the
      initial three-way handshake, with one SYN segment from A to B, the SYN/ACK
      back from B to A, and the final ACK from A to B. At this time, we're in a
      stable status: connection is established, and now we would normally wait
      for someone to send data over the channel. And here comes the problem:
      unplug the power supply from B and instantaneously it will go down,
      without sending anything over the network to notify A that the connection
      is going to be broken. A, from its side, is ready to receive data, and has
      no idea that B has crashed. Now restore the power supply to B and wait for
      the system to restart. A and B are now back again, but while A knows about
      a connection still active with B, B has no idea. The situation resolves
      itself when A tries to send data to B over the dead connection, and B
      replies with an RST packet, causing A to finally to close the connection.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Keepalive can tell you when another peer becomes unreachable without the
      risk of false-positives. In fact, if the problem is in the network between
      two peers, the keepalive action is to wait some time and then retry,
      sending the keepalive packet before marking the connection as broken.

>2.4. Preventing disconnection due to network inactivity</H2
><P
>&#13;      The other useful goal of keepalive is to prevent inactivity from
      disconnecting the channel. It's a very common issue, when you are behind a
      NAT proxy or a firewall, to be disconnected without a reason. This
      behavior is caused by the connection tracking procedures implemented in
      proxies and firewalls, which keep track of all connections that pass
      through them. Because of the physical limits of these machines, they can
      only keep a finite number of connections in their memory. The most common
      and logical policy is to keep newest connections and to discard old and
      inactive connections first.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Returning to Peers A and B, reconnect them. Once the channel is open, wait
      until an event occurs and then communicate this to the other peer. What if
      the event verifies after a long period of time? Our connection has its
      scope, but it's unknown to the proxy. So when we finally send data, the
      proxy isn't able to correctly handle it, and the connection breaks up.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Because the normal implementation puts the connection at the top of the
      list when one of its packets arrives and selects the last connection in
      the queue when it needs to eliminate an entry, periodically sending
      packets over the network is a good way to always be in a polar position
      with a minor risk of deletion.
