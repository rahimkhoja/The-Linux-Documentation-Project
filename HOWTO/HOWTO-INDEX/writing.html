>Chapter 8. Writing and Submitting a HOWTO</H1
><P
>If you are interested in writing or maintaining a HOWTO, 
please contact us <EM
>FIRST</EM
> at
<EM
><A
HREF="mailto:feedback@en.tldp.org"
TARGET="_top"
>feedback@en.tldp.org</A
></EM

If you want to maintain a unmaintained HOWTO, please try to contact
the former author.</P
><P
>Consult the <A
HREF="../../LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>LDP Author Guide</A
>
for detailed information on writing and submitting a HOWTO.</P
><P
>Here are a few general guidelines that you should follow when writing 
a HOWTO:</P
><P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Try to use meaningful structure and organization, and write clearly. 
Remember that many of the people reading HOWTOs do not speak English 
as their first language.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make sure that all of the information is correct. We can't stress 
this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that 
you're only guessing. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the available
software. Also, be sure to include full instructions on where software 
can be downloaded from (FTP site name, fullpathname), and the current 
version number and release date of the software.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Include an FAQ section at the end, if appropriate. Many HOWTO documents
need a ``FAQ'' or ``Common Problems'' section to cover information which
cannot be covered in the regular text.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>HOWTOs <EM
>should</EM
> be submitted to us in either
DocBook or linuxdoc SGML; or DocBook XML. 
Refer to the <A
HREF="../../LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>LDP Author Guide</A
> for further information.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Use other HOWTOs a model.  The SGML/XML source to the HOWTOs is available
on Linux FTP sites. In addition, examine the
<A
HREF="../../LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>LDP Author Guide</A
>,
the <A
HREF="../../manifesto.html"
TARGET="_top"
>LDP manifesto</A
> 
(and license guide), and the
<A
HREF="../../authors/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Authors Resources area</A
> of the LDP site.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make sure that your name, email address, date, and a version number 
is near the beginning of the document.  You could also include WWW
addresses and a postal mail address if you want.  The standard header is:
Title / Author's name and email address	/ Version number and date. 
For example:</P
><P
>The LDP Sample HOWTO by <EM
>various_authors</EM
> v6.1, 2001-05-01</P
><P
>Refer to the <A
HREF="../../LDP/LDP-Author-Guide/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>LDP Author Guide</A
> for further information.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Lastly, be prepared to receive questions and comments about your writing.
There are several hundreds of accesses to the HOWTO collection every day
from around the world.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>After you have written the HOWTO, mail the SGML source to us at <EM
><A
HREF="mailto:submit@en.tldp.org"
TARGET="_top"
>submit@en.tldp.org</A
></EM
>.</P
><P
>It is <EM
>important</EM
> that you go through us when submitting a
HOWTO, as we maintain the archives and need to keep track of what HOWTOs
are being written and who is doing what. </P
><P
>Please send the LDP periodic updates whenever appropriate.</P
