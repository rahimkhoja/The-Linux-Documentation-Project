>First, you need a running version of LRP - either build the disk yourself
or you can grab an image of mine at: 
<A
HREF="http://www.computechnology.com/pslave1440.img"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.computechnology.com/pslave1440.img</A
>.
This is a copy of my
working disk and you can directly write an image of it to your disk.
It will get you started. All you will then have to do is change to
the appropriate IP numbers and network card drivers. I won't get into
building a lrp disk here because there seems to be fairly good
documentation on that subject available.</P
><P
>Assuming you have your disk built, and you computer running, here is
what we need to do to configure your disk.</P
><P
>First, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>DELETE</I
> (yes, I said
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>DELETE</I
>) all <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>options.tty??</TT
>
files, the options file, and pap-secrets files located
under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp-radius</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp</TT
>. If you have an <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp</TT
>,
you probably installed <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ppp.lrp</TT
>. Also
remove <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ppp.lrp</TT
> from your disk and 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp</TT
> will go away.</P
><P
>Next, go to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/portslave</TT
> and adjust the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pslave.conf</TT
> file accordingly. I will now 
take you through that file line-by-line. I don't know what all of it
means but I made it work so you can to.</P

# Hostname of the system.
#
# This is my routers name. Your routers name will be different

conf.hostname hma2.cpty.net

#
# IP address - if left empty, uses the IP address of the system (hostname).
#
# This is used as the "local" address for SLIP and PPP connections.
# This is my routers IP address yours will be different use your routers
# IP number here

conf.ipno 10.0.0.4

#
# Lock directory - on FSSTND compliant systems it's /var/lock.
#
# No need to change this

conf.lockdir /var/lock

#
# Where to find the rlogin binary that accepts the "-i" flag.
#
# No need to change this

conf.rlogin /usr/bin/rlogin-radius

#
# Where to find our patched pppd that has radius linked in.
#
# No need to change this 

conf.pppd /usr/sbin/pppd-radius

#
# Where to find telnet. This can just be the system telnet.
#
# This can stay or go 

conf.telnet /usr/bin/telnet

#
# If you set this to "1", you can always login locally by putting a '!'
# before your loginname. Useful for emergencies when the RADIUS server is down.
# Make this either 0 or 1 as mentioned above

conf.locallogins 1

#
# Logging stuff - this program can use a remote syslog daemon if needed.
#
# If you want to log locally leave the "syslog" field empty. The facility
# field is an integer between 0 and 7 and sets the syslog facility to
# local0-local7.
#
# For now I log local to my router that is why I do not have anything 
# after syslog

conf.syslog 

conf.facility 6

#
# Stripnames - if you set this to "1", leading "P", "S", "C", "L" or "!"
# characters and trailing ".slip", ".cslip" and ".ppp" strings will be
# stripped from the username before it is recorded in the system
# utmp and wtmp files (if sysutmp or syswtmp are turned on of course)
#
# No need to change this

conf.stripnames 0


##
## The all entry is used as a template for all others. This means that
## setting all.debug to 0, you set s0.debug, s1.debug, s2.debug etc.
## to 0. It also means that all these settings can be overridden on a
## per-port basis below.
##
## The "all." stuff is the default for everything unless you specifically
## override it. I'll show you that at the end of this.


#
# Debugging output to syslog. Set to 0 or 1. "1" is pretty verbose.
# This can be 0 or 1. I like 1 because it gives lots of info

all.debug 1

#
# Authentication type - either "radius" or "none".
#
# Leave this as it is

all.authtype radius

#
# Authentication host and accounting host. We can have 2 of both. The
# first one is always tried three times before switching to the second one.
# They are alternately tried after that, up to maximum 10 times in total.
# Timeout is 5 seconds per query.

# your RADIUS servers clients file for the IP number or name of this router.

all.secret superagentman

# Default protocol and host. This is for rlogin sessions.
#
# Just change the all.host to the IP number of your router this should 
# match what you have at the top of this file

all.host 10.0.0.4

#
# Default IP stuff. If you end the "ipno" with a "+", the portnumber will
# be added to the IP number. The IP number of a port is used when the RADIUS
# server doesn't send an IP number, or if it tells us to use a dynamic ipno.
#
# Leave the netmask at 255.255.255.255, unless you really know what
# you're doing.
#
# This seemed a little confusing, but since I went with static IP numbers
# this was easy. I do not have "+" after my IP number because I directly
# assign the IP number to a MODEM at the end of this file.
#
# I modified the netmask to match that of my network. And I left MTU alone

## Tty names are s0...s63. For every port we need to define a tty port, and
## an IP number for when radius tells us to pick one ourself. Unless you
## use the IP pool option mentioned above (IP number with "+" appended).
##
## Note that you can change _all_ of the above settings that start
## with all.xxxx on a per-port basis, such as issue, prompt etc.
##
## This is where you can set options to a specific modem. sX.tty is
## for portslaves use you assign it to a real tty device.
## In the /etc/inittab you will see the lines portlsave 0 or 1 etc..
## this 0 or 1 is the tty device number portslave already knows it is
## "tty something" so all it requires is the last digits. 
##
## Since my modem is on COM 4 (DOS) that means s3.tty is ttyS3

s3.tty ttyS3

# Now I can set options for that modem
#
# Here is it's IP number statically assigned

s3.ipno 10.0.0.202

# Here is the protocol to use on that modem. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION HERE!
# This is the line that finally made portslave work perfectly for me.
# You must tie the ppp protocol to your modem. Simple huh?
