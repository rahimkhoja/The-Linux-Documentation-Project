>&#13;The intention behind this section is to allow you to get started with the Sybase-specific parts quickly. You will still need to know a little bit about relational databases, creating tables, designing the database and so on. You will see how to start and stop the server, execute commands and a little bit about backups.

>4.1. Starting and Stopping the Server</H2
><P
>&#13;Starting the server is done with the <B
CLASS="command"
>startserver</B
> utility. During installation a script file was created named <TT
CLASS="filename"
>RUN_</TT
> and then the name of the server. Since the file name will vary with your server name, it is generally referred to as the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>RUN_SERVER</TT
> file. To start your server, make sure all environment variables (in particular <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$SYBASE</TT
>) are set correctly. Check with <B
CLASS="command"
>showserver</B
> that the server is not already running -  there is no risk of starting the server twice, but you may get some confusing error messages about the master device already being in use. Assuming the server is not started, execute the following: <B
CLASS="command"
>startserver -f RUN_SYBASE</B
>Assuming that you named your server "SYBASE" at install time, this should make various messages starting with a timestamp scroll over your screen and hopefully end with messages about the default character set and sort order. If not, read the messages carefully for any errors. If they have scrolled out of your screen buffer you can read the error log file instead, located in the same directory as the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>RUN_SERVER</TT
> file.

>4.2. Connecting to the Server</H2
><P
>&#13;Once the server is up and running, you can attempt to connect to it. Start with the simplest tool, which is also the traditional utility for Sybase administration and use; <B
CLASS="command"
>isql</B
>. It takes many parameters, as listed in the Utility Guide, but we only need a few. Make your first connection like this: <B
CLASS="command"
>isql -Usa -P -S<TT
CLASS="replaceable"
><I
>server</I
></TT
></B
>Replace the <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>-S</I

> parameter with your logical server name that you chose during installation.

>&#13;The first thing to do is to set a password for "sa" and then create a new login with less privileges that we can use to play around with. By default you are placed in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>master</TT
> database once you are logged in. We will make our new login default to an example database instead to avoid creating objects in the master database by mistake. So, we first set a password for sa by calling the stored procedure <B
CLASS="command"
>sp_password</B
> with old and new passwords as parameters:

Now sa has a new password, changed from the old null default. We add a new login with <B

Since this is not a T-SQL command but a directive to isql we don't need to terminate with "go".
</P
><P
>&#13;The <B
CLASS="command"
>isql</B
> command can also be used non-interactively to apply scripts of T-SQL to the server. One such script that is shipped with the server is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>installpubs2</TT
>, located in the scripts directory. This is a very simple example database for a bookshop or a publishing house holding data about books, authors, publishers and so on. It is used in Sybase manuals and training courses and also in some SQL books. Microsoft SQL Server contains a similar database in addition to the Northwind example database they have added. In order to create the database, use the <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>-i</I
></TT
> parameter to read the script in. Have a look at the file first so you understand the basics of what it is doing; it will create a database named pubs2 and several tables populated with data. It is time to execute the script. We'll do this as sa who will also become the owner (dbo - database owner ) of the database. We redirect the output to a file we call <TT
CLASS="filename"
>errors.out</TT
>. The <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>-e</I
></TT
> parameter tells isql to also echo the T-SQL commands to the same file, giving more output but making it easier to match any errors to the commands causing them.

>4.5. Maintenance</H2
><P
>&#13;One of the most important aspects of being a database administrator may be the backup. The I/O load of a relational database means little rest for the hard drives and once a drive fails the database is in need of serious disaster recovery. Even a mistyped command may result in the need to revert to a previous backup generation. For this purpose, a separate server application called the Backup Server is used. It is by default named the same as your server with an extension of BCK. Start it with <B
CLASS="command"
>startserver -f RUN_SYBASE_BCK</B
>. Certain commands typed into the isql propmt will be forwarded from the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>dataserver</TT
> process to the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>backupserver</TT
> process, which will then proceed with the actual backup (in Sybase terminology, this is a database dump) while processing in the database continues unaffected. You should schedule database dumps (usually via cron) to run at low activity hours. A typical full database bacup is simply done like this:

'sp_volchanged' system stored procedure after fulfilling any volume change
request from the Backup Server.

You can restore this back into your database using the load database command.
</P
><P
>&#13;As time passes while users are doing modifications in the database, adding, deleting or changing data, all operations are being written to the transaction log. This keeps track of changes so they can be undone by an implicit or explicit rollback, or for the undo/redo phases of revocery at startup. This transaction log should normally be placed on a device of its own for several reasons, but a small test database can be created on a single mixed log and data device.
</P
><P
>&#13;Apart from the performance benefits of spreading I/O, one reason for keeping the log and data separate is for recovery purposes. You can at regular intervals, depending upon your recovery needs, dump this log of changes to the database. Together with the full database dump, this transaction log dump now constitute an incremental backup. Should a restore become necessary, you can load the database dump, then load all subsequent transaction log dumps. There is even an "until_time" option to the load command enabling you to specify the exact time you want to restore until, abandoning any mistakes done after that time. Dumping the log is done with a similar syntax:

Note that we could not do this with pubs2 as it was not created with a separate log fragment.
</P
><P
>&#13;Unless you keep dumping the transaction log, it will just keep growing until it fills up it's space and starts reporting error 1105. Users will be suspended and appear to be hanging while the situation remains unresolved. Dump the transaction log to file or tape, or simply truncate it if you don't use incremental backups.
