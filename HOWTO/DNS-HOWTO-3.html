<P><B>A first stab at DNS config, very useful for dialup, cable-modem, 
ADSL and similar users.</B>
<P>
<P>On Red Hat and Red Hat related distributions you can achieve the
same practical result as this HOWTO's first section by installing the
packages <CODE>bind</CODE>, <CODE>bind-utils</CODE> and <CODE>caching-nameserver</CODE>.  If
you use Debian simply install <CODE>bind</CODE> (or <CODE>bind9</CODE>, as of this
writing, BIND 9 is not supported by Debian Stable (potato)) and
<CODE>bind-doc</CODE>.  Of course just installing those packages won't teach
you as much as reading this HOWTO.  So install the packages, and then
read along verifying the files they installed.
<P>
<P>A caching only name server will find the answer to name queries and
remember the answer the next time you need it.  This will shorten the
waiting time the next time significantly, especially if you're on a
slow connection.
<P>
<P>First you need a file called <CODE>/etc/named.conf</CODE> (Debian:
<CODE>/etc/bind/named.conf</CODE>).  This is read when named starts.  For
now it should simply contain:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
// Config file for caching only name server
//
// The version of the HOWTO you read may contain leading spaces
// (spaces in front of the characters on these lines ) in this and
// other files.  You must remove them for things to work.
//
// Note that the filenames and directory names may differ, the
// ultimate contents of should be quite similar though.

options {
        directory "/var/named";

        // Uncommenting this might help if you have to go through a
        // firewall and things are not working out.  But you probably
        // need to talk to your firewall admin.

        // query-source port 53;
};

controls {
        inet 127.0.0.1 allow { localhost; } keys { rndc_key; };
};

key "rndc_key" {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "c3Ryb25nIGVub3VnaCBmb3IgYSBtYW4gYnV0IG1hZGUgZm9yIGEgd29tYW4K";
};

zone "." {
        type hint;
        file "root.hints";
};

zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "pz/127.0.0";
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The Linux distribution packages may use different file names for
each kind of file mentioned here; they will still contain about the
same things.
<P>
<P>The `<CODE>directory</CODE>' line tells named where to look for files.  All
files named subsequently will be relative to this.  Thus <CODE>pz</CODE>
is a directory under <CODE>/var/named</CODE>, i.e.,
<CODE>/var/named/pz</CODE>.  <CODE>/var/named</CODE> is the right directory
according to the <EM>Linux File system Standard</EM>.
<P>
<P>The file named <CODE>/var/named/root.hints</CODE> is named in this.
<CODE>/var/named/root.hints</CODE> should contain this:

</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The sections called <CODE>key</CODE> and <CODE>controls</CODE> together specify
that your named can be remotely controlled by a program called
<CODE>rndc</CODE> if it connects from the local host, and identifis itself
with the encoded secret key.  This key is like a password.  For rndc
to work you need <CODE>/etc/rndc.conf</CODE> to match this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
key rndc_key {
    algorithm "hmac-md5";
    secret "c3Ryb25nIGVub3VnaCBmb3IgYSBtYW4gYnV0IG1hZGUgZm9yIGEgd29tYW4K";
};

options {
    default-server localhost;
    default-key    rndc_key;
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>As you see the secret is identical.  If you want to use <CODE>rndc</CODE>
from other machines their times need to be within 5 minutes of
eachother.  I recommend using the ntp (<CODE>xntpd</CODE> and <CODE>ntpdate</CODE>)
software to do this.
<P>
<P>Next, you need a <CODE>/etc/resolv.conf</CODE> looking something like
this: (<EM>Again: Remove spaces!</EM>)
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu
nameserver 127.0.0.1
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The `<CODE>search</CODE>' line specifies what domains should be searched
for any host names you want to connect to.  The `<CODE>nameserver</CODE>' line
specifies the address of your nameserver, in this case your own
machine since that is where your named runs (127.0.0.1 is right, no
matter if your machine has another address too).  If you want to list
several name servers put in one `<CODE>nameserver</CODE>' line for
each. (Note: Named never reads this file, the resolver that uses named
does. Note 2: In some resolv.conf files you find a line saying
"domain".  That's fine, but don't use both "search" and "domain", only
one of them will work).
<P>
<P>To illustrate what this file does: If a client tries to look up
<CODE>foo</CODE>, then <CODE>foo.subdomain.your-domain.edu</CODE> is tried
first, then <CODE>foo.your-domain.edu</CODE>, and finally <CODE>foo</CODE>.
You may not want to put in too many domains in the search line, as it
takes time to search them all.
<P>
<P>The example assumes you belong in the domain
<CODE>subdomain.your-domain.edu</CODE>; your machine, then, is probably
called <CODE>your-machine.subdomain.your-domain.edu</CODE>.  The search
line should not contain your TLD (Top Level Domain, `<CODE>edu</CODE>' in this
case).  If you frequently need to connect to hosts in another domain
you can add that domain to the search line like this: (<EM>Remember to
remove the leading spaces, if any</EM>)
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
search subdomain.your-domain.edu your-domain.edu other-domain.com
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>and so on. Obviously you need to put real domain names in instead.
Please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain names.  This
is important; please note the lack of periods at the end of the domain
names.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="starting"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Starting named</A>
</H2>

<P>After all this it's time to start named.  If you're using a dialup
connection connect first.  Now run named, either by running the boot
script: <CODE>/etc/init.d/named start</CODE> or named directly:
<CODE>/usr/sbin/named</CODE>.  If you have tried previous versions of BIND
you're probably used to <CODE>ndc</CODE>.  I BIND 9 it has been replaced with
<CODE>rndc</CODE>, which can controll your named remotely, but it can't start
named anymore. If you view your syslog message file (usually called
<CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>, Debian calls it <CODE>/var/log/daemon</CODE>,
another directory to look is the other files <CODE>/var/log</CODE>) while
starting named (do <CODE>tail -f /var/log/messages</CODE>) you should see
something like:

<P>If there are any messages about errors then there is a mistake.
Named will name the file it is reading.  Go back and check the file.
Start named over when it is fixed.
<P>
<P>Now you can test your setup.  Traditionally a program called
<CODE>nslookup</CODE> is used for this.  These days <CODE>dig</CODE> is recommended:

<P>As you can plainly see this time it was much faster, 4ms versus
more than half a second earlier.  The answer was cached.  With cached
answers there is the possibility that the answer is out of date, but
the origin servers can control the time cached answers should be

<P>All OSes implementing the standard C API has the calls
gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.  These can get information from
several different sources.  Which sources it gets it from is
configured in <CODE>/etc/nsswitch.conf</CODE> on Linux (and some other
Unixes).  This is a long file specifying from which file or database
to get different kinds of data types.  It usually contains helpful
comments at the top, which you should consider reading.  After that
