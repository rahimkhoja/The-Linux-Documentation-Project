<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc2.1">What is GNU/Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>To fully appreciate LUGs' role in the GNU/Linux movement, it helps to
understand what makes GNU/Linux unique.</P>
<P>GNU/Linux as an operating system is powerful -- but GNU/Linux as an
<I><B>idea</B></I> about software development is even more so. GNU/Linux
is a <B>free</B> operating system: It's licensed under the GNU General
Public Licence. Thus, source code is freely available in perpetuity to
anyone.  It's maintained by a unstructured group of programmers
world-wide, under technical direction from Linus Torvalds and other key
developers. GNU/Linux as a movement has no central structure, bureaucracy,
or other entity to direct its affairs. While this situation has
advantages, it poses challenges for allocation of human resources,
effective advocacy, public relations, user education, and training.</P>

<P>(This HOWTO credits the Free Software Foundation's 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">GNU Project</A>
as the crucial motive force behind creating and furthering a free 
aka open source integrated system.  Thus, it refers to "distributions" 
comprising the GNU operating system atop the Linux kernel as "GNU/Linux".
Yes, the term is awkward, and FSF's request for credit isn't widely 
honoured; but the justice of FSF's claim is obvious.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc2.2">How is GNU/Linux unique?</A>
</H2>

<P>GNU/Linux's loose structure is unlikely to change.  That's a good thing:
It works precisely because people are free to come and go as they
please: <B>Free programmers are happy programmers are effective
programmers</B>.</P>
<P>However, this loose structure can disorient the new user: Whom
does she call for support, training, or education? How does she know
what GNU/Linux is suitable for?</P>
<P>In part, LUGs provide the answers, which is why LUGs are vital to
the movement: Because your town, village, or metropolis sports no
Linux Corporation "regional office", the LUG takes on many of the same
roles a regional office does for a large multi-national corporation.</P>
<P>GNU/Linux is unique in neither having nor being burdened by central
structures or bureaucracies to allocate its resources, train its users,
and support its products. These jobs get done through diverse means: the
Internet, consultants, VARs, support companies, colleges, and
universities. However, increasingly, in many places around the globe,
they are done by a LUG.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc2.3">What is a user group?</A>
</H2>

<P>Computer user groups are not new. In
fact, they were central to the personal computer's history:
Microcomputers arose in large part to satisfy demand for affordable,
personal access to computing resources from electronics, ham radio, and
other hobbyist user groups.  Giants like IBM eventually discovered the
PC to be a good and profitable thing, but initial impetus came from the
grassroots.</P>
<P>In the USA, user groups have changed -- many for the worse --
with the times. The financial woes and dissolution of the largest user
group ever, the Boston Computer Society, were well-reported; but, all
over the USA, most PC user groups have seen memberships decline.
American user groups in their heyday produced newsletters, maintained
shareware and diskette libraries, held meetings and social events, and,
sometimes, even ran electronic bulletin board systems (BBSes). With the
advent of the Internet, however, many services that user groups once
provided migrated to things like CompuServe and the Web.</P>
<P>GNU/Linux's rise, however, coincided with and was intensified by the
general public "discovering" the Internet. As the Internet grew more
popular, so did GNU/Linux: The Internet brought new users,
developers, and vendors. So, the same force that sent traditional user
groups into decline propelled GNU/Linux forward, and inspired new groups 
concerned exclusively with it. </P>
<P>To give just one indication of how LUGs differ from traditional 
user groups: Traditional groups must closely 
monitor what software users redistribute at meetings.
While illegal copying of restricted proprietary software certainly
occurred, it was officially discouraged -- for good reason.
At LUG meetings, however, that entire mindset simply does not apply:
Far from being forbidden, unrestricted copying of GNU/Linux
should be among a LUG's primary goals.  In fact, there is anecdotal
evidence of traditional user groups having difficulty adapting to
GNU/Linux's ability to be lawfully copied at will.</P>
<P>(Caveat:  A few distributions bundle GNU/Linux with proprietary
software packages whose terms don't permit public redistribution.
Check licence terms, if in doubt.  Offers or requests to copy 
distribution-restricted proprietary software of any sort should be
heavily discouraged anywhere in LUGs, and declared off-topic for all 
GNU/Linux user group on-line forums, for legal reasons.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc2.4">Summary</A>
</H2>

<P>For the GNU/Linux movement to grow, among other requirements,
LUGs must proliferate and succeed.  Because of GNU/Linux's
unusual nature, LUGs must provide some of the same functions a "regional
office" provides for large computer corporations like IBM, Microsoft,
and Sun. LUGs can and must train, support, and educate users,
coordinate consultants, advocate GNU/Linux as a computing solution,
and even serve as liaison to local news outlets.</P>
