<P>Edit your /etc/syslog.conf, and put in the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Script to view those compressed HOWTOs. <I>Didier Juges,</I> <CODE>dj@destin.nfds.net</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>From a newbie to another, here is a short script that eases looking for
and viewing howto documents.
My howto's are in /usr/doc/faq/howto/ and are gzipped. The file names are
XXX-HOWTO.gz, XXX being the subject.
I created the following script called "howto" in the /usr/local/sbin
directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
    ls /usr/doc/faq/howto | less
else
    gunzip -c /usr/doc/faq/howto/$1-HOWTO.gz | less
fi
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

When called without argument, it displays a directory of the available
howto's. Then when entered with the first part of the file name (before
the hyphen) as an argument, it unzips (keeping the original intact) then
displays the document.
<P>For instance, to view the Serial-HOWTO.gz document, enter:
<P>$ howto Serial

</H2>

<P>If you're like me, you have a list with 430 subscribers, plus 100+ messages per day coming in over UUCP.  
Well, what's a hacker to do with these huge logs?  
Install chklogs, that's what.
Chklogs is written by Emilio Grimaldo, <CODE>grimaldo@panama.iaehv.nl</CODE>, and the current version 1.8 
available from ftp.iaehv.nl:/pub/users/grimaldo/chklogs-1.8.tar.gz.
It's pretty self explanatory to install(you will, of course, check out the info in the doc subdirectory).  
Once you've got it installed, add a crontab entry like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Run chklogs at 9:00PM daily.
00 21 * * *       /usr/local/sbin/chklogs -m

<I>Ted Stern,</I> <CODE>stern@amath.washington.edu</CODE></H2>

<P>I don't know if many people have this problem, but there is a "feature" of GNU
make version 3.70 that I don't like. It is that VPATH acts funny if you give it
an absolute pathname.  There is an extremely solid patch that fixes this, which
you can get from Paul D. Smith <CODE>&lt;psmith@wellfleet.com></CODE>.  He also posts the
documentation and patch after every revision of GNU make on the newsgroup
&quot;gnu.utils.bug&quot; Generally, I apply this patch and recompile gmake on every
system I have access to.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.10">2.10 How do I stop my system from fscking on each reboot? <I>Dale Lutz,</I> <CODE>dal@wimsey.com</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Q:  How do I stop e2fsck from checking my disk every time I boot up.
<P>A:  When you rebuild the kernel, the filesystem is marked as 'dirty' and
so your disk will be checked with each boot.  The fix is to run:
<P>rdev -R /zImage 1
<P>This fixes the kernel so that it is no longer convinced that the 
filesystem is dirty.

<P>If you often get device busy errors on shutdown that leave the filesystem in
need of an fsck upon reboot, here is a simple fix:

mount -o remount,ro /mount.dir
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

for all your mounted filesystems except /, before the call to umount -a. This
means if, for some reason, shutdown fails to kill all processes and umount the
disks they will still be clean on reboot. Saves a lot of time at reboot for
me.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.18">2.18 Using ctags to ease programming.</A>
</H2>

<P>Most hackers already have ctags on their computers, but don't use it.  It can be 
very handy for editing specific functions.  Suppose you have a function, in one of
many source files in a directory for a program you're writing, and you want to
edit this function for updates.  We'll call this function foo().  You don't
where it is in the source file, either.  This is where ctags comes in handy.
When run, ctags produces a file named tags in the current dir, which is a listing of
all the functions, which files they're in and where they are in said files.  The
tags file looks like this:

<CODE>paul@geeky1.ebtech.net</CODE></H2>

<P>This is a fairly common problem, almost to the point of being a FAQ.  I don't
know if RedHat has fixed this bug in their distribution, but you can repair it
yourself.  If you look in your /etc/hosts file, you will find it looks something
like:

127.0.0.1               localhost       yourbox

<P>When sendmail starts, it does a lookup on your hostname(in this example, yourbox).
It then finds that the IP for yourbox is 127.0.0.1, sendmail doesn't like this,
so it does the lookup again.  It continues with this for a while until it
eventually gives up and exits.  Fixing the problem is extremely easy,
edit your /etc/hosts file and change it to something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
127.0.0.1               localhost
