This mapping is invariant across the SCSI sub system. [So these entries
could arguably be migrated to the mid level.]</P

a device is no longer responding (e.g. the device does not respond to
an SCSI INQUIRY command after it has been reset).</P

>The 'def_reserved_size' is both readable and writable. It is only writable
by root. It is initialized to the value of DEF_RESERVED_SIZE in the "sg.h"
file. Values between 0 and 1048576 (which is 2 ** 20) are accepted and can
be set from the command line with the following syntax:

></FONT

Note that the actual reserved buffer associated with a file descriptor could
be less than 'def_reserved_size' if appropriate memory is not available. If
the sg driver is compiled into the kernel (but not when it is a module)
this value can also be read at /proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff . This latter
feature is deprecated.</P

>The 'allow_dio' is both readable and writable. It is only writable by
root. When it is 0 (default) any request to do direct IO (i.e. by
setting SG_FLAG_DIRECT_IO) will be ignored and indirect IO will be done
instead.</P

>One strange quirk is that the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/scsi/sg</TT
> directory
will not appear if there are no SCSI devices (or pseudo devices such as
USB mass storage) attached to the system. The reason for this is that
in the absence of SCSI devices, the SCSI mid level does not initialize
the sg driver (even if it has been loaded as a module).
When the sg driver is a module and the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmmod sg</B
> is
successfully executed then the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/scsi/sg</TT
> directory
and its contents are removed.</P
