Those items output above that are significant to user applications
are described below.</P
><P
>Broadly speaking the above output shows everything is going fine.
Four SCSI READ(10) commands (SCSI opcode 0x28) for different ids
are underway. Three commands are active while one is finished with its
status and data read() and the request structure is pending deletion.
The "id" corresponds to the pack_id given in the sg_io_hdr structure
(or the sg_header structure). In the case if sgp_dd the pack_id
value is the block number being given to the SCSI READ (or WRITE).
You will notice the 4 ids are 128 apart.</P
><P
>The "&#62;&#62;&#62;" line shows the sg device name followed by the linux scsi
adapter, channel, scsi id and lun numbers. The "em=" argument indicates
whether the driver emulates a SCSI HBA. The ide-scsi driver would
set "em=1". The "sg_tablesize" is the maximum number of scatter gather
elements supported by the adapter driver. The "excl=0" indicates no
sg open() on this device is currently using the O_EXCL flag.</P
><P
>The next two lines starting with "FD(1)" supply data about the first
(and only in this case) open file descriptor on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sg0</TT
>. The default timeout is 60 seconds however this is only
significant if the sg_header interface is being used since the
sg_io_hdr interface explicits sets the timeout on a per command basis.
"bufflen=65536" is the reserved buffer size for this file descriptor.
The "(res)sgat=2" indicates that this reserved buffer requires 2
scatter gather elements. The "low_dma" will be set to 1 for ISA HBAs
indicating only the bottom 16 MB of RAM can be used for its kernel
buffers. The "cmd_q=1" indicates command queuing is being allowed.
The "f_packid=1" indicates the SG_SET_FORCE_PACK_ID mode is on.
The "k_orphan" value is 1 in the rare cases when a SG_IO is interrupted
while a SCSI command is "in flight". The "closed" value is 1 in the
rare cases the file descriptor has been closed while a SCSI command
is "in flight".</P
><P
>Each line indented with 5 spaces represents a SCSI command. The state
of the command is either:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>prior: command hasn't been sent to mid level (rare)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>act: mid level (adapter driver or device) has command</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>rcv: sg bottom half handler has received response to this
command (awaiting read() or SG_IO ioctl to complete</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>fin: SCSI response (and optionally data) has been or is
being read but the command data structures have not been removed</P
></LI
></UL
>
These states can be optionally prefixed by "rb&#62;&#62;" which means the reserved
buffer is being used, "dio&#62;&#62;" which means this command is using direct IO,
or "mmap&#62;&#62;" which means that mmap-ed IO is being used by this command.
The "id" is the pack_id from this command's interface structure. The "blen"
is the buffer length used by the data transfer associated with this command.
For commands that a response has been received "dur" shows its duration
in milliseconds. For commands still "in flight" an indication of
"t_o/elap=60000/10ms" means this command has a timeout of 60000 milliseconds
of which 10 milliseconds has already elapsed. The "sgat=2" argument
indicates that this command's "blen" requires 2 scatter gather elements.
The "op" value is the hexadecimal value of the SCSI command being executed.</P
><P
>If sg has lots of activity then the "debug" output may span many lines
and in some cases appear to be corrupted. This occurs because procfs requests
fixed buffer sizes of information and, if there is more data to output,
returns later to get the remainder. The problem with this strategy is that 
sg's internal state may have changed. Rather than double buffering, the sg
driver just continues from the same offset. While procfs is very useful, 
ioctl()s (such as SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE) still have their place.</P
