<P>There are a lot of different mice out there, and I cannot honestly say that
you should go out and buy one rather than the other. What I can do is give
a list of what I think these mice do, based on experience and heresay. 
Even with this information you should be a little cautious - we had two 
identical mice in our office on two computers, some things worked on one and
not t'other!
Any additions to this list would be welcome.
