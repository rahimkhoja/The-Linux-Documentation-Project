<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Why RTLinux</A></H2>

<P>The reasons for the design of RTLinux can be understood by examining the
working of the standard Linux kernel. The Linux kernel separates the hardware 
from the user-level tasks. The kernel uses scheduling algorithms and assigns 
priority to each task for providing good average performances or throughput. 
Thus the kernel has the ability to suspend any
user-level task, once that task has outrun the time-slice allotted to it
by the CPU. This scheduling algorithms along with device drivers, 
uninterruptible system calls, the use of interrupt disabling and virtual
memory operations are sources of unpredictability. That is to say,
these sources cause hindrance to the realtime performance of a task. 
<P>
<P>You might already be familiar with the non-realtime performance, say, 
when you are listening to the music played using 'mpg123' or any other player.
After executing this process for 
a pre-determined time-slice, the standard Linux kernel could preempt the 
task and give the CPU to another one 
(e.g. one that boots up the X server or Netscape). Consequently, 
the continuity of the music is lost. Thus, in trying to ensure fair distribution of
CPU time among all processes, the kernel can prevent other events from 
occurring. 
<P>
<P>A realtime kernel should be able to guarantee the timing requirements of
the processes under it.
The RTLinux kernel accomplishes realtime performances by removing such
sources of unpredictability as discussed above. We can consider the RTLinux
kernel as sitting between the standard Linux kernel and the hardware. The 
Linux kernel sees the realtime layer as the actual hardware. Now, the
user can both introduce and set priorities to each and every task. The user
can achieve correct timing for the processes by deciding on the 
scheduling algorithms, priorities, frequency of execution etc. The 
RTLinux kernel assigns lowest priority to the standard Linux kernel. Thus
the user-task will be executed in realtime.
<P>
<P>The actual realtime performance is obtained by intercepting all
hardware interrupts. Only for those interrupts that are related to
the RTLinux, the appropriate interrupt service routine is run. All other
interrupts are held and passed to the Linux kernel as software interrupts when
the RTLinux kernel is idle and then the standard Linux kernel runs. The RTLinux
executive is itself nonpreemptible.
<P>
<P>Realtime tasks are privileged (that is, they have direct access to hardware), and they
do not use virtual memory. Realtime tasks are written as special Linux
modules that can be dynamically loaded into memory. The 
initialization code for a realtime tasks initializes the realtime task 
structure and informs RTLinux kernel of its deadline,
period, and release-time constraints. 
<P>
<P>RTLinux co-exists along with the Linux kernel since it leaves the Linux
kernel untouched. Via a set of relatively simple modifications,
it manages to convert the existing Linux kernel into a hard realtime environment
without hindering future Linux development.
