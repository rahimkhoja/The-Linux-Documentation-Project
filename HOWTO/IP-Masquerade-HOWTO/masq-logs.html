>MASQ: Failed TCP Checksum error:</STRONG
>  You 
might see this error when a packet coming from the Internet gets corrupt in 
the data section of the packet but the rest of it "seems" ok.  When the Linux 
box receives this packet, it will calculate the CRC of the packet and 
determine that its corrupt.  On most machines running OSes like Microsoft 
Windows, they just silently drop the packets but Linux IP MASQ reports it.  If 
you get a LOT of them over your PPP link, first follow the FAQ entry above for 
"(Performance) - Masq seems is slow".  </P

>If the (Performance) FAQ tips don't help and you run PPP over dialup or PPPoE, 
you might try adding the line "-vj" (disabled VanJacobson header compression) to 
your /etc/ppp/options file and restart the PPPd connection.</P

>    With the use of various firewall rulesets, a given ruleset can either 
    DENY (silently drop) or REJECT traffic (sends back a ICMP error).  If 
    firewall logging is enabled, the errors will show up in the SYSLOG
    "messages" file found at:

        Redhat: 	/var/log
        Slackware:	/var/adm

    If you take a look at one of these firewall logs, you would see something 
    like:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    IPTABLES:
    ---------
    Feb 23 07:37:01 Roadrunner kernel: IPTABLES IN=eth0 OUT= 
      MAC=00:50:da:2e:e5:fb:00:03:47:73:c9:d2:08:00 SRC=12.75.147.174

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a LOT of information in just this one line of SYSLOG.  Lets break
out this example.  You should refer back to the original firewall hit as you 
read this.  

--------------

    1. ===================================================================

	- This packet firewall "hit" occurred on "Feb 23 07:37:01"

    2. ===================================================================

	- This packet was logged on the "RoadRunner" computer via the kernel

    3. ===================================================================

	- IPTABLES: the SYSLOG prepend string is "iptables" for information purposes

    - IPCHAINS: the packet was stopped on the INPUT chain

    - IPFWADM:  the packet was an IP packet

    4. ===================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet came IN on interface "eth0"

    - IPCHAINS: the packet was REJECTED (vs. dropped or accepted)

    - IPFWADM:  the packet was stopped on INPUT (vs. "fw-out" for OUT or 
       "fw-fwd" for FORWARD)

    5. ===================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet had NO output interface

    - IPCHAINS: the packet came in on the "eth0" interface

    - IPFWADM:  the packet was REJECTED "rej" (vs. "deny" or "accept")

    6. ===================================================================

    - IPTABLES: this display's the MAC address of the source and destination
                Ethetnet MAC address (only relivant for Ethernet networks)

    - IPCHAINS: the packet was IP protocol 6 or TCP
		        * If you don't know that protocol 6 is for TCP, look at 
                  your /etc/protocols file to see what other protocol numbers
                  are used for.

    - IPFWADM:  the packet on the "eth0" interface 

    7. ===================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's source IP address was 12.75.147.174

	- IPCHAINS: the packet's source IP address was 12.75.147.174

    - IPFWADM:  the packet was a "TCP" packet 

    8. ===================================================================

	- IPTABLES: the packet's destination IP address was 100.200.0.212

    - IPCHAINS: the packet's source PORT was 1633 

    - IPFWADM:  the packet's source IP address was 12.75.147.174

    - IPTABLES: the packet's length was 44 bytes

	- IPCHAINS: the packet's destination IP address was 100.200.0.212

    - IPFWADM:  the packet's source PORT was 1633

    10. ===================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's TOS markings (type of service which basically
                means class of service) was 0x00 or zero.

    - IPCHAINS: the packet's destination PORT was 23 (telnet)
		        * If you don't know that port 23 is for TELNETing, look at 
                  your /etc/services file to see what other ports are used 
                  for.

    - IPFWADM:  the packet's destination IP address was 100.200.0.212 

    11. ===================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's precedense markings (class of service) was 
                0x00 or zero.

    - IPCHAINS: the packet's length was 44 bytes

    - IPFWADM:  the packet's destination PORT was 23 (telnet)
		        * If you don't know that port 23 is for TELNETing, look at 
                  your /etc/services file to see what other ports are used 
                  for.

    12. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's TTL or Time to Live was 64 or 64 router hops
		        * Every router hop over the Internet will subtract (1) from 
                  this number.  Usually, packets will start with a number of 
                  255 (depends on the operating system) and if that number 
                  ever reaches (0), it means that realistically, the packet 
                  was lost in a network loop and should be deleted. 

    - IPCHAINS: the packet's TOS markings (type of service which basically
                means class of service) was 0x00 or zero.
		        * divide this by 4 to get the Type of Service (presidence) 

    - IPFWADM:  the packet was 44 bytes long

    13. ==================================================================

	- IPTABLES: the packet had various TCP flags set such as SYN, SYN+ACK,
                etc. (shown in HEX)

    - IPCHAINS: the packet had various TCP flags set (shown in hex)

    - IPFWADM:  the packet's TOS markings (type of service which basically
                means class of service) was 0x00 or zero.

    14. ==================================================================

	- IPTABLES: the packet's "don't fragment" or DF bit was set from the 
                source computer

    - IPCHAINS: the packet had a fragmentation offset of 40 (shown in HEX)

		        --Don't worry if you don't understand this.. 
		        * A value that started with "0x2..." or "0x3..." means the 
                  "More Fragments" bit was set so more fragmented packets 
                  will be coming in to complete this one BIG packet.
		        * A value which started with "0x4..." or "0x5..." means that 
                  the "Don't Fragment" bit was set  
		        * Any other values are the Fragment offset (divided by 8) to 
                  be later used to recombine into the original LARGE packet

	- IPFWADM:  the packet had various TCP flags set such as SYN, SYN+ACK,
                etc. (shown in HEX)

    15. ==================================================================

	- IPTABLES: the packet was a TCP packet

    - IPCHAINS: the packet's TTL or Time to Live was 64 or 64 router hops

                  ever reaches (0), it means that realistically, the packet 
                  was lost in a network loop and should be deleted.

                  be later used to recombine into the original LARGE packet

    16. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's soure PORT was 4313

    - IPCHAINS: 

    - IPFWADM:  the packet's TTL or Time to Live was 64 or 64 router hops
		        * Every router hop over the Internet will subtract (1) from 
                  this number.  Usually, packets will start with a number of

                  was lost in a network loop and should be deleted. 

    17. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's destination PORT was 23 (telnet)
		        * If you don't know that port 23 is for TELNETing, look at 
                  your /etc/services file to see what other ports are used 
                  for.

    - IPCHAINS:

    - IPFWADM: 

    18. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's TCP window (sliding or selective TCP ack)
                was 32120 bytes

    - IPCHAINS:

    - IPFWADM:

    19. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's TCP reserved bits were 0x00 (HEX) - unused

    - IPCHAINS:

    - IPFWADM:

    20. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's TCP header SYN bit was set
                * IPTABLES displays all the TCP header bits by name and not
                  by a HEX dump

    - IPCHAINS:

    - IPFWADM:

    21. ==================================================================

    - IPTABLES: the packet's TCP header URGENT bit was set - rarely used
