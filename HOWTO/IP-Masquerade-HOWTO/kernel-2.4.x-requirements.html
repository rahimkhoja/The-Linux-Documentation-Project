>The newest 2.4.x kernels are now using both a completely new TCP/IP network
stack as well as a new NAT sub-system called NetFilter.  Within this NetFilter
suite of tools, we now have a tool called IPTABLES for the 2.4.x kernels much 
like there was IPCHAINS for the 2.2.x kernels and IPFWADM for the 2.0.x kernels.
The new IPTABLES system is far more powerful (combines several functions into 
one place like true NAT functionality), offers better security (stateful 
inspection), and better performance with the new 2.4.x TCP/IP stack.  But this 
new suite of tools can be a bit complicated in comparison to older generation 
kernels.  Hopefully, if you follow along with this HOWTO carefully, setting up
IPMASQ won't be too bad.  If you find anything unclear, downright wrong, etc. 
please email David about it.</P
><P
><STRONG
>Unlike</STRONG
> the migration to IPCHAINS from 
IPFWADM, the new NetFilter tool has kernel modules that can actually 
support older IPCHAINS and IPFWADM rulesets with minimal changes.  So 
re-writing your old MASQ or firewall ruleset scripts is not longer required.  
<STRONG
>BUT..</STRONG
> with the 2.4.x kernels, you cannot
use the old 2.2.x MASQ modules like ip_masq_ftp, ip_masq_irc, etc. 
<STRONG
>AND</STRONG
> IPCHAINS is incompatible with the 
new IPTABLES modules like ip_conntrack_ftp, etc.  So, what does this mean?
It basically means that if you want to use IPMASQ or PORTFW functionality under 
a 2.4.x kernel, you shouldn't use IPCHAINS rules but IPTABLES ones instead.  
Please also keep in mind that there might be several benefits in performing a 
full ruleset re-write to take advantage of the newer IPTABLES features like 
stateful tracking, etc. but that is dependant upon how much time you have to 
migrate your old rulesets.  Please see <A

MASQ kernel modules written to make non-NAT friendly network applications
work through IPMASQ need to be re-written for the 2.4.x kernels.  Because of 
this, if you specifically need functionality from some of these modules
(see below), you should stay with a 2.2.x kernel until these modules have 
been either ported or the application has been updated to use NAT-friendly
protocols.  If you are curious on the porting status of a given module, 
please email the author of the module and NOT David or Ambrose.  We don't 
code.. we just document.  :-)</P
