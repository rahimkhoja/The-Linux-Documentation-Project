>6.10. Gamers:  The LooseUDP patch</H1
><P
>The LooseUDP patch allows semi-NAT-friendly games that usually use UDP 
connections to both WORK behind a Linux IP Masquerade server.  </P
><P
>What the LooseUDP patch does is allow ALL UDP packets to be NATed 
through the MASQ box without any checks or expiration.  This liberal 
forwarding method is considered insecure by many and is disabled in modern
2.2.x kernels.  The 2.4.x kernels with it's IPTABLES stateful UDP inspection 
only allows incoming UDP packets into the machine (and thus MASQ) if there was 
already an outbound UDP packet to that same host in it's stateful table.  If
the MASQ host hasn't sent a UDP packet to the remote host within ~30 seconds,
the return UDP table entry is deleted.  Because of this, IPTABLES removes most 
of the need for the LooseUDP patch as it does it in a more secure fashion.</P
><P
>Currently, LooseUDP is available as a patch for 2.0.36+ kernels and it is 
already built into 2.2.3+ kernels though it is now DISABLED by DEFAULT in 
2.2.16+ (please see the example rc.firewal ruleset comments for details).  </P

   Basically, the old 2.0.x / 2.2.x LooseUDP code was considered a security 
   issue.  Because of this, it was removed from the kernel.  Fortunately, some 
   games that used to require the LooseUDP code on the 2.2.x IPCHAINS system 
   might work just final under the 2.4.x IPTABLES kernels.  If the games don't 
   work, I'm not aware of a solution for you.   Sorry.

>Once you are running the new LooseUDP enabled kernel, you should be good to go 
for most NAT-friendly games.  Some URLs have been given for patches to make 
games like BattleZone and others NAT friendly.  Please see
