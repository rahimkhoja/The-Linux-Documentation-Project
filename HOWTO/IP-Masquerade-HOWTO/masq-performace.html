><P
>There might be a few reasons for this:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>You might be unrealistic about how much available bandwidth is on your modem 
line.  Lets do the math for a typical 56k modem connection:</P
><P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>56k modems = 56,000 bits per second.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>You really DON'T have a 56k modem but a 52k modem per US FCC limitations.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>You'll almost NEVER get 52k, the best connection I used to get was  48k</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>48,000 bits per second is 4,800 BYTES per second (8 bits to a byte +
2 bits for the START and STOP RS-232 serial bits)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>With an MTU of 1500, you will get (3.2) packets in one second.  Since
this will involve fragmentation, you need to round DOWN to (3) packets per
second.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Again with MTU of 1500, thats 3.2 x 40 bytes of TCP/IP overhead (8%)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>So the BEST throughput you could hope for is 4.68KB/s w/o compression.
Compression, be it v.42bis hardware compression, MNP5, or MS/Stac compression 
can yeild impressive numbers on highly compressable stuff like TEXT files, but 
acutally slow things down when transfering pre-compressed files like ZIPs, 
MP3s, etc.</P

<P

><LI
><P
>Make sure you don't have both your INTERNAL and EXTERNAL networks running on 
the same network card with the "IP Alias" feature.  If you 
<STRONG
>ARE</STRONG
> doing this, it can be made to work 
but it will be excessively slow due to high levels of collisions, IRQ usage, 
etc.  It is highly recommended that you install another network card for the 
internal and external networks to have their own interface.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make sure you have the right Ethernet settings for both SPEED and DUPLEX.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Some 10Mb/s Ethernet cards and most 100Mb/s cards support FULL Duplex 
connections.  Direct connections from an Ethernet card to, say, a DSL modem 
(without any hubs in between) *CAN* be set to FULL DUPLEX but only if the 
DSL modem supports it.  You should also be sure that you have Ethernet cables 
with all eight wires used and that they are in good condition.</P
><P
>Internal networks that use HUBs -cannot- use Full Duplex.  You need either a 
10 or 100Mb.s Ethernet <STRONG
>SWITCH</STRONG
> to be able 
to do this.</P
><P
>Both auto 10/100Mb/s SPEED negotiation and Full/Half DUPLEX negotiation on 
Ethernet cards can wreck havoc on networks.  I recommend to hard code both the 
NIC speed and duplex into the NIC(s) if possible.  This is directly possible 
via Linux NIC kernel modules but isn't directly possible in monolithic kernels.  
You will need to either use MII utililies from 
<A

>Section 8.1</A
> or hardcode the 
kernel source.</P

>If you have an external modem, make sure you have a good serial cable.  Also, 
many PCs have cheesy ribbon cables connecting the serial port from the 
motherboard or I/O card to the serial port connection.  If you have one of 
these, make sure it is in good condition.  Personally, I have ferrite coils 
(those grey-black metal like rings) around ALL of my ribbon cables.</P

significantly increase serial port performance including SLIP and PPP 
connections.</P

(or faster if both your modem and serial port can handle it.. a.k.a  ISDN 
terminal adapters)

>2.0.x kernels:  The 2.0.x kernels are kind of an odd ball because you can't 
directly tell the kernel to clock the serial ports at 115200.  So, in one of 
your startup scripts like the /etc/rc.d/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.serial file, 
execute the following commands for a modem on COM2:  </P
