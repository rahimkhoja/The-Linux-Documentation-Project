<P>
<P>Not only is ``Dialup Networking'' available under Linux, it's also more
stable and quicker. The name of the game is ``PPP'', the protocol employed
for connecting to the Internet using modems. All you need is a tool that
dials out and makes the connection.
<P>To retrieve your mail from the ISP's server you need a tool called ``email
fetcher'' that uses the POP protocol; when the mail is fetched it will
appear as though it had been directly delivered to your Linux box. You'll
then use a MUA (Mail User Agent) like <CODE>pine</CODE>, <CODE>mutt</CODE>,
<CODE>elm</CODE> or many others to manage it.
<P>While under Windows the dialer is automatically invoked when you launch an
Internet application, under Linux the path is the other way round: you dial
first, then launch the application. A thing called <CODE>diald</CODE> provides
the usual behaviour. Installing and configuring dialup networking used to be
one of the most difficult things to do under Linux, but not anymore: please
consult the Configuration HOWTO.
<P>Finally, a word about ``Network neighborhood'': you can make your Linux
workstation appear as Windows NT/9x in a local network of Windows machines!
The magic word is Samba: not the lively Brazilian dance, but an
implementation of the SMB protocol for Linux. Go to
