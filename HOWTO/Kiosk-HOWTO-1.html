<P>Information display kiosks are useful in libraries, galleries and
museums, educational institutions, municipal offices, visitor
information booths, conferences, shopping malls, airports---in short
any location where simple, easy access to information is
desirable. Kiosks are normally set up with touchscreens or pointing
devices such as trackballs, to allow people to select and view
information that is attractively displayed and up to date.
<P>There are many ways to create kiosks, from expensive solutions based
on proprietary software to HTML-based open-source
solutions. Browser-based technologies are particularly attractive
because they are inherently multimedia, offering text, graphics, sound
and streaming media, and the content is highly portable.
<P>Linux provides a flexible and interesting platform for kiosk
development. Linux is inexpensive to set up and it offers a wide range
of options, from diskless display stations to self-contained,
database-driven web servers. Due to the versatility of the underlying
operating system, a well-designed Linux kiosk can be placed in a
remote location and administered via a telephone or network link.
<P>This HOWTO explores one method of setting up Linux as a standalone
information kiosk, using Netscape Navigator 4.X and FVWM2 on a Red Hat
Linux 6.X system. It is based on a kiosk I set up for use in the
<I>Hands-on Biodiversity Gallery</I> in the Royal Ontario Museum
(
<A HREF="http://www.rom.on.ca">http://www.rom.on.ca</A>), Toronto, Canada. The kiosk
outlined in this HOWTO incorporates a trackball rather than a more
expensive touchscreen. There are undoubtedly many other ways to create
a Linux-based kiosk, but this one has worked reliably for us and it
may provide a useful starting point for your own kiosk project.

<P>Our Linux kiosk derives heavily from the work done by the City of
Charlotte, North Carolina, for their municipal website,
<I>Charlotte's Web</I> (see 
<A HREF="http://www.charweb.org/webinfo/kiosk/">http://www.charweb.org/webinfo/kiosk/</A>). The Charlotte's Web
kiosk project, which employs a touchscreen monitor, was set up in 1996
using an early version of Slackware Linux, Netscape Navigator 2.X, and
FVWM. The webmasters at Charlotte have created a very useable kiosk
implementation and have shared their complete setup via their
website. This HOWTO, to a certain degree, represents an update of
their work, altering the details to work with Red Hat 6.X, Netscape
Navigator 4.X, FVWM2, and a custom-made trackball.
<P>I worked with Debra Luneau (debral@rom.on.ca), the Royal Ontario
Museum webmaster, to create the graphics overlays for Netscape. The
examples we distribute at our ftp site are her work---and are the ones
we use on the kiosk in the Biodiversity Gallery.
<P>The Ontario Biodiversity section of the ROM website was designed by
Hopscotch Interactive (www.hopscotch.ca). The original application was
converted from a flat-file database system to a MySQL-database driven
system by Gord Howells (gordonh@rom.on.ca), the ROM's database
designer and programmer. The non-kiosk version of this mini-site may
be viewed at
