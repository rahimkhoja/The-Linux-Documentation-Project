<H2><A NAME="compile"></A> <A NAME="s2">2. Compilation and installation</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Prerequisites and kernel setup</A>
</H2>

<P>Before starting, you should think about whether you really need to
compile the PCMCIA package yourself.  All common Linux distributions
come with pre-compiled driver packages.  Generally, you only need to
install the drivers from scratch if you need a new feature of the
current drivers, or if you've updated and/or reconfigured your kernel
in a way that is incompatible with the drivers included with your
Linux distribution.  While compiling the package is not technically
difficult, it does require some general Linux familiarity.
<P>The following things should be installed on your system before you
begin:
<UL>
<LI>A 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, or 2.6 series kernel source tree.</LI>
<LI>An appropriate set of module utilities.</LI>
<LI>(Optional) the ``XForms'' X11 user interface toolkit.</LI>
</UL>
<P>You need to have a complete linux source tree for your kernel, not
just an up-to-date kernel image.  The driver modules contain some
references to kernel source files.  While you may want to build a new
kernel to remove unnecessary drivers, installing PCMCIA does not
require you to do so.
<P>Current ``stable'' kernel sources and patches are available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4">ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4</A>.  Current
module utilities can be found in the same locations.  
<P>In the Linux kernel source tree, the <CODE>Documentation/Changes</CODE>
file describes the versions of all sorts of other system components
that are required for that kernel release.  You may want to check
through this and verify that your system is up to date, especially if
you have updated your kernel.  If you are using a development kernel,
be sure that you are using the right combination of shared libraries
and module tools.
<P>On x86 based systems, if you plan to use 16-bit PC Card devices, you
should also enable <CODE>CONFIG_ISA</CODE>, for recent kernels.  These cards
behave much like ISA devices, and the PCMCIA drivers use
<CODE>CONFIG_ISA</CODE> to judge whether a platform supports ISA bus
interrupts.
<P>When configuring your kernel, if you plan on using a PCMCIA ethernet
card, you should turn on networking support but turn off the normal
Linux network card drivers, including the ``pocket and portable
adapters''.  The PCMCIA network card drivers are all implemented as
loadable modules.  Any drivers compiled into your kernel will only
waste space.
<P>If you want to use SLIP, PPP, or PLIP, you do need to either configure
your kernel with these enabled, or use the loadable module versions of
these drivers.
<P>In order to use a PCMCIA token ring adapter, your kernel should be
configured with ``Token Ring driver support'' (<CODE>CONFIG_TR</CODE>)
enabled, though you should leave <CODE>CONFIG_IBMTR</CODE> off.
<P>If you want to use a PCMCIA IDE adapter, your kernel should be
configured with <CODE>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_PCMCIA</CODE> enabled, for 2.0.*
kernels.  Newer kernels do not require a special configuration
setting.
<P>If you will be using a PCMCIA SCSI adapter, then enable
<CODE>CONFIG_SCSI</CODE> when configuring your kernel.  Also, enable any top
level drivers (SCSI disk, tape, cdrom, generic) that you expect to
use.  All low-level drivers for particular host adapters should be
disabled, as they will just take up space.
<P>This package includes an X-based card status utility called
<CODE>cardinfo</CODE>.  This utility is based on a freely distributed user
interface toolkit called the XForms Library.  This library is
available as a separate package with most Linux distributions.  If you
would like to build <CODE>cardinfo</CODE>, you should install XForms and all
the normal X header files and libraries before configuring the PCMCIA
package.  This tool is completely optional.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Kernel PCMCIA support</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>PCMCIA driver support is included in the 2.4 and later linux kernel
trees.  While it shares most of the same code with the standalone
PCMCIA driver package, there are some important differences.  The
kernel PCMCIA support is also still evolving.
<P>The kernel PCMCIA code has the same functionality as the driver side
of the pcmcia-cs package.  It does not eliminate the need to install
the pcmcia-cs package, since it requires the same user tools
(<CODE>cardmgr</CODE>, <CODE>cardctl</CODE>, <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/*</CODE> files).  The
drivers in pcmcia-cs can still be built for 2.4 kernels, so you 
have a choice of using either the in-kernel PCMCIA drivers, or the
drivers included in pcmcia-cs.  With 2.5 and later kernels, the
standalone drivers cannot be used.
<P>To use the kernel PCMCIA drivers, configure the kernel with
<CODE>CONFIG_HOTPLUG</CODE>, <CODE>CONFIG_PCMCIA</CODE>, and usually
<CODE>CONFIG_CARDBUS</CODE> enabled.  On x86 based systems, <CODE>CONFIG_ISA</CODE>
should also be enabled.  The drivers can either be built into the
kernel or built as modules.  PCMCIA client driver options are listed
in their regular driver categories; thus, PCMCIA network drivers are
in a submenu of network drivers, and PCMCIA serial drivers are in a
submenu of character drivers.
<P>In the standalone pcmcia-cs drivers, the <CODE>i82365</CODE> module supports
both ISA-to-PCMCIA, PCI-to-PCMCIA, and PCI-to-CardBus bridges.  The
CardBus socket driver in the 2.4 tree is the <CODE>yenta_socket</CODE> driver.
It is selected by the <CODE>CONFIG_CARDBUS</CODE> option.  In your PCMCIA
startup options, this driver should be specified in place of the
<CODE>i82365</CODE> driver.  The kernel version of the <CODE>i82365</CODE> driver,
selected by <CODE>CONFIG_I82365</CODE>, only supports ISA-to-PCMCIA bridges.
PCI-to-PCMCIA bridges that are not CardBus capable, like the Cirrus
PD6729, are not supported at all by the kernel PCMCIA drivers.
<P>When compiling the standalone PCMCIA package, the Configure script
decides whether or not to build any kernel modules by looking at the
value of the <CODE>CONFIG_PCMCIA</CODE> option in your kernel configuration.
If <CODE>CONFIG_PCMCIA</CODE> is enabled, then by default, no driver
components are built.  If <CODE>CONFIG_PCMCIA</CODE> is disabled, then all the
modules will be built and installed.  It is safe to compile the user
tools (cardmgr, cardctl, etc) in a PCMCIA package whose version number
differs from the PCMCIA version number in the kernel source tree.  The
kernel PCMCIA header files take precedence over the ones included in
the PCMCIA package, if <CODE>CONFIG_PCMCIA</CODE> is enabled.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>Here is a synopsis of the installation process:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack pcmcia-cs-3.2.?.tar.gz in /usr/src.</LI>
<LI>Run ``<CODE>make config</CODE>'' in the new <CODE>pcmcia-cs-3.2.?</CODE> directory.</LI>
<LI>Run ``<CODE>make all</CODE>'', then ``<CODE>make install</CODE>''.</LI>
<LI>Customize the startup script and the option files in
<CODE>/etc/pcmcia</CODE> for your site, if needed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you plan to install any contributed client drivers not included in
the core PCMCIA distribution, unpack each of them in the top-level
directory of the PCMCIA source tree.  Then follow the normal build
instructions.  The extra drivers will be compiled and installed
automatically.  
<P>Running ``<CODE>make config</CODE>'' prompts for a few configuration options,
and checks out your system to verify that it satisfies all
prerequisites for installing PCMCIA support.  In most cases, you'll be
able to just accept all the default configuration options.  Be sure to
carefully check the output of this command in case there are problems.
The following options are available:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Linux kernel source directory?</B><DD><P>This is the location of the source tree for the kernel you want to use
with PCMCIA.  Often this is <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE>, but the default
location depends on what Linux distribution you're using (or on where
you've chosen to place your kernel source tree).
<P>
<DT><B>Build 'trusting' versions of card utilities?</B><DD><P>Some of the support utilities (<CODE>cardctl</CODE> and <CODE>cardinfo</CODE>) can be
compiled either in ``safe'' or ``trusting'' forms.  The ``safe'' forms
prevent non-root users from modifying card configurations.  The
``trusting'' forms permit ordinary users to issue commands to suspend
and resume cards, reset cards, and change the current configuration
scheme.  The default is to build the safe forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Include 32-bit (CardBus) card support?</B><DD><P>This option must be selected if you wish to use 32-bit CardBus cards.
It is not required for CardBus bridge support, if you only plan to use
16-bit PC Cards.
<P>
<DT><B>Include PnP BIOS resource checking?</B><DD><P>This builds additional code into the PCMCIA core module to communicate
with a system's PnP BIOS to obtain resource information for built-in
``motherboard'' devices (serial and parallel ports, sound, etc), to
help avoid resource conflicts.  If enabled, some extra resource files
will be created under <CODE>/proc/bus/pccard</CODE>, and the <CODE>lspnp</CODE>
and <CODE>setpnp</CODE> tools can be used to view and manipulate PnP BIOS
devices.  However, this setting causes problems on some laptops and is
not turned on by default.
<P>
<DT><B>Module install directory?</B><DD><P>The directory that new kernel modules will be installed into.
Normally this should be the subdirectory of <CODE>/lib/modules</CODE> that
matches your kernel version.
<P>
<DT><B>How to set kernel-specific options?</B><DD><P>There are a few kernel configuration options that affect the PCMCIA
tools.  The configuration script can deduce these from the running
kernel (the default and most common case).  Alternatively, if you are
compiling for installation on another machine, it can read the
configuration from a kernel source tree, or each option can be set
interactively.
<P>
</DL>
<P>The <CODE>Configure</CODE> script can also be executed non-interactively, for
automatic builds or to quickly reconfigure after a kernel update.
Some additional less-frequently-used options can be only be set from
the command line.  Running ``<CODE>Configure --help</CODE>'' lists all
available options.
<P>Running ``<CODE>make all</CODE>'' followed by ``<CODE>make install</CODE>'' will build
and then install the kernel modules and utility programs.  Kernel
modules are installed under <CODE>/lib/modules/&lt;version&gt;/pcmcia</CODE>.
The <CODE>cardmgr</CODE> and <CODE>cardctl</CODE> programs are installed in
<CODE>/sbin</CODE>.  If <CODE>cardinfo</CODE> is built, it is installed in
<CODE>/usr/bin/X11</CODE>.  
<P>Configuration files will be installed in the <CODE>/etc/pcmcia</CODE>
directory.  If you are installing over an older version, your old
config scripts will be backed up before being replaced.  The saved
scripts will be given an <CODE>*.O</CODE> extension.
<P>If you don't know what kind of host controller your system uses, you
can use the <CODE>pcic_probe</CODE> utility in the <CODE>cardmgr/</CODE>
subdirectory to determine this.  There are several major types: the
Databook TCIC-2 type and the Intel i82365SL-compatible type.  With the
kernel PCMCIA subsystem, Intel compatible controllers are further
subdivided into ISA-bus 16-bit bridges, and PCI-based CardBus bridges.
<P>In a few cases, the <CODE>pcic_probe</CODE> command will be unable to determine
your controller type automatically.  If you have a Halikan NBD 486
system, it has a TCIC-2 controller at an unusual location: you'll need
to edit <CODE>rc.pcmcia</CODE> to load the <CODE>tcic</CODE> module, and also set the
<CODE>PCIC_OPTS</CODE> parameter to ``<CODE>tcic_base=0x02c0</CODE>''.
<P>On some old pre-PCI systems using Cirrus controllers, including the
NEC Versa M, the BIOS puts the controller in a special suspended state
at system startup time.  On these systems, the <CODE>pcic_probe</CODE> command will
fail to find any known host controller.  If this happens, edit
<CODE>rc.pcmcia</CODE> and set <CODE>PCIC</CODE> to <CODE>i82365</CODE>, and <CODE>PCIC_OPTS</CODE> to
``<CODE>wakeup=1</CODE>''.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="startup"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Startup options</A>
</H2>

<P>The PCMCIA startup script recognizes several groups of startup
options, set via environment variables.  Multiple options should be
separated by spaces and enclosed in quotes.  Placement of startup
options depends on the Linux distribution used.  They may be placed
directly in the startup script, or they may be kept in a separate
option file.  See the 
<A HREF="#distributions">Notes about specific Linux distributions</A> for specifics.  The following variables
can be set: 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PCMCIA</CODE></B><DD><P>This variable specifies whether PCMCIA support should be started up,
or not.  If it is set to anything other than ``yes'', then the startup
script will be disabled.
<DT><B><CODE>PCIC</CODE></B><DD><P>This identifies the PC Card Interface Controller driver module.  There
are several options: ``tcic'', ``i82365'', and (for the kernel PCMCIA
subsystem) ``yenta_socket''.  Virtually all current controllers are in
the ``i82365'' group for the standalone drivers, and ``yenta_socket''
for the kernel drivers.  This is the only mandatory option setting.
<DT><B><CODE>PCIC_OPTS</CODE></B><DD><P>This specifies options for the PCIC module.  Some host controllers
have optional features that may or may not be implemented in a
particular system.  In some cases, it is impossible for the socket
driver to detect if these features are implemented.  See the
corresponding man page for a complete description of the available
options. 
<DT><B><CODE>CORE_OPTS</CODE></B><DD><P>This specifies options for the <CODE>pcmcia_core</CODE> module, which
implements the core PC Card driver services.  See ``<CODE>man
pcmcia_core</CODE>'' for more information.
<DT><B><CODE>CARDMGR_OPTS</CODE></B><DD><P>This specifies options to be passed to the <CODE>cardmgr</CODE> daemon.  See
``<CODE>man cardmgr</CODE>'' for more information.
<DT><B><CODE>SCHEME</CODE></B><DD><P>If set, then the PC Card configuration scheme will be initialized to
this at driver startup time.  See the 
<A HREF="PCMCIA-HOWTO-4.html#config">Overview of the PCMCIA configuration scripts</A> for a discussion of schemes.
</DL>
<P>The low level socket drivers, <CODE>tcic</CODE> and <CODE>i82365</CODE>, have various
bus timing parameters that may need to be adjusted for certain systems
with unusual bus clocking.  Symptoms of timing problems can include
card recognition problems, lock-ups under heavy loads, high error
rates, or poor device performance.  Only certain host bridges have
adjustable timing parameters: check the corresponding man page to see
what options are available for your controller.  Here is a brief
summary:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>ISA-bus Cirrus controllers have numerous configurable timing
parameters.  The most important seems to be the <CODE>cmd_time</CODE> flag,
which determines the length of PCMCIA bus cycles.  Fast 486 systems
(i.e., DX4-100) seem to often benefit from increasing this from 6 (the
default) to 12 or 16.</LI>
<LI>The Cirrus PD6729 PCI controller has the <CODE>fast_pci</CODE> flag, which
should be set if the PCI bus speed is greater than 25 MHz.</LI>
<LI>For Vadem VG-468 controllers, the <CODE>async_clock</CODE> flag changes the
relative clocking of PCMCIA bus and host bus cycles.  Setting this
flag adds extra wait states to some operations.  However, I have yet
to hear of a laptop that needs this.</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>pcmcia_core</CODE> module has the <CODE>cis_speed</CODE> parameter for
changing the memory speed used for accessing a card's Card Information
Structure (CIS).  On some systems, increasing this parameter (i.e.,
slowing down card accesses) may fix card recognition problems.</LI>
<LI>Another <CODE>pcmcia_core</CODE> parameter, <CODE>io_speed</CODE>, can be used to slow
down accesses to IO cards.  It may help in certain cases with systems
that have out-of-spec PCMCIA bus timing.</LI>
<LI>This is not a timing issue, but if you have more than one ISA-to-PCMCIA
controller in your system or extra sockets in a laptop docking station,
the <CODE>i82365</CODE> module should be loaded with the <CODE>extra_sockets</CODE>
parameter set to 1.  This should not be necessary for detection of
PCI-to-PCMCIA or PCI-to-CardBus bridges.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Here are some timing settings for a few old systems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>On the ARM Pentium-90 or Midwest Micro Soundbook Plus, use
``<CODE>freq_bypass=1 cmd_time=8</CODE>''.</LI>
<LI>On a Compaq Presario 1220, try ``<CODE>setup_time=1</CODE>''.</LI>
<LI>On a Midwest Micro Soundbook Elite, use ``<CODE>cmd_time=12</CODE>''.</LI>
<LI>On a Gateway Liberty, try ``<CODE>cmd_time=16</CODE>''.</LI>
<LI>On a Samsung SENS 810, use ``<CODE>fast_pci=1</CODE>''.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Card readers for desktop systems</H3>

<P>While almost all PCMCIA card readers and card docks work fine under
Linux, some require special startup options because they do not behave
exactly like laptop PCMCIA bridges.  PCI card readers, in particular,
may handle interrupts differently.  Some of the following parameter
settings are only available for the <CODE>i82365</CODE> module in the
standalone drivers; the kernel's <CODE>yenta_socket</CODE> driver is not
configurable.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Linksys ProConnect PCMRDWR and Antec DataChute ISA card readers
are ``ISA Plug and Play'' devices.  To use these, you must first
activate them with the Linux isapnp tools.  See the man pages for
<CODE>pnpdump</CODE> and <CODE>isapnp</CODE> for more information.</LI>
<LI>For Chase CardPORT and Altec ISA card readers using the Cirrus PD6722
ISA-to-PCMCIA bridge, the <CODE>i82365</CODE> driver should be loaded with a
``<CODE>has_ring=0</CODE>'' parameter to prevent irq 15 conflicts.</LI>
<LI>For Elan P-series PCI card readers based on the Cirrus PD6729
PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge chip, the <CODE>i82365</CODE> driver requires a
``<CODE>irq_mode=1</CODE>'' parameter.</LI>
<LI>For the Sycard PCChost1200 host adapter, the <CODE>i82365</CODE> driver
requires a ``<CODE>p2cclk=1</CODE>'' parameter.</LI>
<LI>For the Alex Electronics PCICBI host adapter based on the TI 1221
bridge, the <CODE>i82365</CODE> driver requires ``<CODE>p2cclk=1 irq_mode=0</CODE>''
as well as PCMCIA driver release 3.1.23 or later.</LI>
<LI>With SCM Microsystems SBP series PCI card readers (which are also
being distributed with Lucent WaveLAN IEEE cards), and for the
Synchrotech PCM-CR-PC2IF and PCM-CR-PC2IR, it is necessary to
specify ``<CODE>irq_mode=0</CODE>'' for the <CODE>i82365</CODE> module, to force use
of PCI interrupts.</LI>
<LI>For the ActionTec PC 750 card reader, and for the Antec Datachute PCI
card reader, the <CODE>i82365</CODE> driver requires a ``<CODE>irq_list=0</CODE>''
parameter, to indicate that ISA interrupts are unavailable.</LI>
<LI>The PLX Technologies PCI9052 (also sold as the Linksys WDT11) is not a
general purpose PCMCIA card reader at all: it is a PCI interface card
for use with certain wireless adapters, that makes them look like
ordinary PCI devices.  These devices are not supported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 System resource settings</A>
</H2>

<P>Card Services should automatically avoid allocating IO ports and
interrupts already in use by other standard devices.  It will also
attempt to detect conflicts with unknown devices, but this is not
completely reliable.  In some cases, you may need to explicitly
exclude resources for a device in <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</CODE>.
<P>Here are some resource settings for specific laptop types.  View this
list with suspicion: it may give useful hints for solving problems,
but it is inevitably out of date and certainly contains mistakes.
Corrections and additions are welcome.

<H2><A NAME="distributions"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Notes about specific Linux distributions</A>
</H2>

<P>This section is incomplete.  Corrections and additions are welcome.
<P>
<H3>Debian</H3>

<P>Debian uses a System V boot script arrangement.  The PCMCIA startup
script is installed as <CODE>/etc/init.d/pcmcia</CODE>.  New packages use
<CODE>/etc/default/pcmcia</CODE> for startup options; older versions used
<CODE>/etc/pcmcia.conf</CODE> for this purpose.  Debian's syslog
configuration will place kernel messages in <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>
and <CODE>cardmgr</CODE> messages in <CODE>/var/log/daemon.log</CODE>.
<P>Debian distributes the PCMCIA system in two packages: the
``<CODE>pcmcia-cs</CODE>'' package contains <CODE>cardmgr</CODE> and other tools, man
pages, and configuration scripts; and the ``<CODE>pcmcia-modules</CODE>''
package contains the kernel driver modules.
<P>Starting with 3.1.25, a clean PCMCIA install will identify Debian
systems and create a special <CODE>network.opts</CODE> file that, in the
absence of other network configuration settings, uses Debian's
<CODE>ifup</CODE> and <CODE>ifdown</CODE> commands to configure a network card based
on settings in <CODE>/etc/network/interfaces</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>Red Hat, Caldera, Mandrake</H3>

<P>These distributions use a System V boot script organization.  The
PCMCIA startup script is installed as
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia</CODE>, and boot options are kept in
<CODE>/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia</CODE>.  Beware that installing the Red Hat
package may install a default boot option file that has PCMCIA
disabled.  To enable PCMCIA, the ``<CODE>PCMCIA</CODE>'' variable should be
set to ``<CODE>yes</CODE>''.  Red Hat's default <CODE>syslogd</CODE> configuration will
record all interesting messages in <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>.
<P>Red Hat's PCMCIA package contains a replacement for the network setup
script, <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/network</CODE>, which meshes with the Red Hat
<CODE>linuxconf</CODE> configuration system.  This is convenient for the case
where just one network adapter is used, with one set of network
parameters, but does not have the full flexibility of the regular
PCMCIA network script.  Compiling and installing a clean PCMCIA source
distribution will overwrite the network script, breaking the link to
the Red Hat tools.  If you prefer using the Red Hat tools, either use
only Red Hat RPM's, or replace <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/network.opts</CODE> with
the following:

<P>Starting with the 3.1.22 release, the PCMCIA installation script will
automatically append a variant of this to the default
<CODE>network.opts</CODE> file, so this problem should no longer be an issue.
<P>If you do use <CODE>linuxconf</CODE> (or <CODE>netconf</CODE>) to configure your
network interface, leave the ``kernel module'', ``I/O port'', and
``irq'' parameters blank.  Setting these parameters may interfere with
proper operation of the PCMCIA subsystem.
<P>At boot time, when the Red Hat network subsystem starts up, it may say
``Delaying eth0 initialization'' and ``[FAILED]''.  This is actually
not a failure: it means that this network interface will not be
initialized until after the PCMCIA network device is configured.
<P>Red Hat bundles their slightly modified PCMCIA source distribution
with their kernel sources, rather than as a separate source package.
When preparing to build a new set of PCMCIA drivers, you will
generally want to install Red Hat's kernel-source RPM
(<CODE>kernel-source-*.i386.rpm</CODE>), and not the kernel SRPM
(<CODE>kernel-*.src.rpm</CODE>).  The SRPM is tailored for building their
kernel RPM files, which is not exactly what you want.  With Red Hat
7.0, the kernel-source RPM also includes a mis-configured PCMCIA
source tree; if you want to use it, delete their PCMCIA config.out
file and re-do "make config".
<P>
<H3>Slackware</H3>

<P>Slackware uses a BSD boot script arrangement.  The PCMCIA startup
script is installed as <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia</CODE>, and boot options
are specified in <CODE>rc.pcmcia</CODE> itself.  The PCMCIA startup script
is invoked from <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.S</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>SuSE</H3>

<P>SuSE uses a System V init script arrangement, with init scripts stored
under <CODE>/etc/init.d</CODE>.  The PCMCIA startup script is installed as
<CODE>/etc/init.d/pcmcia</CODE>, and startup options are kept in
<CODE>/etc/rc.config</CODE>.  Before release 7.0, init scripts were kept
under <CODE>/sbin/init.d</CODE>.  In early SuSE releases (pre-5.3), the
PCMCIA startup script was somewhat limited and did not allow PCMCIA
startup variables to be overridden from the <CODE>lilo</CODE> boot prompt.
<P>SuSE 8.0 includes both the standalone PCMCIA modules, and the 2.4
kernel PCMCIA subsystem modules.  A new variable, <CODE>PCMCIA_SYSTEM</CODE>,
is available in <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia</CODE> to choose between
these.  It can be set to either ``kernel'' or ``external''.
