<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Open Content Open Publication License</A></H2>

<P>Open Publication License
Draft v1.0, 8 June 1999 (text version)
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS</A>
</H2>

<P>The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in
whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that
the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the
author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.
<P>
<P>Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:
<P>
<P>Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt; by &lt;author's name or
designee&gt;. This material may be distributed only subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y
or later (the latest version is presently available at
http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/). The reference must be
immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or
publisher of the document (see section VI).
<P>
<P>Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
permitted.
<P>
<P>Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the
citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and
author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all
outer surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as
large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to
the title.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 COPYRIGHT</A>
</H2>

<P>The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 SCOPE OF LICENSE</A>
</H2>

<P>The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works,
unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.
<P>
<P>Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall
not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate
work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open
Publication material and appropriate copyright notice.
<P>
<P>SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the
license remain in force.
<P>
<P>NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as
is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but
not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS</A>
</H2>

<P>All modified versions of documents covered by this license,
including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial
documents, must meet the following requirements:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 1. The modified version must be labeled as such.
</LI>
<LI> 2. The person making the modifications must be identified and
the modifications dated.
</LI>
<LI> 3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if
applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation
practices.
</LI>
<LI> 4. The location of the original unmodified document must be
identified.
</LI>
<LI> 5. The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used
to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the
original author's (or authors') permission.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS</A>
</H2>

<P>In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested
from and strongly recommended of redistributors that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy
or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your
intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or
media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated
documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any,
made to the document.
</LI>
<LI> 2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be
either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an
attachment to the document.
</LI>
<LI> 3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM
expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s).
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 LICENSE OPTIONS</A>
</H2>

<P>The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed
document may elect certain options by appending language to the
reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered part
of the license instance and must be included with the license (or its
incorporation by reference) in derived works.
<P>
<P>A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions
without the explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive
modification" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the
document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical
corrections.
<P>
<P>To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively
modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit
permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or copy.
<P>
<P>B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in
whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes
is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright
holder.
<P>
<P>To accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or
derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited
unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.' to the
license reference or copy.
