<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Resource allocation for PCMCIA devices</A>
</H2>

<P>In theory, it should not really matter which interrupt is allocated to
which device, as long as two devices are not configured to use the
same interrupt.  In <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</CODE> you'll find
a place for excluding interrupts that are used by non-PCMCIA devices.
<P>Similarly, there is no way to directly specify the I/O addresses for a
card to use.  The <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</CODE> file allows
you to specify ranges of ports available for use by any card, or to
exclude ranges that conflict with other devices. 
<P>After modifying <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</CODE>, you can reinitialize
<CODE>cardmgr</CODE> with ``<CODE>kill -HUP</CODE>''.
<P>The interrupt used to monitor card status changes is chosen
by the low-level socket driver module (<CODE>i82365</CODE> or <CODE>tcic</CODE>)
before <CODE>cardmgr</CODE> parses <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/config</CODE>, so it is not
affected by changes to this file.  To set this interrupt, use the
<CODE>cs_irq=</CODE> option when the socket driver is loaded, by setting
the <CODE>PCIC_OPTS</CODE> variable in <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia</CODE>.
<P>All the client card drivers have a parameter called <CODE>irq_list</CODE> for
specifying which interrupts they may try to allocate.
These driver options should be set in
your <CODE>/etc/pcmcia/config</CODE> file.  For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
device "serial_cs"
  module "serial_cs" opts "irq_list=8,12"
  ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>would specify that the serial driver should only use irq 8 or irq 12.
Regardless of <CODE>irq_list</CODE> settings, Card Services will never
allocate an interrupt that is already in use by another device, or an
interrupt that is excluded in the config file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 PCI interrupt configuration problems and solutions</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Most of the following discussion applies to 2.2 and earlier kernels.
With 2.4 and later kernels, the PCI subsystem has more complete
responsibility for PCI interrupt management.  The following tips may
help diagnose a problem, though some workarounds described here may
not be available.
<P>
<H3>An overview of PCI interrupt routing issues</H3>

<P>Each PCI slot has four PCI interrupt pins, INTA through INTD.  Single
function devices will only use the INTA pin; multifunction devices may
use multiple INT pins.  On the processor side, on x86 single processor
systems, incoming hardware interrupts are directed to interrupt
requests (irq's) numbered 0..15.  The PCI interrupt router, usually
part of the PCI-to-ISA host bridge, determines how incoming PCI
interrupts are mapped to CPU irq numbers.  Most modern bridge chips
have several PCI interrupt inputs, known as PIRQ1, PIRQ2, etc, each of
which can be routed to any CPU irq number.  So we might have something
like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
PCI slot 1 INTA --> router PIRQ1 --> CPU irq 9
PCI slot 1 INTB --> router PIRQ2 --> CPU irq 10

PCI slot 2 INTA --> router PIRQ2 --> CPU irq 10
PCI slot 2 INTB --> router PIRQ1 --> CPU irq 9
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Multiple INT pins are often connected to the same PIRQ pin.  Usually,
the connections from INT pins to PIRQ pins are arranged to spread
installed devices out as much as possible, to give the OS the most
flexibility for choosing how interrupts are shared.  The mapping from
bridge PIRQ pins to CPU irq numbers can be obtained by reading
registers in the interrupt router.  The mapping from INT pins to the
router's PIRQ pins, however, depends on how the board designer decided
to connect things up, and cannot be directly determined by driver
software.
<P>For most PCI devices, the OS does not need to understand the interrupt
router details.  Each PCI device has a configuration register, the PCI
Interrupt Line Register, that the BIOS initializes with the
appropriate CPU irq number for that device.  Unfortunately, the BIOS
generally will not configure PCI interrupts for CardBus bridge devices.
<P>The PCI BIOS's Interrupt Routing Table is a data structure that
contains information about the mapping from PCI INT pins to the PIRQ
pins on the PCI interrupt router.  The routing information in the
table is stored in a somewhat unhelpful form, however.  For each
device's INT pins, the table specifies a ``link value''.  All
interrupts with the same link value are wired to the same PIRQ pin;
however, the meaning of the link values is defined by the chipset
vendor.
<P>Several tools are available for examining PCI interrupt routing
information:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>lspci</CODE>, <CODE>/proc/pci</CODE></B><DD><P>These will show you resource information (including interrupt
assignments, where they are known) for all your PCI devices.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>dump_pirq</CODE></B><DD><P>This is in the <CODE>debug-tools</CODE> directory of the PCMCIA source
distribution.  It dumps the contents of your PCI interrupt routing
table, if available.  It also scans for known interrupt routers and
dumps their current interrupt steering settings.
<P>
</DL>
<P>Several PCMCIA module parameters affect PCI interrupt routing:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>pcmcia_core</CODE> module: <CODE>cb_pci_irq=n</CODE></B><DD><P>This option specifies one interrupt number to be used to program the
PCI interrupt router for all CardBus sockets that do not already have
an interrupt assignment. It only has any effect on systems that have a
PCI irq routing table, and a known interrupt router.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>i82365</CODE> module: <CODE>irq_mode=n</CODE></B><DD><P>Most CardBus bridges offer several methods for delivering interrupts
to the host.  The i82365 module by default assumes that a bridge can
deliver both PCI and ISA interrupts, since this is normal for laptops.
A setting of ``<CODE>irq_mode=0</CODE>'' can be used to force a bridge to use only
PCI interrupts.  See the man page for the <CODE>i82365</CODE> module for a
description of what other values mean for different bridge types.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>i82365</CODE> module: <CODE>irq_list=n,n,...</CODE></B><DD><P>This parameter lists which ISA interrupt(s) can be used for PCMCIA.
If no ISA interrupts are available, specify ``<CODE>irq_list=0</CODE>''.  Note
that ``<CODE>irq_mode=0</CODE>'' implies ``<CODE>irq_list=0</CODE>''.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>i82365</CODE> module: <CODE>pci_irq_list=n,n,...</CODE></B><DD><P>This option specifies a list of PCI interrupt numbers to use for
CardBus sockets.  It differs from <CODE>cb_pci_irq</CODE>, because it does not
actually program the PCI interrupt router; it can be used when you
know the PCI interrupts are already set up a certain way, even if you
do not know how the router works.
<P>
</DL>
<P>If you are having problems that you think may be related to PCI
interrupt configuration, you should first verify that you have a
reasonably current PCMCIA driver package.  Also carefully look at the
startup messages when the PCMCIA kernel modules are loaded.  You
should see something like:

<P>The Lucent/SCM PCI-to-CardBus adapters seem to confuse the PCI BIOS on
some older systems.  Lucent says that this card is only supported
on systems that have a BIOS that supports the PCI 2.2 specification,
or are PC99 compliant.  Some older systems will not detect the Lucent
card at all, and if the system can't detect it, the Linux drivers
cannot use it.  The only possible resolutions are a BIOS upgrade, or
using a different motherboard or CardBus adapter.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="irqmode"></A> PCI interrupt delivery problems </H3>

<P>
<P>Symptoms:
<UL>
<LI>Cards seem to be configured correctly, but do not work.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> shows a count of 0 for interrupts
assigned to PCMCIA drivers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>CardBus bridges usually support two types of interrupts, PCI and ISA.
Partly for historical reasons, it has become conventional to use PCI
interrupts for signaling card insertion and removal events, and for
CardBus card interrupts; and ISA interrupts for 16-bit cards.  Since
version 3.1.9, this is the scheme that the Linux PCMCIA system will
use by default.  Most CardBus bridges support multiple methods for
delivering interrupts to the host CPU.  Methods include ``parallel''
interrupts, where each supported irq has a dedicated pin on the
bridge; various serial interrupt protocols, where one or two pins are
used to communicate with an interrupt controller; and hybrids, where
PCI interrupts might be signalled using dedicated pins, while ISA
interrupts are delivered via a serial controller.
<P>In general, it is the responsibility of the BIOS to program a bridge
for the appropriate interrupt delivery method.  However, there are
systems that do this incorrectly, and in some cases, there is no way
for software to safely detect the correct delivery method.  The
<CODE>i82365</CODE> module reports the bridge mode at startup time, and has a
parameter, <CODE>irq_mode</CODE>, that can be used to reconfigure it.  Not all
bridges support this parameter, and the meaning of <CODE>irq_mode</CODE>
depends on the bridge type.  See the <CODE>i82365</CODE> man page for a
description of what values are supported by your bridge.  In some
cases, a bridge may function correctly in more than one interrupt
mode.
<P>Most PCMCIA card readers that fit in a PCI bus slot only provide PCI
interrupt routing.  The Linux drivers assume that all bridges have ISA
interrupt capability, since that is generally correct on laptops.
With a card reader, it will generally be necessary to use the
<CODE>irq_mode</CODE> parameter to specify a ``PCI only'' interrupt delivery
mode; the value of the parameter depends on the bridge type, so check
the <CODE>i82365</CODE> man page.  A few PCI card readers require an
<CODE>irq_mode</CODE> that permits ISA interrupts, but those interrupts are
not actually connected; in that case, use ``<CODE>irq_list=0</CODE>''.
<P>Check the system log and verify that the CardBus bridge has a PCI
interrupt assignment.  If it does not, then resolve that problem
first, then return here if the symptoms persist.  Next, experiment
with different values for the <CODE>irq_mode</CODE> parameter.
<P>
<H3>No PCI interrupt assignment; valid routing table</H3>

<P>
<P>Symptoms:
<UL>
<LI>The Intel PCIC probe reports ``no pci irq'' for each socket.</LI>
<LI>There is a routing table, and the router type is supported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When a routing table is present, the <CODE>pcmcia_core</CODE> module will try
to automatically configure the PCI interrupt router, but only does so
when it has a safe and unambiguous choice for what PCI interrupt to
use.  If there are several valid choices, then you must use the
``<CODE>cb_pci_irq=...</CODE>'' option to specify which interrupt to assign.
Your best bet is to pick the most lightly used interrupt that is
already assigned to another PCI device.
<P>Moving the card to another slot sometimes offers a quick solution.  If
that slot shares its interrupt with an already-configured device, then
the PCMCIA drivers will have no trouble figuring out the assignment.
<P>
<H3>No PCI interrupt assignment; unknown interrupt router</H3>

<P>
<P>Symptoms:
<UL>
<LI>The Intel PCIC probe reports ``no pci irq'' for each socket.</LI>
<LI>There is a routing table, but the router is an unknown type.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Adding support for a new interrupt router is tricky but not a big
job.  First determine, from a datasheet, how your interrupt router
steers PCI interrupts.  Then, see if you can guess the meaning of the
link values from the output of <CODE>dump_pirq</CODE>.  Usually this is
reasonably obvious.  Most routers have four PIRQ pins, and the link
values might be something like 1,2,3,4, or 0x10,0x18,0x20,0x28, or
0x60,0x61,0x62,0x63.  The values are usually chosen so that they can
be easily converted to the location of the appropriate interrupt
steering register.  Finally, add small functions to
<CODE>modules/pci_fixup.c</CODE> to get/set the interrupt steering
information for this router, using the other routers as examples.
<P>
<H3>No PCI interrupt assignment; no routing table</H3>

<P>
<P>Symptoms:
<UL>
<LI>The Intel PCIC probe reports ``no pci irq'' for each socket.</LI>
<LI>No interrupt routing table is found.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Without an interrupt routing table, we cannot tell how interrupts from
the CardBus bridge are directed to CPU irq numbers.  All hope is not
lost: you may be able to guess the PCI interrupt assignment and use
the ``<CODE>pci_irq_list=...</CODE>'' option to pass this information to the
<CODE>i82365</CODE> module.  Good guesses might include the interrupt(s)
assigned to other PCI devices, the interrupt(s) used under Windows, or
any other interrupts that are unaccounted for.
<P>You may also want to experiment with putting the adapter in different
PCI slots, for each <CODE>pci_irq_list</CODE> you try.  You are trying to find
a slot that shares its interrupt with an already-configured device,
and might need to try several slots to find one.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 How can I have separate device setups for home and work?</A>
</H2>

<P>This is fairly easy using ``scheme'' support.
Use two configuration schemes, called ``home'' and ``work''.  Here is
an example of a <CODE>network.opts</CODE> script with scheme-specific
settings:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
case "$ADDRESS" in
work,*,*,*)
    # definitions for network card in work scheme
    ...
    ;;
home,*,*,*|default,*,*,*)
    # definitions for network card in home scheme
    ...
    ;;
esac
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first part of a device address is always the configuration
scheme.  In this example, the second ``case'' clause will select for
both the ``home'' and ``default'' schemes.  So, if the scheme is unset
for any reason, it will default to the ``home'' setup.
<P>Now, to select between the two sets of settings, run either:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cardctl scheme home
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cardctl scheme work
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <CODE>cardctl</CODE> command does the equivalent of shutting down all your
cards and restarting them.  The command can be safely executed whether
or not the PCMCIA system is loaded, but the command may fail if you
are using other PCMCIA devices at the time (even if their
configurations are not explicitly dependant on the scheme setting).
<P>To find out the current scheme setting, run:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cardctl scheme
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>By default, the scheme setting is persistent across boots.  This can
have undesirable effects if networking is initialized for the wrong
environment.  Optionally, you can set the initial scheme value with
the <CODE>SCHEME</CODE> startup option (see 
<A HREF="PCMCIA-HOWTO-2.html#startup">Startup options</A> for details).  It is also possible to set the scheme from
the <CODE>lilo</CODE> boot prompt.  Since <CODE>lilo</CODE> passes unrecognized
options to <CODE>init</CODE> as environment variables, a value for <CODE>SCHEME</CODE>
(or any other PCMCIA startup option) at the boot prompt will be
propagated into the PCMCIA startup script.
<P>To save even more keystrokes, schemes can be specified in <CODE>lilo</CODE>'s
configuration file.  For instance, you could have:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root = /dev/hda1
read-only
image = /boot/vmlinuz
  label  = home
  append = "SCHEME=home"
image = /boot/vmlinuz
  label  = work
  append = "SCHEME=work"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Typing ``home'' or ``work'' at the boot prompt would then boot into
the appropriate scheme.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Booting from a PCMCIA device</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Having the root filesystem on a PCMCIA device is tricky because the
Linux PCMCIA system is not designed to be linked into the kernel.  Its
core components, the loadable kernel modules and the user mode cardmgr
daemon, depend on an already running system.  The kernel's
``initrd'' facility works around this requirement by
allowing Linux to boot using a temporary ram disk as a minimal root
image, load drivers, and then re-mount a different root filesystem.
The temporary root can configure PCMCIA devices and then re-mount a
PCMCIA device as root.
<P>The initrd image absolutely must reside on a bootable device: this
generally cannot be put on a PCMCIA device.  This is a BIOS
limitation, not a kernel limitation.  It is useful here to distinguish
between ``boot-able'' devices (i.e., devices that can be booted), and
``root-able'' devices (i.e., devices that can be mounted as root).
``Boot-able'' devices are determined by the BIOS, and are generally
limited to internal floppy and hard disk drives.  ``Root-able''
devices are any block devices that the kernel supports once it has
been loaded.  The initrd facility makes more devices ``root-able'',
not ``boot-able''. 
<P>Some Linux distributions will allow installation to a device connected
to a PCMCIA SCSI adapter, as an unintended side-effect of their
support for installs from PCMCIA SCSI CD-ROM devices.  However, at
present, no Linux installation tools support configuring an
appropriate ``initrd'' to boot Linux with a PCMCIA root filesystem.
Setting up a system with a PCMCIA root thus requires that you use
another Linux system to create the ``initrd'' image.  If another Linux
system is not available, another option would be to temporarily
install a minimal Linux setup on a non-PCMCIA drive, create an initrd
image, and then reinstall to the PCMCIA target.
<P>The Linux Bootdisk-HOWTO has some general information about setting up
boot disks but nothing specific to initrd.  The main initrd document
is included with recent kernel source code distributions, in
<CODE>linux/Documentation/initrd.txt</CODE>.  Before beginning, you should
read this document.  A familiarity with <CODE>lilo</CODE> is also helpful.
Using initrd also requires that you have a kernel compiled with
<CODE>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM</CODE> and <CODE>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD</CODE> enabled.
<P>This is an advanced configuration technique, and requires a high level
of familiarity with Linux and the PCMCIA system.  Be sure to read all
the relevant documentation before starting.  The following cookbook
instructions should work, but deviations from the examples will
quickly put you in uncharted and ``unsupported'' territory, and you
will be on your own. 
<P>This method absolutely requires that you use a PCMCIA driver release
of 2.9.5 or later.  Older PCMCIA packages or individual components
will not work in the initrd context.  Do not mix components from
different releases.
<P>
<H3>The pcinitrd helper script</H3>

<P>The <CODE>pcinitrd</CODE> script creates a basic initrd image for booting with
a PCMCIA root partition.  The image includes a minimal directory
heirarchy, a handful of device files, a few binaries, shared
libraries, and a set of PCMCIA driver modules.  When invoking
<CODE>pcinitrd</CODE>, you specify the driver modules that you want to be
included in the image.  The core PCMCIA components, <CODE>pcmcia_core</CODE>
and <CODE>ds</CODE>, are automatically included.
<P>As an example, say that your laptop uses an i82365-compatible
host controller, and you want to boot Linux with the root filesystem
on a hard drive attached to an Adaptec SlimSCSI adapter.  You could
create an appropriate initrd image with:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pcinitrd -v initrd pcmcia/i82365.o pcmcia/aha152x_cs.o
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To customize the initrd startup sequence, you could mount the image
using the ``loopback'' device with a command like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mount -o loop -t ext2 initrd /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and then edit the <CODE>linuxrc</CODE> script.  The configuration files
will be installed under <CODE>/etc</CODE> in the image, and can also be
customized.  See the man page for <CODE>pcinitrd</CODE> for more information.
<P>
<H3>Creating an initrd boot floppy</H3>

<P>
<P>After creating an image with <CODE>pcinitrd</CODE>, you can create a boot
floppy by copying the kernel, the compressed initrd image, and a few
support files for <CODE>lilo</CODE> to a clean floppy.  In the following
example, we assume that the desired PCMCIA root device is
<CODE>/dev/sda1</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mke2fs /dev/fd0
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/etc /mnt/boot /mnt/dev
cp -a /dev/fd0 /dev/sda1 /mnt/dev
cp [kernel-image] /mnt/vmlinuz
cp /boot/boot.b /mnt/boot/boot.b
gzip &lt; [initrd-image] > /mnt/initrd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Create <CODE>/mnt/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> with the contents:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
boot=/dev/fd0
compact
image=/vmlinuz
    label=linux
    initrd=/initrd
    read-only
    root=/dev/sda1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finally, invoke lilo with:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
lilo -r /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When <CODE>lilo</CODE> is invoked with <CODE>-r</CODE>, it performs all actions
relative to the specified alternate root directory.  The reason for
creating the device files under <CODE>/mnt/dev</CODE> was that <CODE>lilo</CODE>
will not be able to use the files in <CODE>/dev</CODE> when it is running
in this alternate-root mode.
<P>
<H3>Installing an initrd image on a non-Linux drive</H3>

<P>One common use of the initrd facility would be on systems where the
internal hard drive is dedicated to another operating system.  The
Linux kernel and initrd image can be placed in a non-Linux partition,
and <CODE>lilo</CODE> or <CODE>LOADLIN</CODE> can be set up to boot Linux from these
images.
<P>Assuming that you have a kernel has been configured for the
appropriate root device, and an initrd image created on another
system, the easiest way to get started is to boot Linux using
<CODE>LOADLIN</CODE>, as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
LOADLIN &lt;kernel> initrd=&lt;initrd-image>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once you can boot Linux on your target machine, you could then
install <CODE>lilo</CODE> to allow booting Linux directly.
For example, say that <CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE> is the non-Linux target
partition and <CODE>/mnt</CODE> can be used as a mount point.  First,
create a subdirectory on the target for the Linux files:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/linux
cp [kernel-image] /mnt/linux/vmlinuz
cp [initrd-image] /mnt/linux/initrd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this example, say that <CODE>/dev/sda1</CODE> is the desired Linux root
partition, a SCSI hard drive mounted via a PCMCIA SCSI adapter.  To
install <CODE>lilo</CODE>, create a <CODE>lilo.conf</CODE> file with the contents:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
boot=/dev/hda
map=/mnt/linux/map
compact
image=/mnt/linux/vmlinuz
        label=linux
        root=/dev/sda1
        initrd=/mnt/linux/initrd
        read-only
other=/dev/hda1
        table=/dev/hda
        label=windows
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <CODE>boot=</CODE> line says to install the boot loader in the master boot
record of the specified device.  The <CODE>root=</CODE> line identifies the
desired root filesystem to be used after loading the initrd image, and
may be unnecessary if the kernel image is already configured this way.
The <CODE>other=</CODE> section is used to describe the other operating system
installed on <CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE>.
<P>To install <CODE>lilo</CODE> in this case, use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
lilo -C lilo.conf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that in this case, the <CODE>lilo.conf</CODE> file uses absolute paths
that include <CODE>/mnt</CODE>.  I did this in the example because the target
filesystem may not support the creation of Linux device files for the
<CODE>boot=</CODE> and <CODE>root=</CODE> options.
<P>
