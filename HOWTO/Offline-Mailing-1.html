<P>In this chapter i'm just going to put myself safe for any damages and
flames - since even *I* could be wrong ... If you got any questions or
suggestions to add to this faq, even if you find any faults - there is a
feedback section in it ...
<P>Some "need to know" point is, all filenames &amp; files/types are indicated
with the line:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>(*** &lt; file &gt; *** text ***)     .procmailrc</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This means, this is a file, called ".procmailrc" containing text. The text
variable can also be code. It shows you what name of file to use. Without
a path means it can be variable/choosen by you (in the most cases this
files resists in the homedirectory of the mail"user" like /home/mailer).

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 What am i using ?</A>
</H2>

<P>I'm using Linux 2.0.30, Pentium-166, ATI pci-mach64 card, Accelerated-X
(Metro) and a connection to my isp (currently ibmnet) via ppp using a ZyXEL
28k8 modem, and occasionally a Bausch 28k8. 
<P>Now i upgraded to Linux 2.0.33, installed a USRobotics modem, it still
works as it should work :) (everybody should upgrade their linux versions
as soon there comes out a patch :) believe me :) you could spare a lot of
time &amp; seeking for errors when doing this one :)
