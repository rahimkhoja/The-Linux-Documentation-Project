<P> This section is still being developed as the usage on my cluster
evolves, but so far we tend to write our own sets of message passing
routines to communicate between processes on different machines.  </P>
<P> Many applications, particularly in the computational genomics
areas, are massively and trivially parallelisable, meaning that
perfect distribution can be achieved by spreading tasks equally across
the machines (for example, when analysing a whole genome using a
technique that operates on a single gene/protein, each processor can
work on one gene/protein at a time independent of all the other
processors). </P>
<P> So far we have not found the need to use a professional queueing
system, but obviously that is highly dependent on the type of
applications you wish to run. </P>

<P> For the single most important program we run (our <I>ab
initio</I> protein folding simulation program), using the Pentium 3 1
GHz processor machine as a frame of reference, on average: </P>

Xeon    1.7 GHz processor is about 22% slower
Athlon  1.2 GHz processor is about 36% faster
Athlon  1.5 GHz processor is about 50% faster
Athlon  1.7 GHz processor is about 63% faster
Xeon    2.4 GHz processor is about 45% faster
Xeon    2.7 GHz processor is about 80% faster
Opteron 1.4 GHz processor is about 70% faster
Opteron 1.6 GHz processor is about 88% faster

<P> Yes, the Athlon 1.5 GHz is faster than the Xeon 1.7 GHz since the
Xeon executes only six instructions per clock (IPC) whereas the Athlon
executes nine IPC (you do the math!). This is however an highly
non-rigourous comparison since the executables were each compiled on
the machines (so the quality of the math libraries for example will
have an impact) and the supporting hardware is different. </P>

</H2>

<P> These machines are incredibly stable both in terms of hardware and
software once they have been debugged (usually some in a new batch of
machines have hardware problems), running constantly under very heavy
loads.  One common example is given below. Reboots have generally
occurred when a circuit breaker is tripped.</P>
