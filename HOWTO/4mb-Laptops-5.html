<H2><A NAME="s5">5. The Installation</A> </H2>

<P>This section does not give much detail on the Slackware installation process.
In fact, it assumes you are familiar with it. Instead, this section concentrates
on those areas where special care or unusual steps are required.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Boot the machine</A>
 </H2>

<P>Make a boot-disk from one of the images. I recommend you use bareapm.i
on a laptop and bare.i on a desktop - unless you have a parallel-port IDE device
(pportide.i). Boot the laptop from it. When the boot: prompt appears, type
"mount root=/dev/hdax" where x is the temporary root partition. Log in as root.
Then activate the swap partition.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Floppy/Parport CD-ROM Install</A>
 </H2>

<P>In both these cases, no extra work should be necessary to access the installation
media. Simply run setup.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Network/PCMCIA Install</A>
 </H2>

<P>Slackware has supplementary disks with tools for these and instructions
for their use greet you when you log in. Use the network disk on a desktop
PC with ethernet card or a laptop with pocket ethernet adaptor. Use the PCMCIA
disk for PCMCIA install. Once your network adapter/PCMCIA socket has been identified,
run setup.
<H3>PCMCIA install on the Aero </H3>

<P>The Slackware installation process runs the PCMCIA drivers from the supplementary
floppy. Because the Aero has a PCMCIA floppy drive, this means you can't remove
the floppy drive to insert the PCMCIA CD-ROM/ethernet card. The solution is
simple: the Slackware PCMCIA setup routine creates /pcmcia and mounts the supplementary
disk there, so
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Create the /pcmcia directory yourself</LI>
<LI>Mount the supplementary disk to /mnt. Be sure to specify the type as vfat
- if you don't, it'll be incorrectly identified as UMSDOS and long filenames
will be mis-copied.</LI>
<LI>cd /mnt;cp -dpPr ./* /pcmcia/</LI>
<LI>Unmount the floppy.</LI>
<LI>Run pcmcia. When the script complains that there is no disk in the drive
simply hit Enter: Card Sevices will start. Connect your PCMCIA device and hit
Enter.</LI>
<LI>Run setup</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Set-up</A>
 </H2>

<P>The Slackware set-up program is straightforward. Start with the Keymap
section and it'll take you forward step by step.
<H3>AddSwap </H3>

<P>You do need to do this step so it can put the correct entry in fstab but
make sure it doesn't run mkswap - you're already using the partition.
<H3>Target </H3>

<P>In this section Slackware asks which partitions will be mounted as what
and then formats them if you want.
<P>The safest bet here is to leave your temporary root partition out altogether
and just edit fstab later once you know you don't need it for it's temporary
purpose anymore. If you're going to reuse it as /home then it is OK to designate
it as /home - obviously, don't format it now! If you intend to re-use it as
a part of the directory structure that will have files placed in it during
installation (/var, for example) then you absolutely must ignore it in this
step: after the installation is complete you can move the files across.
<H3>Select </H3>

<P>Here you choose which general categories of software to install. I chose
as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A - Base Linux System</LI>
<LI>AP -Non-X applications</LI>
<LI>F - FAQs and HOWTOs</LI>
<LI>N - Networking tools and apps</LI>
<LI>Y - BSD games collection</LI>
</UL>
<P>I wouldn't recommend adding to this - if anything, prune it back to A,
AP and N. That gives you a core Linux setup to which you can add according
to your needs.
<H3><A NAME="sec:installpackages"></A> Install </H3>

<P>Choose the Expert installation method. This allows you to select/reject
for installation individual packages from the categories you chose in the Selection
step. 
<A HREF="4mb-Laptops-7.html#sec:appendixA">Appendix A</A> goes through the precise choices I made .
<P>This part takes about 3 hours for a PCMCIA network install. You are prompted
to select individual packages before the installation of each category, so
you can't just walk away and leave it to run through.
<H3>Configure </H3>

<P>Once the packages are all installed, you are prompted to do final configuration
for your machine. This covers areas like networking, Lilo, selecting a kernel
etc. Some points to look out for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you did a PCMCIA install, don't accept the offer to configure your network
with netconfig. This will ruin your pcmcia networking. Wait until you've rebooted
and then edit /etc/pcmcia/network.opts</LI>
<LI>This is the point where you should install a kernel. For a laptop the bareapm
kernel is best, for a desktop simply the bare one.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Exit </H3>

<P>The set-up process is finished but you are not.<B> Do not reboot yet! </B>There
is another vital step to complete.
<H2><A NAME="sec:prebootconfig"></A> <A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Pre-reboot Configuration</A>
 </H2>

<P>On a normal machine you would simply reboot once the installation is complete.
If you do that here you may have to wait 6 or 8 hours for a login prompt to
appear and another half hour to get to the command prompt. Before rebooting
you need to change or remove the elements that cause this slowdown. This involves
editing config files so you need to be familiar with vi, ed or sed. 
<P>At this stage your future root partition is still mounted as /mnt so remember
to at that to the paths given here.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>/etc/passwd</B><DD><P>Edit this to change root's login shell to ash. ash really
is the only practical login shell for 4mb RAM. 
<DT><B>/etc/rc.d/rc.modules</B><DD><P>Comment out the line 'depmod -a'. You only need
to update module dependencies if you have changed your module configuration
(recompiled or added new ones, for example). On a standard system it only takes
a second or two and so it doesn't matter that it's needlessly performed each
time. On a 4mb laptop it can take as much as 8 hours.
When you do change your
module set-up you can simply uncomment this line and reboot. Alternatively,
change this part of the script so that it will only run if you pass a parameter
at the boot-prompt. For example:
<HR>
<PRE>
if [ "NEWMODULES" == "1" ] ; then 
    depmod -a
fi
  
</PRE>
<HR>
<DT><B>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</B><DD><P>This script starts network services like nfs.
You probably don't need these and certainly not at start-up. Rename this script
to something like RC.inet2 - that will stop it from being run at boot and you
can run it manually when you need it.
<DT><B>/etc/rc.d/rc.pcmcia</B><DD><P>On the Aero you should also rename this script,
otherwise you'll lose the use of your floppy drive on start-up. It's worth
considering for any other small laptop as well - you can always run it manually
before inserting a card.
</DL>
<P>Once these changes have been made, you are ready to reboot.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Post-reboot Configuration.</A>
 </H2>

<P>If you made the changes recommended in section 
<A HREF="#sec:prebootconfig">Pre-reboot configuration</A> then the boot process will
only take a few minutes, as opposed to several hours. Login as root and check
that everything is functioning properly. 
<H3>Re-use the temporary root. </H3>

<P>Once you are sure the installation is solid you can reclaim the partition
you used as the temporary root. Don't just delete the contents, reformat the
filesystem. Remember, the mke2fs that came with the mini-Linux is out of date.
<P>If you intend to re-use this partition as /home, remember not to create
any user accounts until you have completed this step.
<H3>Other configuration tweaks. </H3>

<P>In such a small RAM space, every little helps. Go through SlackWare's BSD-style
init scripts in /etc/rc.d/ and comment out anything you don't need. Have a
look at Todd Burgess' Small Memory mini-HOWTO 
<A HREF=" http://eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca/~tburgess/"> http://eddie.cis.uoguelph.ca/~tburgess/</A> for more ideas.
