<P>
<OL>
<LI> <B>Does Linux support multi-threading?  If I start two or more
processes, will they be distributed among the available CPUs?</B>
<P>Yes. Processes and kernel-threads are distributed among processors.
User-space threads are not.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>What kind of architectures are supported in SMP?</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>From <B>Alan Cox</B>:</B><DD><P>SMP is supported in 2.0 on the hypersparc (SS20, etc.) systems and Intel
486, Pentium or higher machines which are Intel MP1.1/1.4
compliant. <B>Richard Jelinek</B> adds: right now, systems have been
tested up to 4 CPUs and the MP standard (and so Linux) theoretically
allows up to 16 CPUs.
<P>SMP support for UltraSparc, SparcServer, Alpha and PowerPC machines is
in available in 2.2.x.
<P>
<DT><B>From <B>Ralf Bächle</B>:</B><DD><P>MIPS, m68k and ARM does not
support SMP; the latter two probly won't ever.
<P>That is, I'm going to hack on MIPS-SMP as soon as I get a SMP box ...
</DL>
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>Does SMP distribute the threads among the processors or is the library the one in charge of it?</B>
<P>(<B>Matti Aarnio</B>) The way Linux implements threads is to treat them at scheduling the same way as any process - thread just happens to share several resources of the originating process; memory space, file descriptors. See clone(2) for part of explanation.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>How do I make a Linux SMP kernel?</B>
<P>Most Linux distributions don't provide a ready-made SMP-aware kernel,
which means that you'll have to make one yourself. If you haven't made
your own kernel yet, this is a great reason to learn how.  Explaining
how to make a new kernel is beyond the scope of this document; refer to
the Linux Kernel Howto for more information. (<B>C. Polisher</B>)
<P>
<P>Configure the kernel and answer Y to CONFIG_SMP.
<P>
<P>If you are using LILO, it is handy to have both SMP and non-SMP
kernel images on hand. Edit /etc/lilo.conf to create an entry
for another kernel image called "linux-smp" or something.
<P>
<P>The next time you compile the kernel, when running a SMP kernel,
edit linux/Makefile and change "MAKE=make" to "MAKE=make -jN"
(where N = number of CPU + 1, or if you have tons of memory/swap
you can just use "-j" without a number). Feel free to experiment
with this one.
<P>
<P>Of course you should time how long each build takes :-)
Example:
<HR>
<PRE>
make config
time -v sh -c 'make dep ; make clean install modules modules_install'
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>If you are using some Compaq MP compliant machines you will need to set
the operating system in the BIOS settings to "Unix
<P>
<P>In kernel series 2.0 up to but not including 2.1.132, uncomment the
<CODE>SMP=1</CODE> line in the main Makefile (<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Makefile</CODE>).
<P>In the 2.2 version, configure the kernel and answer "yes" to the
question "Symmetric multi-processing support" (<B>Michael Elizabeth
Chastain</B>).
<P>AND
<P>enable real time clock support by configuring the "RTC support" item (in
"Character Devices" menu) (from <B>Robert G.  Brown</B>). Note that
inserting RTC support actually doesn't afaik prevent the known problem
with SMP clock drift, but enabling this feature prevents lockup when the
clock is read at boot time. A note from <B>Richard Jelinek</B> says
also that activating the Enhanced RTC is necessary to get the second CPU
working (identified) on some original Intel Mainboards.
<P>AND
<P>(x86 kernel) do NOT enable APM (advanced power management)! APM and SMP
are not compatible, and your
system will almost certainly (or at least probably <CODE>;)</CODE>) crash
while booting if APM is enabled (<B>Jakob Oestergaard</B>). <B>Alan
Cox</B> confirms this : 2.1.x turns APM off for SMP boxes.  Basically
APM is undefined in the presence of SMP systems, and anything could
occur.
<P>AND
<P>(x86 kernel) enable "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support". Some
BIOS are buggy as they do not activate cache memory for the second
processor. The MTRR support contains code that solves such processor
misconfiguration.
<P>
<P>You must rebuild all your kernel and kernel modules when changing to and
from SMP mode. Remember to <CODE>make modules</CODE> and <CODE>make
modules_install</CODE> (from <B>Alan Cox</B>).
<P>
<P>If you get module load errors, you probably did not rebuild and/or
re-install your modules.  Also with some 2.2.x kernels people have
reported problems when changing the compile from SMP back to UP
(uni-processor).  To fix this, save your .config file, do <EM>make
mrproper</EM>, restore your <EM>.config</EM> file, then remake your
kernel (<EM>make dep</EM>, etc.)  (<B>Wade Hampton</B>). Do not forget
to run lilo after copying your new kernel.
<P>Recap:

<LI> <B>What is the status of converting the kernel toward finer
grained locking and multithreading?</B>
<P>Linux kernel version 2.2 has signal handling, interrupts and some I/O stuff fine grain
locked.  The rest is gradually migrating. All the scheduling is SMP
safe.
<P>
<P>Kernel version 2.3 (next 2.4) has really fine grained locking. In the 2.3 kernels
the usage of the big kernel lock has basically disappeared, all major
Linux kernel subsystems are fully threaded: networking, VFS, VM, IO,
block/page caches, scheduling, interrupts, signals, etc. (<B>Ingo
Molnar</B>)
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>What has changed between 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels?</B>
<P><B>(Mark Hahn)</B> In many parts of the kernel, there's little relation between 2.2 and 2.4. One of the biggest changes is SMP - not just the evolutionary fine-graining of locks, but the radically revamped VM, memory management, interrupt handling that's basically unrelated to 2.2, fairly revolutionary net changes (thread and zero-copy), etc.
<P>In short, 2.2 doesn't use the hardware like 2.4 does.

<DT><B>Standard kernel</B><DD><P>No and Yes.  There is no way to force a process onto specific CPU's but

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The goal of this project is to make a source compatible and functionally
equivalent version of pset (as defined by SGI - partially removed from
their IRIX 6.4 kernel) for Linux.  This enables users to determine which
processor or set of processors a process may run on.  Possible uses
include forcing threads to separate processors, timings, security (a
`root' only CPU?) and probably more.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is focused around the syscall sysmp().  This function takes a number of
parameters that determine which function is requested.  Functions

<OL>
<LI> <B>Do I really need SMP?</B>
<P>If you have to ask, you probably don't. <CODE>:)</CODE>
Generally, multi-processor systems can provide better performance
than uni-processor systems, but to realize any gains you need
to consider many other factors besides the number of CPU's.
For instance, on a given system, if the processor is generally
idle much of the time due to a slow disk drive, then this system
is "input/output bound", and probably won't benefit from additional
processing power. If, on the other hand, a system has many
simultaneously executing processes, and CPU utilization is very
high, then you are likely to realize increased system performance.
SCSI disk drives can be very effective when used with multiple
processors, due to the way they can process multiple commands
without tying up the CPU. (<B>C. Polisher</B>)
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>Do I get the same performance from 2-300 MHz processors
as from one 600 MHz processor?</B>
<P>This depends on the application, but most likely not.  SMP adds
some overhead that a faster uniprocessor box would not incur
(<B>Wade Hampton</B>).

<P>By the way, you can't monitor processor scheduling precisely with xosview,
as xosview itself causes a scheduling perturbation. (<B>H. Peter
Anvin</B>)
<P>And <B>Rik van Riel</B> tell us why:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The answer is pretty simple. Basically there are 3
processes involved:
<OL>
<LI> the cpu hog  (low scheduling priority because it eats CPU)</LI>
<LI> xosview</LI>
<LI> X</LI>
</OL>

<P>The CPU hog is running on one CPU. Then xosview wakes up
(on the other CPU) and starts sending commands to X, which
wakes up as well.
<P>Since both X and xosview have a much higher priority than
the CPU hog, xosview will run on one CPU and X on the other.
<P>Then xosview stops running and we have an idle CPU --> Linux
moves the CPU hog over to the newly idle CPU  (X is still
running on the CPU our hog was running on just before).

</PRE>
<HR>
<P>With a 2.2 like kernel, see also the file
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/smp.txt</CODE> for specific instruction.
<P>BTW, since running multiple compilers allows a machine with sufficient
memory to use use the otherwise wasted CPU time during I/O caused delays,
<CODE>make MAKE="make -j 2" -j 2</CODE> actually helps even on uniprocessor
boxes (from <B>Ralf Bächle</B>).
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>Why is the time given by the <CODE>time</CODE> command inaccurate?</B>
(from <B>Joel Marchand</B>)
<P>In the 2.0 series, the result given by the <CODE>time</CODE> command is
false. The sum user+system is right *but* the spreading between user and
system time is false. 
<P>More precisely: "The explanation is, that all time spent in processors
other than the boot cpu is accounted as system time.  If you time a
program, add the user time and the system time, then you timing will be
almost right, except for also including the system time that is
correctly accounted for" (<B>Jakob Østergaard</B>).

<P>Section by <B>Jakob Østergaard</B>.
<P>This section is intended to outline what works, and what doesn't when
it comes to programming multi-threaded software for SMP Linux.

<H3>Parallelization methods</H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> POSIX Threads</LI>
<LI> PVM / MPI Message Passing Libraries</LI>
<LI> fork() -- Multiple processes</LI>
</OL>
<P>Since both fork() and PVM/MPI processes usually do not share memory,
but either communicate by means of IPC or a messaging API, they will
not be described further in this section. They are not very specific
to SMP, since they are used just as much - or more - on uniprocessor
computers, and clusters thereof.
<P>
<P>Only POSIX Threads provide us with multiple threads sharing ressources
like - especially - memory. This is the thing that makes a SMP
machine special, allowing many processors to share their memory. To
use both (or more ;) processors of an SMP, use a kernel-thread
library. A good library is the 
<A HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/">LinuxThreads, a pthread library made by Xavier Leroy</A> which is now
integrated with glibc2 (aka libc6).  Newer Linux distributions
include this library by default, hence you do not have to 
obtain a separate package to use kernel threads.
<P>There are implementations of threads (and POSIX threads) that are
application-level, and do not take advantage of the kernel-threading.
These thread packages keep the threading in a single process, 
hence do not take advantage of SMP.  However, they are good for 
many applications and tend to actually run faster than kernel-threads
on single processor systems.
<P>Multi-threading has never been really popular in the UN*X world
though. For some reason, applications requiring multiple processes or
threads, have mostly been written using fork(). Therefore, when using
the thread approach, one runs into problems of incompatible (not
thread-ready) libraries, compilers, and debuggers.  GNU/Linux is no
exception to this. Hopefully the next few sections will sched a little
light over what is currently possible, and what is not.
<P>
<P>
<H3>The C Library</H3>

<P>Older C libraries are not thread-safe. It is very important that you
use GNU LibC (<B>glibc</B>), also known as <B>libc6</B>. Earlier
versions are, of course possible to use, but it will cause you much more
trouble than upgrading your system will, well probably :)
<P>If you want to use GDB to debug your programs, see below.
<P>
<H3>Languages, Compilers and debuggers</H3>

<P>There is a wealth of programming languages available for GNU/Linux,
and many of them can be made to use threads one way or the other
(some languages like Ada and Java even have threads as primitives in
the language).
<P>This section will, however, currently only describe C and C++. If you
have experience in SMP Programming with other languages, please
enlighten us.
<P>GNU C and C++, as well as the EGCS C and C++ compilers work with the
thread support from the standard C library (<B>glibc</B>). There are
however a few issues:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> When compiling C or C++, use the <B>-D_REENTRANT</B> define
in the compiler command line. This is necessary to make certain
error-handling functions work like the errno variable.
</LI>
<LI> When using C++, If two threads throw exceptions concurrently, the
program will segfault.  The compiler does not generate thread-safe
exception code.

The workaround is to put a
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;global_exception_lock) in the constructor(s) of
every class you throw(), and to put the corresponding
pthread_mutex_unlock(...) in the destructor.  It's ugly, but it works.
This solution was given by <B>Markus Ferch</B>.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>The GNU Debugger <B>GDB</B> as of version 4.18, should handle threads
correctly. Most Linux distribution offer a patched, thread-aware gdb.
<P>It is not necessary to patch <B>glibc</B> in any way just to make it
work with threads. If you do not need to debug the software (this
could be true for all machines that are not development workstations),
there is no need to patch <B>glibc</B>.
<P>Note that core-dumps are of no use when using multiple
threads. Somehow, the core dump is attached to one of the currently
running threads, and not to the program as a whole. Therefore,
whenever you are debugging anything, run it from the debugger.
<P><B>Hint:</B> If you have a thread running haywire, like eating 100%
CPU time, and you cannot seem to figure out why, here is a nice way to
find out what's going on: Run the program straight from the shell, no
GDB. Make the thread go haywire. Use <B>top</B> to get the PID of
the process.  Run GDB like <B>gdb program pid</B>. This will make
GDB attach itself to the process with the PID you specified, and stop
the thead. Now you have a GDB session with the offending thread, and
can use <B>bt</B> and the like to see what is happening.
<P>
<H3>Other libraries</H3>

<P><B>ElectricFence:</B> This library is not thread safe. It should
be possible, however, to make it work in SMP environments by inserting
mutex locks in the ElectricFence code.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 MultiProcessor Specification Support (MPS)</A>
</H2>

<P>(<B>Randy Dunlap</B>) Linux supports MPS (MP spec.) version 1.1 and 1.4.
<P>Linux doesn't have full support for all of MPS version 1.4.
<P>Experience has shown that Linux usually works best when the BIOS is configure for MP Spec. version 1.1 if that is an option in your system's BIOS. I don't see why the MP Spec. version should matter to Linux,  but it would be an interesting exercise to find out the differences as presented by BIOS tables, to determine why Linux fails with MP Spec. version 1.4 in some cases, and to fix Linux so that this wouldn't matter.
<P>This document summarizes the major changes in MP spec. version 1.4 and their support status in Linux.
<P>
<H3>Symmetric I/O Mode</H3>

<P>The hardware must support a mode of operation in which the system can switch easily to Symmetric I/O mode from PIC or Virtual Wire mode. When the operating system is ready to swtich to MP operation, it writes a 01H to the IMCR register, if that register is implemented, and enables I/O APIC Redirection Table entries. The hardware must not require any other action on the part of software to make the transition to Symmetric I/O mode.
<P>
<P>Linux recognizes and supports this MP configuration mode.
<P>
<H3>Floating Point Exception Interrupt</H3>

<P>For PC/AT compatibility, the bootstrap processor must support DOS-compatible FPU execution and exception handling while running in either of the PC/AT-compatible modes. This means that floating point error signals from the BSP must be routed to the interrupt request 13 signal, IRQ13, when the system is in PIC or virtual wire mode. While floating point error signals from an application processor need not be routed to IRQ13, platform designers may choose to connect the two. For example, connecting the floating point error signal from application processors to IRQ13 can be useful in the case of a platform that supports dynamic choice of BSP during boot.
<P>In symmetric mode, a compliant system supports only on-chip floating point units, with error signaling via interrupt vector 16. Operating systems must use interrupt vector 16 to manage floating point exceptions when the system is in symmetric mode. 
<P>Linux does not use the floating point interrupt at all except in genuine i386 processor systems which are not SMP-capable.  [In these systems, if they wire the FPU exception line in the PC/AT-compatible way, a run-time check for #MF exception availability is performed. If the #MF exception is available, then Linux handles this interrupt if it happens.  (<B>Maciej W. Rozycki</B>)
<P>
<H3>Multiple I/O APIC Configurations</H3>

<P>Multiple I/O APICs are supported in Linux.
<P>
<H3>MP Configuration Table</H3>

<P>This table was made optional in MPS version 1.4.  If the table isn't present, one of the default configurations should be used. An extended section was also added to it for new table entry types.
<P>Linux supports the optional MP Configuration Table and uses a default configuration if the MP Config. Table is not present.
<P>Linux tolerates extended section table entries by skipping over them if they are found.  Data in the extended table entries is not used.
<P>
<H3>MP Configuration Table Header Fields</H3>

<P>New or changed fields for MP Spec. version 1.4:
<P>
