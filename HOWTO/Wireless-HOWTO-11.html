<H2><A NAME="s11">11. Appendix B - Siemens DECT Radio Modem </A></H2>

<P>Web Site: 
<A HREF="http://www.siemens.com">http://www.siemens.com</A><P>What's that? These 2 components are not real PC cards but are more like
modems that you use as external device. 
<P>
<PRE>
Host1-serial - RadioModem1 - - - - - RadioModem2 - serial-Host2 
</PRE>
<P>How can I connect it? 
<P>If you see them in an abstract vision you can model them like this: 
<P>
<PRE>
Host1-serial - - NULL MODEM CABLE - - serial-Host2 
</PRE>
<P>So you'd have a connection between 2 far serials with 2 possible configurations:
<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Linux with Windows, Linux has a daemon that answer to a ppp call while
Windows has a Dial up connection under Remote Access. </LI>
<LI>Linux with Linux, where you can run (on all 2 hosts) a ppp connection,
with IP addresses inverted. </LI>
</OL>
<P>For 1 you can use this simple script in Linux: 
<P>&quot;/usr/sbin/pppd -detach lock idle 300 crtscts connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat
-v TIMEOUT 5 AT OK AT OK AT OK AT OK&quot; IPLINUX:IPWINDOWS /dev/ttySx 115200
disconnect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v AT OK&quot; ms-dns IPDNS&quot; 
<P>where: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>/dev/ttySx is your serial port, </LI>
<LI>IPDNS is the IP address of your dns server, </LI>
<LI>IPLINUX is the Linux IP address as IPWINDOWS is the Windows IP address.
 </LI>
</UL>
<P>The above script is need for letting Windows believe there is a modem on
the serial end! 
<P>In Windows you need to create a Dial Up connection with crtscts enabled,
speed at 115200 and with a stupid number to call (need by Remote Access but
absolutely not used). 
<P>With 2 Linux boxes you only have to run a very simple script like this
at each Linux side: 
<P>&quot;/usr/sbin/pppd passive local crtscts IPLINUX1:IPLINUX2 /dev/ttySx
115200 noauth persist&quot; 
<P>where you'll invert IPLINUX1 with IPLINUX2 at the other edge.
<P>Note that you can do authentication even Linux-Windows than in Linux-Linux
if you want.
