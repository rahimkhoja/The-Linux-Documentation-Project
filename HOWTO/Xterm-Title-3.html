<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Dynamic titles</A></H2>

<P>Many people find it useful to set the title of a terminal to reflect
dynamic information, such as the name of the host the user is logged
into, the current working directory, etc.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 xterm escape sequences</A>
</H2>

<P>Window and icon titles may be changed in a running xterm
by using XTerm escape sequences. The following sequences
are useful in this respect:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>ESC]0;<B>string</B>BEL</CODE> -- Set icon name and window title
to <B>string</B></LI>
<LI><CODE>ESC]1;<B>string</B>BEL</CODE> -- Set icon name to <B>string</B></LI>
<LI><CODE>ESC]2;<B>string</B>BEL</CODE> -- Set window title to
<B>string</B></LI>
</UL>

where <CODE>ESC</CODE> is the <B>escape</B> character (\033), and <CODE>BEL</CODE> is
the <B>bell</B> character (\007).
<P>
<P>Printing one of these sequences within the xterm will cause the
window or icon title to be changed. 
<P>
<P><B>Note</B>: these sequences apply to most xterm derivatives,
such as <CODE>nxterm</CODE>, <CODE>color-xterm</CODE> and <CODE>rxvt</CODE>. Other
terminal types often use different escapes; see the
appendix for examples. For the full list of 
xterm escape sequences see the file 
<A HREF="http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/howto/Xterm-Title/ctlseq2.txt">ctlseq2.txt</A>,
which comes with the xterm distribution, or
<A HREF="http://www.giccs.georgetown.edu/~ric/howto/Xterm-Title/xterm.seq">xterm.seq</A>, which comes with the
<A HREF="http://www.rxvt.org/">rxvt</A> distribution.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Printing the escape sequences</A>
</H2>

<P>For information that is constant throughout the lifetime of
this shell, such as host and username, it will suffice to
simply echo the escape string in the shell rc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
echo -n "\033]0;${USER}@${HOST}\007"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

should produce a title like <CODE>username@hostname</CODE>, assuming
the shell variables <CODE>$USER</CODE> and <CODE>$HOST</CODE> are set correctly.
The required options for <CODE>echo</CODE> may vary by shell (see examples
below).
<P>
<P>For information that may change during the shell's lifetime, such
as current working directory, these escapes really need to be
applied every time the prompt changes. 
This way the string is updated with every command you issue and can keep
track of information such as current working directory, username, hostname,
etc. Some shells provide special functions for this purpose, some don't
and we have to insert the title sequences directly into the prompt
string. This is illustrated in the next section.
