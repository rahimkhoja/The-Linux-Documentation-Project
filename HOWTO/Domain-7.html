</H2>

<P>You will want some way for the computers on your network to refer to
one another by name, and also a way for people in the outside world to
refer to your exposed hosts by name. There are several ways to go
about doing this.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="dns-and-isp"></A> DNS On Private Network, ISP Handles Domain</H3>

<P>[ Note: if you have chosen not to implement a private network, go to
section 
<A HREF="#fully-exposed-isp">Fully Exposed Network, Hosted By ISP</A>. ]
<P>
<P>In this configuration, you have delegated responsibility for the
primary DNS authority on your domain to the ISP. You still use DNS
within your private network when hosts there want to talk to one
another. You have given your ISP a list of the names and IP numbers of
all exposed hosts. If you want one externally visible machine, for
instance betty.example.com, to act both as web and FTP server, you
should ask the ISP to make CNAME entries for www.example.com and
ftp.example.com pointing to betty.example.com.
<P>
<P>Set up DNS on your private network gateway machine. This can be done
securely, and makes upgrading easier, should you later decide to host
primary DNS authority for your domain.
<P>
<P>I will assume that you have decided to host DNS from the machine
dns.example.com, which is on the private network gateway, and an alias
for fred.example.com at 192.168.1.1. Some small modifications have to
be made to this configuration if this is not the case. I will not
cover that in this HOWTO unless there is significant interest.
<P>
<P>You will have to download and compile a recent
version of BIND, the Berkeley Internet Name Domain. It is available at
the 
<A HREF="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/">BIND web site</A>. Next, you have to configure the daemon.
Create the following file, <CODE>/etc/named.conf</CODE>:

<P>Note that we are declaring ourselves the master for the example.com
domain. Meanwhile, our ISP is also declaring itself to be the master
for the same domain. This is not a problem, as long as you are careful
about the setup. All of the machines on the private network must use
dns.example.com to perform their name resolution. They must
<EM>not</EM> use the name resolvers of the ISP, as the ISP name server
believes itself to be authoritative over your entire domain, but it
doesn't know the IP numbers or names of any machines on your private
network. Similarly, hosts on exposed IP numbers in your domain
<EM>must</EM> use the ISP name server, not the private name server on
dns.example.com.
<P>

created.

Note that we create entries for machines both within the private

This will prevent your named daemon from answering DNS requests on the
outside interface (all requests from the outside must go through the
ISP's name resolver, not yours).
<P>
<P>
<H3>Non-DNS Resolution On Private Network, ISP Handles Domain</H3>

<P>[ Note: if you have chosen not to implement a private network, go to
section 
<A HREF="#fully-exposed-isp">Fully Exposed Network, Hosted By ISP</A>. ]
<P>
<P>In this configuration, you have decided that your private network is
fairly small and unlikely to change often. You have decided not to use
the centralized database of a DNS server, and instead to maintain the
host resolution separately on each machine. All machines should use
the ISP's DNS server for their host name resolution for machines
beyond the private network gateway. For name resolution on the private
network, a hosts table has to be created. For Linux, this means
entering the names and IP numbers of all of the machines on the
private network into the <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> on each
machine. Any time a new machine is added, or a name or IP number is
changed, this file has to be updated on each Linux box.
<P>
<P>As in section 
<A HREF="#dns-and-isp">DNS Resolution on Private Network, ISP Handles Domain</A>, the list of host names on exposed IP
numbers must be sent to the ISP, and any aliases (such as for www and
ftp names) should be specified so that a CNAME entry can be created by
the ISP.
<P>
<P>
<H3>You Are Primary DNS Authority For Domain</H3>

<P>While you could set up <EM>named</EM> resolution on the exposed hosts, and
private database resolution for the private network, I will not cover
that case. If you're going to be running named for one service, you
ought really to do it for both, just to simplify the configuration. In
this section I will assume that the private network gateway machine is
handling name resolution both for the private network and for outside
requests.
<P>
<P>At the time of this writing, under version 8.2.2 of the BIND package,
there is no way for a single <EM>named</EM> daemon to produce
different answers to requests, depending on which interface the
request arrives on. We want name resolution to act differently if the
query comes from the outside world, because IP numbers on the private
network shouldn't be sent out, but have to be available in answer to
requests from within the private network. There is some discussion of
a new ``views'' keyword which may be added to BIND to fill this need
at a later date, but until that happens, the solution is to run two
<EM>named</EM> daemons with different configurations.
<P>
<P>First, set up the private network domain name server as described in
section 
<A HREF="#dns-and-isp">DNS Resolution on Private Network, ISP Handles Domain</A>. This will be the name resolver visible
from within your private network.
<P>
<P>Next, you have to set up DNS for your domain, as visible to hosts in
the outside world. First, check with your provider to see if they will
delegate reverse lookups of your IP numbers to them. While the
original DNS standard didn't account for the possibility of
controlling reverse DNS on subnets smaller than a class C network, a
workaround has been developed which works with all compliant DNS
clients, and has been outlined in 
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2317.txt">RFC 2317</A>. If
your provider is willing to delegate control of reverse DNS on your IP
block, you will have to determine from them the exact name of the in-addr
pseudo-domain they have chosen to delegate to (the RFC does not offer
a convention they recommend for everyday use), and you will have to
register control for that pseudo-domain. I will assume that the
provider has delegated control to you, and the name of the
pseudo-domain is 8.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa. The provider would create
CNAME entries of the form
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
8.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.     2H IN CNAME 8.8.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.
9.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.     2H IN CNAME 9.8.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.
10.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.    2H IN CNAME 10.8.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.
etc.

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in their zone file for the 1.1.10.in-addr.arpa domain. The
configuration of your 8.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa zone file is given later
in this section.
<P>
<P>If your provider is willing to delegate control of the reverse DNS to
you, they will create CNAME entries in their reverse DNS zone table
for those IP numbers you control, pointing to the corresponding
records in your pseudo-domain, as shown above. If they are not willing
to delegate control to you, you will have to ask them to update their
reverse DNS entries any time you add, delete, or change the name of an
externally visible host in your domain. If the reverse DNS table is
not synchronized with your forward DNS entries, certain services may
generate warnings, or refuse to handle requests issued by machines
affected by the mismatch.
<P>
<P>You now have to create a second <EM>named</EM> setup, this one to handle
requests issued by machines outside the private network gateway. This
setup lists only those hosts and IP numbers which are externally
visible, and responds only to requests on the outside interface of the
private network gateway machine.
<P>
<P>First, create a second configuration file, for instance
<CODE>/etc/named.ext.conf</CODE> for requests from the external
interface. In our example, it might be as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H3>Preparing DNS Before Moving Your Domain</H3>

<P>If you decide to move your domain to a new IP number, either because
you have to change your ISP or because you've changed some details of
your service which require you to move to a new IP number from the
same ISP, you will have to make a few preparations ahead of the move.
<P>
<P>You want to set things up so that the IP number fetched by a DNS
lookup somewhere in the outside world points properly to the original
IP number until you move, and then quickly points to the new IP number
after you move. Remote sites can have cached your IP number, and
subsequent queries may be answered locally from the cache, rather than
querying the appropriate servers. The effect of this might be that
people who had visited your site recently are unable to connect, while
new visitors have no problems, because only the new visitors are
getting valid uncached data. Complicating things further is the fact
that the root-level servers are only updated twice a day, so it's
difficult to time a change to the identities of your primary and
secondary DNS servers in the root servers.
<P>
<P>The easiest way to make the transition is probably to duplicate the
entire site, or at least the publicly visible components of it, on the
new IP number, submit the changes, and then wait for the traffic to
shift completely to the new IP number. This is probably not very
practical, though.
<P>
<P>What you should do first is to arrange with your new ISP (or your
current ISP if you've just changing IP numbers within a single ISP) to
host primary and secondary DNS during the transition. This should be
done at least a day before the move. Ask them to set the TTL on this
record to something appropriately small (for instance, five
minutes). The sample DNS files given earlier in this section all have
TTL values set to 86400 seconds (1 day). If your TTL is longer than
this, you will have to arrange the change that much more in advance of
the move. Ultimately, here's what you have to achieve. If your current
domain information TTL is, say, N hours, then the following have
to be finished more than N hours before the move:
<UL>
<LI>Your domain registration entry must show primary and secondary
DNS on the new ISP's machines in the root database. Allow at least a
day between the time you submit the change and the time the change
enters the database.</LI>
<LI>The new primary and DNS servers should point to the original IP
numbers of your site, with a fairly small TTL.</LI>
</UL>

Note that you cannot accelerate this process by reducing your current
domain TTL value, unless you've also done this at least N hours before
the move.
<P>
<P>Now, you're ready for the move. Move your machines over to the new IP
numbers. Synchronize this with an update of the DNS records on your
ISP to point to the new numbers. Within five minutes (the small TTL
you set for the move), the traffic should have switched over to the
new site. You can now rearrange the DNS authority to your liking,
making yourself primary if that's how you want it, and putting the TTL
back up to a reasonably large value.

</H2>

<P>The configurations described in section 
<A HREF="#setup-nameres">Setting Up Name Resolution</A> have MX records pointing to a
machine ``mail.example.com''. The MX record with the lowest priority
number following tells remote sites where to send email. Other MX
records with higher priority numbers are used as backup email
receivers. These backups will hold the mail for a certain period of
time if the primary email receiver is not able to accept the messages
for some reason. In the examples in that section, I have assumed that
fred.example.com, under its alias of mail.example.com, is handling
email for the domain. If you have chosen to let the ISP handle all of
your email hosting, you should change those MX records to point to the
appropriate ISP machines. Ask your ISP technical support
representative what host names you should use for the MX records in
the various files.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="setup-email"></A> <A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Setting up Electronic Mail</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have chosen to do full electronic mail hosting for your domain,
you'll have to take special actions for email coming from hosts on the
private network, and for allowing transparent mail reading from
anywhere within the private network. Unless you're careful, messages
are likely to sit around for long times if they are waiting on one
host, and the intended recipient is logged on another machine. For
security reasons, I recommend that the incoming email not be
accessible from the externally visible hosts (this might help to
discourage a PHB who wants his desktop machine to be on a real IP,
then wonders why he gets brought down by a ping of death twice a
day). A transparent email sharing system on the private network fairly
straight-forward in sendmail. If anybody wants to provide
<EM>tested</EM> solutions for other mail handling daemons, I welcome
additions.
<P>
<H3>A Solution Using "sendmail"</H3>

<P>In order that email delivered to one host be visible on all machines,
the simplest solution is to export the mail spool directory with
read-write privileges over the entire private network. The private
network gateway machine will also act as mail collector and forwarder
for the entire private network, and so must have root write privileges
to the mail spool drive. The other clients may or may not squash root,
at your discretion. My general security philosophy is not to grant
privileges unless there is a clear reason for it, so I squash root on
the mail spool network drive for all hosts except the private network
gateway machine. This has the effect that root can only read his mail
from that machine, but this is not a particularly serious
handicap. Note that the mail spool drive can be a directory on the
private network gateway machine, exported via NFS, or it can be a
directory on one of the internal servers, exported to the entire
private network. If the mail spool drive is resident on the private
network gateway, there is no issue of squashing root for that
machine. If it is on another server, then note that email will be
undeliverable if that server, the gateway machine, or the network
connecting them, is down.
<P>
<P>For Windows machines on your private network, you may either set up a
POP server on the mail spool host, or use samba to export the mail
spool to those machines. The Windows machines should be configured to
send and retrieve mail under a Linux username, such as
joeuser@example.com, so that the email address host name is the bare
domain name, not a machine name like barney.example.com. The outgoing
SMTP host should be set to the private network gateway machine, which
will be responsible for forwarding the mail and doing any address
rewriting.
<P>
<P>Next, you should configure sendmail to forward email from the machines
on the private network, rewriting the addresses if necessary. Obtain
the latest sources to sendmail from the 
<A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/">sendmail.org WWW site</A>. Compile
the binaries, then go to the <CODE>cf/domain</CODE> subdirectory
within the sendmail source tree, and create the following new file:
<CODE>example.com.m4</CODE>

In this example we have disabled the ``expn'' and ``vrfy''

names like ``staff'', ``allstaff'', ``office'', and so on, until he
hits an alias which expands out several usernames for him. He can then
try the usernames against certain weak passwords in hopes of getting
in (assuming he can get a login prompt - the security settings
described in section

some older versions of many daemons. If your FTP site does not require
anonymous users to upload files, be sure to disable that feature in
the daemon. I recommend that user (non-anonymous) FTP logins not be
permitted on the FTP host, that you require your regular users to use
scp, the secure shell remote copy command, for any file updating they
may have to do on the FTP host. This is to help build secure habits in
