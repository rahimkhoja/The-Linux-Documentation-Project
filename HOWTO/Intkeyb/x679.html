>No LANG=language statement is necessary in your bash_profile. You may use 
the Xmodmap file with standard ISO8859-2 keycode definitions and the  
.Xmodmap file (not from the legacy solution). Unfortunately, 
although you may immediately start writing with ISO8859-2 keycodes, the 
dead keys are not working properly and export LANG=language does not work 
here in order to make these dead keys work. There's also some bug with fonts 
or something - KDE 2.0 (or older XFree86 does not properly handle ISO8859-2 
fonts together with Xmodmap. Old kedit, newest GNOME's gedit and StarOffice 5.2
work well (after applying the above script for StarOffice 5.2).</P
><P
>After copying the Compose file from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-2/
to the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/, you may start elegantly 
working with dead keys. This was also tested on StarOffice 5.2.</P

the xmodmap command on your xmodmap keyboard definition and you are ready 
to go. It is a good idea to install support for your national language 
in Yast2, if there is a problem.</P

><P
>Yes, it works as it should - I used the "kcmshell Personalization/kcmlayout", 
command, which is in the menu in Configuration &#62; KDE &#62; Personalization &#62; 
keyboard layout and after just putting the LANG=language statement in 
my .bash_profile, StarOffice worked immediately (with ISO8859-2 fonts 
added to its directory) and I only switched the keyboards. I chose 
Czechoslovakian as the second language and could write in Czech with ISO8859-2 
characters on my screen. (I used the script for putting the ISO8859-2 fonts 
for StarOffice). Unfortunatelly, the KDE 2.0 kedit could not visualize the 
ISO8859-2 fonts and after switching the keyboard and selecting ISO8859-2 
charset I saw this: ??????? instead of lcaron, scaron, etc., but *acute 
symbols (uacute, aacute, etc.) displayed well.</P
><P
>The maps in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols can be modified on the fly,
but this is a dirtier way than to modify Xmodmap maps. You switch keyboards from 
the panel flag icon. </P

>Apply the standard .Xmodmap keycodes (scaron, lcaron, not "threequarters" 
or "mu", etc.) and issue the command: "xmodmap  /.Xmodmap" and you may 
work by switching the keyboards by pressing Scroll Lock (if you use my 
Xmodmap file; if you use other Xmodmap file, try right Alt or whatever else
that is defined in the Xmodmap file).</P

>The FontPath statement in /etc/X11/XF86Config and /etc/X11/XF86Config
does not have to be changed:</P
><P
>FontPath "unix/:1"</P
><P
>The XFree86 reads automatically your fonts, but I put the ISO8859-2 fonts to
/usr/share/fonts directory (same as in RedHat). Surprisingly, you do not 
have to copy the ../ISO8859-2/Compose file to ../ISO8859-1 directory 
and dead keys work nicely.</P

>These distributions work well as they should. In KDE, you must open the
menu: Start &#62; Preferences &#62; Personalization  &#62; Country and Language,
where you will change CHARSET from ISO8859-1 to ISO8859-2 (or ISO8859-X for
any other language of your choice). Then you may either select a keyboard 
layout - Peripherals, Keyboard (Slovak is included with dozens of other 
keyboard XKB maps) from the menu: Start &#62; Configuration &#62; KDE &#62;  
Personalisation &#62; Peripherals &#62; Keyboard, or you may choose my Standard 
Xmodmap solution. No other files require editing. That's great! Alternatively, 
you can set your keyboard with setxkbmap command (see section FreeBSD 4.4). </P

>The legacy solution must be used here. No LANG=language statement is necessary 
in your bash_profile. Here the "experimental" .Xmodmap solution works 
("mu" instead of "lcaron", etc.) and you must copy the Compose file from 
../IS08859-2 to ISO8859-1 directory in order for dead keys to work. There is 
only one XF86Config file in /etc/X11 and its FontPath must contain path to
the pertinent fonts.</P

>6.6. RedHat 7.2, RedHat 8.0, Slackware 8.1</H2
><P
>RedHat 7.2 behaves same as Mandrake 8.1. RedHat 8.0, with KDE 3, works nicely
without problems - you can use the xmodmap solution immediately without digging 
up in the system and changing configurations. You do not have to go to Look and
Feel menu in the Preferences menu - you can either apply the xmodmap solution 
immediately, or you can choose to configure (add) keyboard in the Preferences -
Peripherals menu (if you decide for XKB). You will have the keyboard icon 
placed on the panel and you just click on it to switch between keyboards.
Slackware 8.1 behaves exactly as RedHat 8.0, I only had to include the "export=
language command (both for XKB and Xmodmap solution) in the Bash profile for 
the dead keys to work.</P

>FreeBSD 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 does not use Slovak locale, so we must use
the Czech one here. It really does not matter. Here this depends on XFree86. 
Because the FreeBSD guys are too conservative about newer versions, 
they ship FreeBSD with older versions of XFree86. In FreeBSD 4.1 the 
experimental .Xmodmap solution works and you have to copy the 
../ISO8859-2/Compose file to ../ISO8859-1 directory to make the dead keys work.</P
