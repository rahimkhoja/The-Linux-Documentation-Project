<P>This document was born trying to learn more about writing texts on my
linux system.
The one system looking like suitable to my needs was sgml-tools
<A HREF="http://www.sgml-tools.org">SGML-Tools Organsation</A> an the
linuxdoc dtd.
<P>In [<EM>SGML-Tools User's Guide 1.0 ($Revision: 1.1.1.1 $)</EM>] (see section
<A HREF="Linuxdoc-Reference-13.html#reference">Reference</A>) the overall structure is described
nice and easy.
Also [<EM>Quick SGML Example, v1.0</EM>] (see section 
<A HREF="Linuxdoc-Reference-13.html#reference">Reference</A>) was helpful, <B>but</B>:
<P>A lot of features are not mentioned.
<P>On the way to learn more about it, I met [<EM>The qwertz Document Type
Definition</EM>] (see section 
<A HREF="Linuxdoc-Reference-13.html#reference">Reference</A>).
It's as detailed as hoped, but it's not made for the linuxdoc dtd
<!--
dtd
-->
 (even if linuxdoc is based on qwertz).
<P>I tried a new approach:
Look at the dtd
<BLOCKQUOTE>dtd = document type definition</BLOCKQUOTE>

file itself, and try to understand it.
<P>As time went by I noticed that I also forgot about some stuff,
or - at least - didn't point it out strong enough.
This will change within the next revision.
<P>Any feedback you might have is welcome (especially help with English
spelling or grammar) by e-mail at
