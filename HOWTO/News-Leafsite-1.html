<P>In normal cases if you want to read news offline on your local computer
you have to install a news server software like INN or CNews. Also you
are in the need for an nntp or uucp connection to your newsfeed.  In
fact that such packages contain much more features than you need, you
run better by installing Leafnode.
<P>
<P>Leafnode is much simpler to use and very small but there are some
disadvantages: Leafnode is slow and loses news in about any error
situation. That's why you shouldn't use it for a big news server,
nevertheless, it´s appropriate for private users who don´t want spend
much time configuring INN.
