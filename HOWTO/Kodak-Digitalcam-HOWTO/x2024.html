>   OpenDiS contains a user-level program and an access library for using DigitaOS enabled cameras. Currently those cameras would be the Kodak DC220, DC260, DC265, DC290 and HP Photosmart C500 and the Minolta EX1500. Although the Kodak digital camera series works best with this application the others have been found to work with the application also. This program has a CLI (command line interface) which is very useful for scripting tasks.

Updated: 0.0.3 
Development note: currently some COMMANDs are supported; default 
action is to display this help.  However, all listed 
OPTIONS are now supported. 
 
-d DEV, --device=DEV       Look for camera at device DEV.  Defaults 
                            to /dev/ttyS0. 
 -r RATE, --rate=RATE       Use bit-rate RATE for serial device.  Defaults 
                            to 9600.  Not applicable to USB or IrDA. 
 -t TYPE, --type=TYPE       Specifies device type, one of: "serial" 
                            "usb", or "irda".  Normally, device type 
                            can be deduced from DEV and need not be 
                            specified 
 -i, --irda                 Same as --type=irda 
 -s, --serial               Same as --type=serial 
 -u, --usb                  Same as --type=usb 
 
 -v  --verbose              More output. 
 -q  --quiet                Less output. 
 
 -l, --list                 List supported commands 
 -h, --help                 Display this help and exit.

Currently following commands are supported: 

  delall        Delete all files in the camera 
  download      Download pictures 
  thumbs        Download thumbnails 
  gettime       Get camera's date/time 
  settime       Set camera clock according to computer's clock 
  shoot         Take a picture 
  status        Show pictures taken, available and raw count 
  getpowermode  Checks if camera is on 
  poweroff      Turn the camera off

>    USB:  
   </P
><P
>    Special USB notes. The USB stack has been ever changing in the developmental kernels and as such works differently from time to time. In playing with the latest developmental kernel released the camera tends to show up on /dev/dc2xx0 or /dev/dc2xx1, independent of the fact that only one camera is connected. The support for these devices is all fairly new, so expect to have to play with it to get it working. The following should allow one to download all images from the camera to the working directory with a USB connection. Make sure that the camera is in connect mode.

The options are endless when it comes to scripts like this.

>   Still deciding the best way to implement this section. Possibly a DocBook manual for gPhoto needs to be written but according to the gPhoto project web site a manual is being developed at the moment. Contact with the developers of gPhoto has been made and a decision to work on the document at some point, presuming someone else doesn't do it earlier, has been made. However the document processing program used to create this HOWTO, LyX, does not support all the necessary SGML tags and thus that will become an intermediate project before a manual for gPhoto.
  </P
><P
>   A manual is available for gPhoto with its source code and may also be distributed with the various package offerings available with gPhoto binary distributions. The filename is MANUAL and it is located in the root of the extracted tar archive. The file INSTALL details the process of compiling and installing gPhoto if a binary package is not available for a particular distribution.

With the CVS version of the software USB support is added for the DC220, DC260, DC265 and the DC280. gPhoto tends to be the preferred application of most digital camera users under GNU/Linux and is distributed with <A
