>    The linux-kernel mailing list is a very high traffic mailing list detailing all aspects of the Linux kernel. This list is only for those who wish to have more information than the Linux-USB list and the gPhoto-Kodak lists contain. However, it covers much more of a broad spectrum of topics than Kodak digital camera support under Linux.

   </P

>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A
> with "subscribe linux-kernel username@mailserver" in the body of the message where username is the email account to be used and mailserver is the name of the mail server. Remember to omit the quotation marks. 
   </P
><P
>    An alternative to joining the list would be to get the list in digest format. This is a better format to many as it is a few emails a day rather than several hundred. One drawback of this is that it is not as easy to discuss the issues with the mailing list as most mail clients don't know how to deal with the digest in its format besides dealing with it like plain text. To subscribe to the digest send an email to <A
HREF="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu"
TARGET="_top"
>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A
> with the line "subscribe linux-kernel-digest username@mailserver" in the body of the message. Where username is the email account username to be used and mailserver is the name of the mail server. Remember to omit the quotation marks.

TARGET="_top"
>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A
> with the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in the body of the message, or alternately "unsubscribe linux-kernel-digest" if subscribed to the digest. And again, remember to omit the quotation marks.

Chances are one of the later developmental kernels or the source on the CVS will solve the issue.
