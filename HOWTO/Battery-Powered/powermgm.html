><P
>If you have a relatively recent x86 laptop, odds are it supports either
Advanced Power Management (APM) or Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
(ACPI). ACPI is the newer of the two technologies and puts power management in
the hands of the operating system, allowing for more intelligent power
management than is possible with BIOS controlled APM. This is most useful for 
battery-powered laptops. 
You can only have one
power management interface in control of your machine at a time, so it's
important you decide which method best suits your situation.</P

allows your computer's BIOS to control your system's power management
without the knowledge of the operating system.
The advantages to APM under Linux are that it's stable, well supported by 
Linux vendors and has a solid history behind it. 
However, not much development has been done with it over the past few 
years.</P

is the successor to APM, which places the responsibility of power management
away from the BIOS and into the hands of the operating system.
ACPI Linux is newer than APM Linux, more flexible in responding to power 
management events, has seen
much more development as of late, and as a result of all this is prone to its 
own share of bugs from
time to time.</P

kernel
builds and applying patches against source code, ACPI is worth

>There are two parts to ACPI under Linux:  The ACPI driver built into the
kernel itself, and the ACPI daemon (ACPID).  ACPID in its current incarnation 
is
pretty simple:  monitor /proc/acpi/event and do things in response.  Even if
you don't load the daemon, you'll still get the benefit of ACPI features built
into the kernel such as processor thermal support.</P

>A bit of history... Microsoft was the first vendor to implement ACPI.  
This is both good and
bad.  It is good because when you buy a system, you can pretty much guarantee
that it has passed Microsoft's hardware compliance tests, including the test
of its ACPI implementation.  However, these tests come up short in that they
do not indicate compliance with the ACPI specification, but rather with
Microsoft's implementation of ACPI.  When that same machine is used with
Linux, some classes of errors that did not manifest themselves under Windows
may become apparent.  To protect against this problem, the Linux ACPI driver 
maintains a "bad BIOS" blacklist of known BIOS's that are known to not be ACPI
compliant, and as a result will refuse to enable ACPI if your system is 
listed.</P
><P
>Many manufacturers are now validating that their systems run on Linux.
However, they use major Linux distributions with the default kernel.  This
means that it is somewhat difficult to get OEMs to ensure that their systems
work with ACPI-enabled Linux until a major Linux distribution ships an ACPI
kernel.  This presents a slight dilemma in that Linux distributions want to
ship kernels that run on as many systems as possible, but there have been some
positive moves in this area lately.</P
><P
>To conserve energy while remaining quickly available, ACPI-compatible 
PCs may enter system sleep states. The ACPI specification defines five of 
these states, known as S-states. Unlike processor sleep states, no work is 
done by the system under S-states. Each state introduces greater power savings 
but requires commensurately more time to awaken and begin performing work. 
These are patterned on system states from the APM standard, a predecessor of 
ACPI.</P

>1.3. APM vs. ACPI: Which one?</H2
><P
>There are currently two competing standards for providing power 
management: APM and ACPI.  Both cannot be used at the same time, so which one 
is best for your situation?  If you have a relatively recent (&#62;2.4.20) kernel 
and are not intimidated by kernel builds and patching source code, you'll find 
many benefits with the flexibility of ACPI.  If you just want to enable 
generic power management, or are using an older machine, choose APM.  Neither 
method spins down idle hard drives; use hdparm for that instead.  Either way, 
your system's BIOS must correctly support the power management scheme you'd 
like to use as well; if your system does not fully support either standard, 
some of the power management options might crash your system and/or cause data 
loss.  You have been warned!</P
><P
>Even if you don't enable power management on your x86-laptop, Linux will 
always issue the HLT instruction to your 
processor whenever nothing needs to be done 

<A

CLASS="footnote"

>.  

Many Microsoft Windows CPU cooling program use this technique.  This results 
in lowering the power consumption  of your CPU.  Note that the system doesn't 
power down when it receives the HLT instruction; it just stops executing 
instructions until there is an interrupt.</P

enabling either type of power management on servers or workstations that do 
not fall into
these categories.</P
