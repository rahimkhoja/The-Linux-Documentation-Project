<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A> </H2>

<P>This page contains a simple cookbook for setting up Red Hat 6.X as an internet
gateway for a home network or small office network. The instructions are very
simplified: no special cases will be discussed, and some assumptions will be
made about which network addresses are to be used. The most important assumptions
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You have a fulltime Cable or ADSL connection to the Internet. </LI>
<LI>You can successfully install 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat 6.X</A> on at least one of your computers. Note that
these directions are also valid for Red Hat derivatives, such as 
<A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com">Mandrake 6.X</A> which is
distributed by MacMillan Publishing under a variety of labels. </LI>
<LI>Your Linux computer has two network cards installed in it and both are
compatible with Linux. </LI>
<LI>You have an ethernet hub if you are networking more than one computer or
a cross-over cable if you are only networking one computer. </LI>
<LI>You know how to edit text files on your Linux machine. </LI>
<LI>You can log into your machine as <CODE>root</CODE>. You know how to install RPM packages
from your Linux CDROM. </LI>
</UL>
<P>If you do not meet any of these assumptions, then this document probably
isn't for you.
<P>There is nothing special that you have to do during the installation process.
Simply choose an installation which makes sense for you and go for it. This
document gives directions on installing everything to do with networking from
scratch, to avoid making any assumptions about what was installed or configured
during installation. To ensure that things work and there is no confusion about
what information goes where, all the configuration will be done by directly
editing the system configuration files rather than using the GUI configuration
tools provided with Red Hat. On the one hand, this might be a little harder
than it has to be; on the other hand, your knowledge will be a good deal more
transferable to different distributions and situations (like, what if X doesn't
work, or you are setting up a headless server).
