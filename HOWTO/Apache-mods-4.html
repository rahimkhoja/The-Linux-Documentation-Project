<P>Much of this information can be obtained by reading the README and INSTALL files
included with the various modules.  However, this document is useful in the
cases which didn't work as expected for me, or else for which the installation
procedure was not as well defined as I would have liked.  It also has the added
benefit of being one, sequential document, which should hopefully be easier to
follow and understand than a slew of README files.

Phillip R. Wilson &lt;pwilson@drew.edu>, author of mod_auth_nds, for helping me get
 mod_auth_nds to compile and install with apxs.

John Ash &lt;jash@wwc.edu>, my boss, for all sorts of help and of course, a job.

Marcus Faure &lt;marcus@faure.de>, author of the Apache SSL PHP/FI frontpage mini-
 HOWTO, whose document this one is loosely based on.

<P>Everything mentioned in this document will eventually be available for ftp
from ftp.wwc.edu/pub/apache.  I will have everything laid out as described
above, and hopefully installation scripts to install everything from scratch.
(A very dumb script mind you).
