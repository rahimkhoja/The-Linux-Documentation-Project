<P>
<P>The following lists many cards in alphabetical order by vendor
name and then product identifier. Beside each product ID, you
will see either `Supported', `Semi-Supported', `Obsolete',
`Dropped' or `Not Supported'.
<P>Supported means that a driver for that card exists, and many
people are happily using it and it seems quite reliable.
<P>Semi-Supported means that a driver exists, but at least one
of the following descriptions is true:
(1) The driver and/or hardware are buggy, which may cause poor
performance, failing connections or even crashes.
(2) The driver is new or the card is fairly uncommon,
and hence the driver has
seen very little use/testing and the driver author has had
very little feedback. Obviously (2) is preferable to (1), and
the individual description of the card/driver should make it
clear which one holds true. In either case, you will probably have
to answer `Y' when asked ``Prompt for development and/or
incomplete code/drivers?'' when running <CODE>make config</CODE>.
<P>Obsolete means that a driver exists, and was probably at
one time considered Semi-Supported. However, due to lack of
interest, users, and support, it is known to not work anymore.
The driver is still in the kernel, but disabled in the 
configuration option menu.  The general plan is that if it
does not get updated by the next kernel development cycle,
it will be dropped entirely.  Usually a driver marked obsolete
simply needs an update to match changes in the kernel to 
driver interface, or other similar kernel API changes.
<P>Dropped means that the driver was once obsolete (see above)
and since there was not enough interest in fixing it, it
has been removed from the current kernel tree.  There is
nothing stopping anyone from copying the driver from an
older kernel, making the required updates and using it.
<P>Not Supported means there is not a driver currently available
for that card. This could be due to a lack of interest in
hardware that is rare/uncommon, or because the vendors won't
release the hardware documentation required to write a driver.
<P>Note that the difference between `Supported' and `Semi-Supported'
is rather subjective, and is based on user feedback.
So be warned that you may find
a card listed as semi-supported works perfectly for you (which
is great), or that a card listed as supported gives you no end
of troubles and problems (which is not so great).
<P>After the status, the name of the driver given in the linux kernel
is listed. This will also be the name of the driver module that
would be used in the <CODE>alias eth0 driver_name</CODE> line that is
found in the <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> module configuration file.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="3com"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 3Com</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you are not sure what your card is, but you think it is a
3Com card, you can probably figure it out from the assembly
number. 3Com has a document `Identifying 3Com Adapters By
Assembly Number' (ref 24500002) that would most likely clear
things up.  Also check out their WWW/FTP site with various goodies:
<CODE>www.3Com.com</CODE> that you may find useful (including PDFs
with technical info for their cards).
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c501"></A> 3c501</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c501
<P>This obsolete stone-age 8 bit card is really
too brain-damaged to use. Avoid it like the plague. Do not
purchase this card, even as a joke. It's performance
is horrible, and it breaks in many ways.
<P>For those not yet convinced, the 3c501 can only do one
thing at a time -- while you are removing one packet
from the single-packet buffer it cannot receive
another packet, nor can it receive a packet while
loading a transmit packet. This was fine for a
network between two 8088-based computers where
processing each packet and replying took 10's of
msecs, but modern networks send back-to-back
packets for almost every transaction.
<P>AutoIRQ works, DMA isn't used, the autoprobe only
looks at <CODE>0x280</CODE> and <CODE>0x300</CODE>, and the debug level is set
with the third boot-time argument.
<P>Once again, the use of a 3c501 is <EM>strongly discouraged</EM>!
Even more so with a IP multicast kernel, as you will
grind to a halt while listening to <EM>all</EM> multicast
packets. See the comments at the top of the source code
for more details.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c503"></A> EtherLink II, 3c503, 3c503/16</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c503 (+8390)
<P>The 3c503 does not have ``EEPROM setup'',
so a diagnostic/setup program
isn't needed before running the card with Linux. The
shared memory address of the 3c503 is set using jumpers
that are shared with the boot PROM address. This is
confusing to people familiar with other ISA cards,
where you always leave the jumper set to ``disable''
unless you have a boot PROM.
<P>These cards should be about the same speed as the same bus
width WD80x3, but turn out to be actually a bit slower.
These shared-memory ethercards also have a
programmed I/O mode that doesn't use the 8390
facilities (their engineers found too many bugs!)
The Linux 3c503 driver can also work with the 3c503
in programmed-I/O mode, but this is slower and less
reliable than shared memory mode. Also, programmed-I/O
mode is not as well tested when updating the drivers.
You shouldn't use the programmed-I/O mode
unless you need it for compatibility with another
operating system that is used on the same computer.
<P>The 3c503's IRQ line is set in software, with no hints
from an EEPROM. Unlike the MS-DOS drivers, the
Linux driver has capability to autoIRQ: it uses the
first available IRQ line in {5,2/9,3,4}, selected each
time the card is ifconfig'ed.  Note that `ifconfig' will 
return EAGAIN if no IRQ line is available at that time.
<P>Some common problems that people have with the 503
are discussed in 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-2.html#3com-probs">Problems with...</A>.
<P>If you intend on using this driver as a loadable module
you should probably see
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-8.html#modules">Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A>
for module specific information.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c505"></A> Etherlink Plus 3c505</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c505
<P>These cards use the i82586 chip but are not that many of them about.
It is included in the standard kernel, but it is classed as
an alpha driver. See 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-2.html#alfa">Alpha Drivers</A>
for important information on using alpha-test ethernet drivers
with Linux.
<P>There is also the file
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/README.3c505</CODE>
that you should read if you are going to use one of these cards.
It contains various options that you can enable/disable.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c507"></A> Etherlink-16 3c507</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c507
<P>This card uses one of the Intel chips, and the
development of the driver is closely related to
the development of the Intel Ether Express driver.
The driver is included in the standard kernel
release, but as an alpha driver.
See 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-2.html#alfa">Alpha Drivers</A> for important
information on using alpha-test ethernet drivers
with Linux. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c509"></A> Etherlink III, 3c509 / 3c509B</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c509
<P>This card was fairly inexpensive and had
good performance for an ISA non-bus-master design.
The drawbacks were that the original 3c509
required very low interrupt latency. The 3c509B
shouldn't suffer from the same problem, due to
having a larger buffer. (See below.) These cards
use PIO transfers, similar to a ne2000 card, and so
a shared memory card such as a wd8013 will be more
efficient in comparison.
<P>The original 3c509 had a small packet buffer
(4kB total, 2kB Rx, 2kB Tx), causing the driver to
occasionally drop a packet if interrupts were masked for
too long. To minimize this problem, you can try unmasking
interrupts during IDE disk transfers (see <CODE>man hdparm</CODE>) and/or
increasing your ISA bus speed so IDE transfers finish sooner.
<P>The newer model 3c509B has 8kB on board, and the buffer
can be split 4/4, 5/3 or 6/2 for Rx/Tx. This setting
is changed with the DOS configuration utility, and is stored
on the EEPROM. This should alleviate the
above problem with the original 3c509.
<P>3c509B users should use either the supplied DOS
utility to disable the <EM>plug and play</EM> support, <EM>and</EM>
to set the output media to what they require. The linux
driver currently does <EM>not</EM> support the Autodetect
media setting, so you <EM>have</EM> to select 10Base-T or
10Base-2 or AUI.
Note that if you turn off PnP entirely, you should exit the
utility and  and then follow that with a hard
reset to ensure that the new settings take effect.
<P>Some people ask about the ``Server or Workstation'' and ``Highest
Modem Speed'' settings presented in the DOS configuration utility.
These settings don't actually change any hardware settings, rather
they are only tuning hints to the DOS driver.  The linux driver
does not need or use these hints.   Also, DON'T enable EISA mode
on this ISA card unless you really have an EISA machine, or 
you may end up needing to find an EISA machine just to get
your ISA card back into ISA mode!
<P>The card with the lowest hardware ethernet address
will <EM>always</EM> end up being <CODE>eth0</CODE> in a multiple ISA 
3c509 configuration.  This shouldn't matter
to anyone, except for those people who want to assign
a 6 byte hardware address to a particular interface.
If this really bothers you, have a look at Donald's latest driver,
as you may be able to use a <CODE>0x3c509</CODE> value in the unused mem
address fields to order the detection to suit your needs.

<H3><A NAME="cork"></A> 3c515</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c515
<P>This is 3Com's ISA 100Mbps offering, codenamed ``CorkScrew''. 
Note that you will never achieve full 100Mbps on an ISA bus.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c523"></A> 3c523</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c523
<P>This MCA bus card uses the i82586, and  Chris Beauregard
has modified the ni52 driver to work with these cards.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c527"></A> 3c527 Etherlink MC/32</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c527
<P>Yes, another i82586 MCA card. No, not too much interest in it.
Better chances with the 3c529 if you are stuck with MCA,
since it uses the tried and true 3c509 core.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c529"></A> 3c529</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c509
<P>This card actually uses the same chipset as the 3c509.
People have actually been using this card in MCA machines.

<H3>3c556</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x
<P>A mini PCI NIC found on various IBM and HP notebooks.
Also knownas a `laptop tornado'.
<P>
<H3>3c562</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c589_cs
<P>This PCMCIA card is the combination of a 3c589B ethernet card
with a modem. The modem appears as a standard modem to the
end user. The only difficulty is getting the two separate
linux drivers to share one interrupt. There are a couple of new
registers and some hardware interrupt sharing support.
Thanks again to Cameron for getting a sample unit and
documentation sent off to David Hinds.
<P>
<H3>3c575</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x
<P>Note that to support this Cardbus device in old 2.2 kernels,
you had to use 3c575_cb.c from the pcmcia_cs package.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c579"></A> 3c579</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c509
<P>The EISA version of the 509. The current EISA version
uses the same 16 bit wide chip rather than a 32 bit
interface, so the performance increase isn't stunning.
Make sure the card is configured for EISA addressing mode.
Read the above 3c509 section for info on the driver.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="3c589"></A> 3c589 / 3c589B</H3>

<P>Status: Semi-Supported, Driver Name: 3c589_cs
<P>Many people have been using this PCMCIA card for quite some time     
now.  The "B" in the name means the same here as it does for
the 3c509 case.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="vortex"></A> 3c590 / 3c595</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x
<P>These ``Vortex'' cards are for PCI bus machines, with the '590
being 10Mbps and the '595 being 3Com's 100Mbs offering.
Also note that you can run the '595 as a '590 (i.e. in a 10Mbps mode).
The 3c59x line was replaced by the 3c9xx line quite some time ago,
and so these cards are considered rather old.
<P>Note that there are two different 3c590 cards out there, early
models that had 32kB of on-board memory, and later models that
only have 8kB of memory.  The 3c595 cards have 64kB,
as you can't get away with only 8kB RAM at 100Mbps!
<P>
<H3>3c592 / 3c597</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x
<P>These are  the EISA versions of the 3c59x
series of cards. The 3c592/3c597 (aka Demon) should work with
the vortex driver discussed above.
<P>
<H3>3c900 / 3c905 / 3c905B / 3c905C / 3c905CX</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: 3c59x
<P>These cards (aka `Boomerang', aka EtherLink III XL) have been
released to take over the place of the 3c590/3c595 cards,
with some additional support added to the vortex/3c59x driver.
The driver found in older kernels may not support the latest
revision(s) of these cards, so you may need a driver update.
<P>Note that the 3c905C has support for TCP/UDP/IP checksumming
in hardware support - meaning less work for the computer
CPU to do!
<P>
<H3>3c985 (Gigabit acenic, aka Tigon2)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: acenic
<P>This driver supports several other Gigabit cards in 
addition to the 3Com model.
<P>
<H3>3c996 (Gigabit broadcom, aka Tigon3)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: tg3, bcm5700(old)
<P>This driver supports several other Gigabit cards in 
addition to the 3Com model.  The <CODE>tg3</CODE> driver is a 
complete rewrite by several linux developers in an effort
to improve on the vendor supplied <CODE>bcm5700</CODE> driver.

<P>
<H3>Accton EN1203, EN1207, EtherDuo-PCI</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: de4x5, tulip, OR 8139too
<P>Apparently there have been several revisions of the
EN1207 (A through D) with A, B, and C being tulip based
and the D revision being RealTek 8139 based (different driver).
So as with all purchases, you should try and make sure
you can return it if it doesn't work for you.

<H3><A NAME="at-1500"></A> AT1500</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: lance
<P>These are a series of low-cost ethercards using the 79C960 version
of the AMD LANCE. These are bus-master cards, and hence one of
the faster ISA bus ethercards available.
<P>DMA selection and chip numbering information can be found in
<A HREF="#lance">AMD LANCE</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="at1700"></A> AT1700</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: at1700
<P>Note that to access this driver during <CODE>make config</CODE>
you still have to answer `Y' when asked ``Prompt for
development and/or incomplete code/drivers?'' at
the first. This is simply due to lack of feedback on the
driver stability due to it being a relatively rare card.
If you have problems with the driver that ships with
the kernel then you may be interested in the alternative 
driver available at:
<CODE>http://www.cc.hit-u.ac.jp/nagoya/at1700/</CODE>
<P>The Allied Telesis AT1700 series ethercards are based
on the Fujitsu MB86965. This chip uses a programmed
I/O interface, and a pair of fixed-size transmit
buffers. This allows small groups of packets to
be sent back-to-back, with a short pause while
switching buffers.
<P>The Fujitsu chip used on the AT1700 has a design flaw:
it can only be fully reset by doing a power cycle of the machine.
Pressing the reset button doesn't reset the bus interface. This
wouldn't be so bad, except that it can only be reliably detected
when it has been freshly reset. The solution/work-around is to
power-cycle the machine if the kernel has a problem detecting
the AT1700.

<H2><A NAME="amd"></A> <A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 AMD / Advanced Micro Devices</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Carl Ching of AMD was kind enough to provide a very
detailed description of all the relevant AMD ethernet
products which helped clear up this section.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="lance"></A> AMD LANCE (7990, 79C960/961/961A, PCnet-ISA)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: lance
<P>There really is no AMD ethernet card. You are probably reading this
because the only markings you could find on your card said AMD
and the above number. The 7990 is the original `LANCE' chip,
but most stuff (including this document) refer to all these
similar chips as `LANCE' chips. (...incorrectly, I might add.)
<P>These above numbers refer to chips from AMD
that are the heart of many ethernet cards.
For example, the Allied Telesis AT1500 (see
<A HREF="#at-1500">AT1500</A>) and the NE1500/2100 (see
<A HREF="#ne1500">NE1500</A>)  use these chips.
<P>The 7990/79c90 have long been replaced by newer versions.
The 79C960 (a.k.a. PCnet-ISA) essentially contains the 79c90
core, along with all the other hardware support required, which
allows a single-chip ethernet solution. The 79c961 (PCnet-ISA+)
is a jumperless Plug and Play version of the '960. The final
chip in the ISA series is the 79c961A (PCnet-ISA II), which
adds full duplex capabilities.
All cards with one of these chips should work with
the lance.c driver, with the exception of very old cards that
used the original 7990 in a shared memory configuration. These
old cards can be spotted by the lack of jumpers for a DMA channel.
<P>One common problem people have is the `busmaster arbitration
failure' message. This is printed out when the LANCE driver
can't get access to the bus after a reasonable amount of time
has elapsed (50us). This usually indicates that the motherboard
implementation of bus-mastering DMA is broken, or some other device
is hogging the bus, or there is a DMA channel conflict. If your BIOS
setup has the `GAT option' (for Guaranteed Access Time) then try
toggling/altering that setting to see if it helps.
<P>Also note that the driver only looks at the addresses:
<CODE>0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360</CODE> for a valid card, and any
address supplied by an <CODE>ether=</CODE> boot argument is silently
ignored (this will be fixed) so make sure your card is configured
for one of the above I/O addresses for now.
<P>The driver will still work fine, even
if more than 16MB of memory is installed, since low-memory
`bounce-buffers' are used when needed (i.e. any data from
above 16MB is copied into a buffer below 16MB before being
given to the card to transmit.)
<P>The DMA channel can be set with the low bits
of the otherwise-unused dev->mem_start value (a.k.a. PARAM_1).
(see 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-8.html#ether">PARAM_1</A>)
If unset it is probed for by enabling each free DMA channel
in turn and checking if initialization succeeds.
<P>The HP-J2405A board is an exception: with this board it's easy
to read the EEPROM-set values for the IRQ, and DMA.
<P>
<H3>AMD 79C901 (Home PNA PHY)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: sis900
<P>The <CODE>sis900.txt</CODE> file in 2.4 kernels states that 
"AM79C901 HomePNA PHY is not thoroughly tested, there may 
be some bugs in the "on the fly" change of transceiver."
so you may want to check that if using a newer kernel.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="pcnet-32"></A> AMD 79C965 (PCnet-32)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: pcnet32
<P>This is the PCnet-32 -- a 32 bit bus-master version of the
original LANCE chip for VL-bus and local bus systems.
chip.  While these chips can be operated with the standard
<CODE>lance.c</CODE> driver, a 32 bit version (<CODE>pcnet32.c</CODE>) is
also available that does not have to concern itself with
any 16MB limitations associated with the ISA bus.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="pcnet-pci"></A> AMD 79C970/970A (PCnet-PCI)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: pcnet32
<P>This is the PCnet-PCI -- similar to the PCnet-32, but designed
for PCI bus based systems. Please see the
above PCnet-32 information.
This means that you need to build a kernel with
PCI BIOS support enabled. The '970A adds full duplex support
along with some other features to the original '970 design.
<P>Note that the Boca implementation of the 79C970 fails on
fast Pentium machines. This is a hardware problem, as it
affects DOS users as well. See the Boca section for more
details.
<P>
<H3>AMD 79C971 (PCnet-FAST)</H3>

<P>This EISA bus card is based on the common 8390
chip used in the ne2000 and wd80x3 cards.
Note that to access this driver during <CODE>make config</CODE>
you still have to answer `Y' when asked ``Prompt for
development and/or incomplete code/drivers?'' at
the first. This is simply due to lack of feedback on the
driver stability due to it being a relatively rare card.
Feedback has been low even though the driver has
been in the kernel since v1.1.25.

<P>This on board ethernet uses an i82596 bus-master chip.
It can only be at I/O address <CODE>0x300</CODE>.
By looking at the driver source,
it appears that the IRQ is also hardwired to 10.

<P>With the very low cost and better performance of ethernet,
chances are that most places will be giving away their Arcnet
hardware for free, resulting in a lot of home systems with Arcnet.
<P>An advantage of Arcnet is that all of the cards have identical
interfaces, so one driver will work for everyone. It also has
built in error handling so that it supposedly never loses a packet.
(Great for UDP traffic!) Note that the arcnet driver
uses `arc0' as its name instead of the usual `eth0' for
ethernet devices.
<P>There are information files contained in the standard kernel for
setting jumpers, general hints and where to mail bug reports.

as well!

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: lance, pcnet32
<P>These cards are based on AMD's PCnet chips.
Many people reported endless problems with these VLB/PCI cards. 
The problem was supposedly due to Boca not installing 
some capacitors that AMD recommended.
(The older ISA cards don't appear to suffer the same problems.)
Boca was offering a `warranty repair' for
affected owners, which involved adding one of the missing
capacitors, but it appears that this fix didn't work 100
percent for most people, although it helped some.  The
cards are so old now that it wouldn't be worth pursuing.

<P>The E2100 is a poor design. Whenever it maps its
shared memory in during a packet transfer, it
maps it into the <EM>whole 128K region!</EM> That means you
<B>can't</B> safely use another interrupt-driven shared
memory device in that region, including another E2100.
It will work most of the time, but every once in
a while it will bite you. (Yes, this problem can
be avoided by turning off interrupts while
transferring packets, but that will almost certainly
lose clock ticks.) Also, if you mis-program the board,
or halt the machine at just the wrong moment, even
the reset button won't bring it back. You will <EM>have</EM>
to turn it off and <EM>leave</EM> it off for about 30 seconds.
<P>Media selection is automatic, but you can override this
with the low bits of the dev-&gt;mem_end parameter.
See 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-8.html#ether">PARAM_2</A>. Module users
can specify an <CODE>xcvr=N</CODE> value as an <CODE>option</CODE> in
the <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> file.
<P>Also, don't confuse the E2100 for a NE2100 clone.
The E2100 is a shared memory NatSemi DP8390 design,
roughly similar to a brain-damaged WD8013, whereas
the NE2100 (and NE1500) use a bus-mastering AMD
LANCE design.

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: pcnet32
<P>Machines such as the XL series have an AMD 79c97x PCI chip
on the mainboard that can be used with the standard LANCE
driver. But before you can use it, you have to do some
trickery to get the PCI BIOS to a place where Linux can
see it. Frank Maas was kind enough to provide the
details:
<P>`` The problem with this Compaq machine however is that the PCI
directory is loaded in high memory, at a spot where the Linux
kernel can't (won't) reach. Result: the card is never detected nor
is it usable (sideline: the mouse won't work either)
The workaround (as described thoroughly in
http://www-c724.uibk.ac.at/XL/)
is to load MS-DOS, launch a little driver Compaq wrote and then
load the Linux kernel using LOADLIN. Ok, I'll give you time to
say `yuck, yuck', but for now this is the only working solution
I know of. The little driver simply moves the PCI directory to
a place where it is normally stored (and where Linux can find it).''

identical between the 2kB and 32kB mode. There is more information
(including using the driver as a loadable module) at the top
of the driver file <CODE>ewrk3.c</CODE> and also in <CODE>README.ewrk3</CODE>.
Both of these files come with the standard kernel distribution.
This driver has Alpha CPU support like depca.c does.

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: de4x5, tulip
<P>The DEC 21040 is a bus-mastering single chip ethernet solution
from Digital, similar to AMD's PCnet chip. The 21040 is
specifically designed for the PCI bus architecture.
Apparently these chips are no longer being produced, as Intel

generic 21040  `tulip' driver.
<P><B>Warning:</B> Even though your card may be based upon this chip,
<EM>the drivers may not work for you</EM>. David C. Davies writes:
<P>``There are no guarantees that either `tulip.c' OR `de4x5.c'
will run any DC2114x based card other than those they've been
written to support.  WHY?? You ask.  Because there is a register,
the General Purpose Register (CSR12) that (1) in the DC21140A is
programmable by each vendor and they all do it differently
(2) in the DC21142/3 this is now an SIA control register
(a la DC21041). The only small ray of hope is that we can decode the
SROM to help set up the driver. However, this is not a guaranteed
solution since some vendors (e.g. SMC 9332 card) don't follow the
Digital Semiconductor recommended SROM programming format."
<P>In non-technical terms, this means that if you aren't sure that an
unknown card with a DC2114x chip will work with the linux driver(s),
then make sure you can return the card to the place of
purchase <EM>before</EM> you pay for it.
<P>The 21041 chip is also found in place of the 21040
on most of the later SMC EtherPower cards.
The 21140 is for supporting 100Base-T and

<H3><A NAME="ne2k"></A> NE1000, NE2000</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: ne (+8390)
<P>The ne2000 is now a generic name for a bare-bones design around
the NatSemi 8390 chip. They use programmed I/O rather than
shared memory, leading to easier installation but
slightly lower performance and a few problems. 
Some of the more common problems that arise
with NE2000 cards are listed in 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-2.html#ne2k-probs">Problems with...</A><P>Some NE2000 clones use the National
Semiconductor `AT/LANTic' 83905 chip, which offers
a shared memory mode similar to the wd8013 and EEPROM
software configuration. The shared memory mode will offer
less CPU usage (i.e. more efficient) than the programmed
I/O mode.
<P>In general it is not a good idea to put a NE2000
clone at I/O address <CODE>0x300</CODE> because nearly
<EM>every</EM> device driver probes there at boot. Some
poor NE2000 clones don't take kindly to being prodded
in the wrong areas, and will respond by locking your
machine. Also <CODE>0x320</CODE> is bad because SCSI drivers
probe into <CODE>0x330</CODE>.
<P>Donald has written a NE2000 diagnostic program (ne2k.c)
for all ne2000 cards.
See 
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO-6.html#diag">Diagnostic Programs</A> for more
information.

<H3><A NAME="ne2k-pci"></A> NE2000-PCI (RealTek/Winbond/Compex)</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: ne, ne2k-pci (+8390)
<P>Yes, believe it or not, people are making PCI cards based on
the more than ten year old interface 
design of the ne2000. At the moment
nearly all of these cards are based on the RealTek 8029 chip,
or the Winbond 89c940 chip. The Compex, KTI, VIA and Netvin cards
apparently also use these chips, but have a different PCI ID.
<P>The latest v2.0 kernel has support to automatically detect all
these cards and use them. (If you are using a kernel v2.0.34 or
older, you should upgrade to ensure your card will be detected.)
There are now two drivers to choose from; the original ISA/PCI
<CODE>ne.c</CODE> driver, and a relatively new PCI-only <CODE>ne2k-pci.c</CODE>
driver.
<P>To use the original ISA/PCI driver you have to say `Y'  to
the `Other ISA cards' option when running <CODE>make config</CODE> as
you are actually using the same NE2000 driver as the ISA cards
use. (That should also give you a hint that these cards aren't
anywhere as intelligent as say a PCNet-PCI or DEC 21040 card...)
<P>The newer PCI-only driver differs from the ISA/PCI driver in
that all the support for old NE1000 8 bit cards has been removed
and that data is moved to/from the card in bigger blocks, without
any intervening pauses that the older ISA-NE2000's required for
reliable operation.  The result is a driver that is slightly
smaller and slightly more efficient, but don't get too excited
as the difference will not be obvious under normal use.  (If you
really wanted maximum efficiency/low CPU use, then a PCI-NE2000
is simply a very poor choice.) Driver updates and more
information can be found at:
<P><CODE>http://www.scyld.com/network</CODE>
<P>If you have a NE2000 PCI card that is <EM>not</EM>  detected by
the most current version of the driver, please contact the
maintainer of the NE2000 driver as listed
in <CODE>/usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS</CODE> along with the output
from a <CODE>cat /proc/pci</CODE> and <CODE>dmesg</CODE> so that
support for your card can also be added to the driver.
<P>Also note that various card makers have been known to put
`NE2000 Compatible' stickers on their product boxes even when
it is completely different (e.g. PCNet-PCI or RealTek 8139).
If in doubt check the main chip number against this document.

appears not to work with (at least) the early revision cards.
(This problem is not unique to the Linux world either...)
In that case, you have to supply them to the driver.

added to it for the <CODE>0x52, 0x44</CODE> NI6510EB specific signature.
Others have reported that this signature is not the same
for all NI6510EB cards however, which will cause the lance
driver to not detect your card. If this happens to you, you
can change the probe (at about line 322 in lance.c) to printk()
out what the values are for your card and then use them instead

<H3>WD8003, SMC Elite</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: wd (+8390)
<P>These are the 8-bit versions of the card. The
8 bit 8003 is slightly less expensive, but only
worth the savings for light use. Note that some
of the non-EEPROM cards (clones with jumpers, or
old <EM>old</EM> old wd8003 cards) have no way of reporting
the IRQ line used. In this case, auto-irq is used, and if
that fails, the driver silently assings IRQ 5.
You can get the SMC setup/driver disks from SMC's ftp site.
Note that some of the
newer SMC `SuperDisk' programs will fail to detect
the real old EEPROM-less cards. The file <CODE>SMCDSK46.EXE</CODE>
seems to be a good all-round choice. Also the jumper
settings for all their cards are in an ASCII text file in the
aforementioned archive. The latest (greatest?) version
can be obtained from <CODE>ftp.smc.com</CODE>.
<P>As these are basically the
same as their 16 bit counterparts (WD8013 / SMC Elite16),
you should see the next section for more information.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="8013"></A> WD8013, SMC Elite16</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: wd (+8390)
<P>Over the
years the design has added more registers and an
EEPROM. (The first wd8003 cards appeared about ten years ago!)
Clones usually go by the `8013' name, and
usually use a non-EEPROM (jumpered) design.
Late model SMC cards will have the SMC 83c690 chip instead
of the original Nat Semi DP8390 found on earlier cards.
The shared memory design makes the cards a bit faster
than PIO cards, especially with larger packets.
More importantly, from the
driver's point of view, it avoids a few bugs in the
programmed-I/O mode of the 8390, allows safe
multi-threaded access to the packet buffer, and
it doesn't have a programmed-I/O data register that
hangs your machine during warm-boot probes.
<P>Non-EEPROM cards that can't just read the selected
IRQ will attempt auto-irq, and if that fails, they will
silently assign IRQ 10. (8 bit versions will assign IRQ 5)
<P>Cards with a non standard amount of memory on board can
have the memory size specified at boot (or as an option
in <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> if using modules).
The standard memory size is
8kB for an 8bit card and 16kB for a 16bit card.
For example, the older WD8003EBT cards could be jumpered
for 32kB memory. To make full use of that RAM, you would
use something like (for I/O=0x280 and IRQ 9):

<H3><A NAME="ultra"></A> SMC Elite Ultra</H3>

<P>Status: Supported, Driver Name: smc-ultra (+8390)
<P>This ethercard is based on the
83c790 chip from SMC, which has
a few new features over the 83c690. While it has a mode that is
similar to the older SMC ethercards, it's not entirely
compatible with the old WD80*3 drivers. However, in
this mode it shares most of its code with the other
8390 drivers, while operating slightly faster than a
WD8013 clone.
<P>Since part of the Ultra <EM>looks like</EM>
an 8013, the Ultra probe is supposed to find an
Ultra before the wd8013 probe has a chance to
mistakenly identify it.
<P>Donald mentioned that it is possible to write a separate
driver for the Ultra's `Altego' mode which allows
chaining transmits at the cost of inefficient use of receive
buffers, but that will probably not happen.
<P>Bus-Master SCSI host adaptor users take note: In the
manual that ships with Interactive UNIX, it mentions
that a bug in the SMC Ultra will cause data corruption
with SCSI disks being run from an aha-154X host adaptor.
This will probably bite aha-154X compatible cards, such
as the BusLogic boards, and the AMI-FastDisk SCSI host
adaptors as well.
<P>SMC has acknowledged the problem occurs with
Interactive, and older Windows NT drivers. It is
a hardware conflict with early revisions of the card
that can be worked around in the driver design. The current
Ultra driver protects against this by only enabling the
shared memory during data transfers with the card. Make sure
your kernel version is at least 1.1.84, or that the driver
version reported at boot is at least <CODE>smc-ultra.c:v1.12</CODE>
otherwise you are vulnerable.

<P>This card uses SMC's 83c795 chip and supports the Plug 'n Play

which allows it to be used with the Linux Ultra driver.
For best results, use the SMC supplied program (avail. from
their www/ftp site) to disable PnP and configure it for
shared memory mode.  See the above information for notes on
the Ultra driver.
<P>For v1.2 kernels, the card had to be configured for
shared memory operation. However v2.0 kernels can use the
card in shared memory or programmed I/O mode. Shared
memory mode will be slightly faster, and use
less CPU resources as well.

<H2><A NAME="mystery"></A> <A NAME="ss4.52">4.52 Identifying an Unknown Card</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Okay, so your uncle's cousin's neighbour's friend had a brother
who found an old ISA ethernet card in the AT case he was using as
a cage for his son's pet hampster. Somehow you ended up with
the card and want to try and use it with linux, but nobody
has a clue what the card is and there isn't any documentation.
<P>First of all, look for any obvious model numbers that might
give a clue. Any model number that contains 2000 will most
likely be a NE2000 clone. Any cards with 8003 or 8013
on them somewhere will be Western/Digital WD80x3 cards
or SMC Elite cards or clones of them.
<P>
<H3>Identifying the Network Interface Controller</H3>

<P>Look for the biggest chip on the card. This will be the
network controller (NIC) itself, and most can be identified by
the part number. If you know which NIC is on the card, the
following might be able to help you figure out what card it is.
<P>Probably the most common ISA NIC is the National Semiconductor
DP8390 aka NS32490 aka DP83901 aka DP83902 aka DP83905 aka DP83907.
And those are just the ones made by National! Other companies
such as Winbond and UMC make DP8390 and DP83905 clone parts,
such as the Winbond 89c904 (DP83905 clone) and the UMC 9090.
If the card has some form of 8390 on it, then chances are it
is a ne1000 or ne2000 clone card. The second most common 8390
based card are wd80x3 cards and clones. Cards with a DP83905
can be configured to be an ne2000 <EM>or</EM> a wd8013. Never versions
of the genuine wd80x3 and SMC Elite cards have an 83c690 in place
of the original DP8390. The SMC Ultra cards have an 83c790,
and use a slightly different driver than the wd80x3 cards.
The SMC EtherEZ cards have an 83c795, and use the same driver
as the SMC Ultra. All BNC cards based on some sort of 8390 or
8390 clone will usually have an 8392 (or 83c692, or ???392)
16 pin DIP chip very close to the BNC connector.
<P>Another common NIC found on older cards is the Intel i82586.
Cards having this NIC include the 3c505, 3c507, 3c523, Intel
EtherExpress-ISA, Microdyne Exos-205T, and the Racal-Interlan NI5210.
<P>The original AMD LANCE NIC was numbered AM7990, and newer
revisions include the 79c960, 79c961, 79c965, 79c970, and 79c974.
Most cards with one of the above will work with the Linux LANCE
driver, with the exception of the old Racal-Interlan NI6510
cards that have their own driver.
<P>Newer PCI cards having a DEC 21040, 21041, 21140, or similar
number on the NIC should be able to use the linux tulip or
de4x5 driver.
<P>Other PCI cards having a big chip marked RTL8029 or
89C940 or 86C926 are ne2000 clone cards, and the ne2k-pci driver 
should automatically detect these cards.
<P>
<H3>Identifying the Ethernet Address</H3>

<P>
<P>Each ethernet card has its own six byte address that is
unique to that card. The first three bytes of that address
are the same for each card made by that particular manufacturer.
For example all SMC cards start with <CODE>00:00:c0</CODE>.
The last three are assigned by the manufacturer uniquely to each
individual card as they are produced.
<P>If your card has a sticker on it giving all six bits of its
address, you can look up the vendor from the first three.
However it is more common to see only the last three bytes
printed onto a sticker attached to a socketed PROM,
which tells you nothing.
<P>You can determine which vendors have which assigned addresses
from RFC-1340. Apparently there is a more up to date listing
available in various places as well. Try a WWW or FTP search
for <CODE>EtherNet-codes</CODE> or <CODE>Ethernet-codes</CODE> and you will
find something.

<H3>Identifying the Card by the FCC ID Number</H3>

<P>
<P>As part of the certification process a card typically
has to pass before being sold to the user, it gets tested
by the FCC, and from this gets a FCC ID which is supposed
to be printed on the card somewhere. For example, a
card has on it <CODE>FCC ID: J158013EWC</CODE> - and this
card happens to be a SMC/WD8013-EWC. Some web sites
like <CODE>www.driverguide.com</CODE> and <CODE>drdriver.com</CODE>
make use of listings of FCC IDs that may help with less
obvious ID numbers.  The FCC itself has a search tool
that may also help, and it is at:

<H3>Tips on Trying to Use an Unknown Card</H3>

<P>
<P>If you are still not sure what the card is, but have at least
narrowed it down some, then you can build a kernel with a
whole bunch of drivers included, and see if any of them
autodetect the card at boot.
<P>If the kernel doesn't detect the card, it may be that the
card is not configured to one of the addresses that the
driver probes when looking for a card. In this case, you
might want to try getting <CODE>scanport.tar.gz</CODE> from your
local linux ftp site, and see if that can locate where your
card is jumpered for. It scans ISA I/O space from <CODE>0x100</CODE>
to <CODE>0x3ff</CODE> looking for devices that aren't registered in
<CODE>/proc/ioports</CODE>. If it finds an unknown device starting
at some particular address, you can then explicity point the
ethernet probes at that address with an <CODE>ether=</CODE> boot
argument.
<P>If you manage to get the card detected, you can then
usually figure out the unknown jumpers by changing them
one at a time and seeing at what I/O base and IRQ that the
card is detected at. The IRQ settings can also usually be
determined by
following the traces on the back of the card to where the
jumpers are soldered through. Counting the `gold fingers'
on the backside, from the end of the card with the metal bracket,
you have IRQ 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 10, 11, 12, 15, 14 at fingers
4, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 respectively.
Eight bit cards only have up to finger 31.
<P>Jumpers that appear to do nothing usually are for selecting
the memory address of an optional boot ROM. Other jumpers that
are located near the BNC or RJ-45 or AUI connectors are usually
to select the output media. These are also typically near
the `black box' voltage converters marked YCL, Valor, or Fil-Mag.

be found at the following URL:

<H2><A NAME="ss4.53">4.53 Drivers for Non-Ethernet Devices</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are a few other drivers that are in the linux source
that present an <EM>ethernet-like</EM> device to network
programs, while not really being ethernet. These are briefly
listed here for completeness.
<P><CODE>dummy.c</CODE> - The purpose of this driver is to provide a device
to point a route through, but not to actually transmit packets.
<P><CODE>eql.c</CODE> - Load Equalizer, enslaves multiple devices (usually
modems) and balances the Tx load across them while presenting
a single device to the network programs.
<P><CODE>ibmtr.c</CODE> - IBM Token Ring, which is not really ethernet.
Broken-Ring requires source routing and other uglies.
<P><CODE>loopback.c</CODE> - Loopback device, for which all packets
from your machine and destined for your own machine go.
It essentially just moves the packet off the Tx queue and
onto the Rx queue.
<P><CODE>pi2.c</CODE> - Ottawa Amateur Radio Club PI and PI2 interface.
<P><CODE>plip.c</CODE> - Parallel Line Internet Protocol, allows two
computers to send packets to each other over two joined
parallel ports in a point-to-point fashion.
<P><CODE>ppp.c</CODE> - Point-to-Point Protocol (RFC1331, 1548. 1661), for
the Transmission of Multi-protocol Datagrams over a
Point-to-Point Link (again usually modems).
<P><CODE>slip.c</CODE> - Serial Line Internet Protocol, allows two
computers to send packets to each other over two joined
serial ports (usually via modems) in a point-to-point fashion.
<P><CODE>tunnel.c</CODE> - Provides an IP tunnel through which you can
tunnel network traffic transparently across subnets
<P><CODE>wavelan.c</CODE> - An Ethernet-like radio transceiver
controlled by the Intel 82586 coprocessor which is used on
other ethercards such as the Intel EtherExpress.
