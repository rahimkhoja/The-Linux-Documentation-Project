>This is not meant to be a guide on how to set up your specific monitor,  or videocard.  In fact,  I assume that you already have X Window running for your setup.  Please refer to the XF86 Documentation for more information. </P
><P
>If you are using a single multiheaded card you will need to refer to your video card manufacturers instructions.  I know that both nVidia and Matrox support Linux multihead setups.  nVidia includes some documentation with their drivers, but I don't have one of these cards to test with so I don't have any specific details. </P
><P
>As far as I know,  there are no limits to which video cards you can configure this way,  nor does it seem to matter if you mix different types of video cards in a setup,  The sample configuration I use in this documentation uses two different video cards,  an AGP Fire GL 1000 and a PCI Matrox Millenium II.  What effect this has on 3d Accelleration I don't know as I don't currently accellerate either of my video cards.</P
><P
>This Howto assumes that you know how to edit text files,  do basic video card configuration for X Window, add and remove hardware from your system, start and stop system services, and follow simple instructions.  If feel you will have trouble with any of these things,  please seek help.  I am not responsible if you damage any of your stuff.</P
