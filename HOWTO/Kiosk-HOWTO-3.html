<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 FVWM2</A>
</H2>

<P>FVWM2 (FVWM, version 2 -- www.fvwm.org) is a flexible, reliable, and
lightweight X Window manager that provides excellent configurability
for creating a kiosk environment. For kiosk use you must change some
of its default settings. You need to modify the system.fvwm2rc file to
remove things like virtual desktops, title bars, exit controls, etc,
leaving a relatively minimalist FVWM environment. Because the kiosk is
a standalone unit, modifying the system-wide settings does not present
a problem.
<P>You can also take advantage of FVWM's settable object properties to
use X Window bitmaps (xpm files) to mask the parts of Netscape
Navigator you don't want users to access.
<P>The FVWM2 file you need to modify is
/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc. (If you use a different distribution
than Red Hat, this file may be located elsewhere.) You may have to
poke around in this file to find the sections listed below.
<P>
<H3>/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc</H3>

<P>In <CODE>/etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc</CODE> change
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DeskTopSize 2X2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DeskTopSize 1X1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This eliminates the virtual desktops.
<P>Next, in the Default Styles section, change
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Style "*"           BorderWidth 7, HandleWidth 7
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Style "*"           BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, notitle, nohandles
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will disable most of the normal windowing controls.
<P>Add the following two lines to the Default Styles section:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Style "xdaliclock"  StaysOnTop
Style "sxpm"        StaysOnTop 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Default Styles part of the file should look something like this
when you finish:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# default Styles:
#Style "*"           BorderWidth 7, HandleWidth 7
Style "*"           BorderWidth 0, HandleWidth 0, notitle, nohandles
Style "*"           Icon unknown1.xpm, Color lightgrey/dimgrey
Style "*"           MWMFunctions, MWMDecor, HintOverride
Style "*"           DecorateTransient, NoPPosition
Style "*"           IconBox 0 -10 -280 -1
Style "*"           FocusFollowsMouse
Style "*"           RandomPlacement, SmartPlacement
Style "xdaliclock"  StaysOnTop
Style "sxpm"        StaysOnTop
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can use the xdaliclock and sxpm programs to cover up parts of
Netscape Navigator. The ``StaysOnTop'' attribute is the active
ingredient.
<P>Next, find the following four lines and comment them out as shown:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#AddToFunc InitFunction         "I" Module FvwmButtons
#+                      "I" exec xsetroot -mod 2 2 -fg \#554055 -bg \#705070

#AddToFunc RestartFunction "I" Module FvwmButtons
#+                      "I" exec xsetroot -mod 2 2 -fg \#554055 -bg \#705070
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Commenting out these lines will eliminate the nice task launcher from
FVWM2, which is okay because you're after as simple an environment as
you can create.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Netscape Navigator</A>
</H2>

<P>Netscape Navigator is a better choice for setting up a kiosk than
Netscape Communicator. Being simpler, there are fewer objects to hide.
<P>Under Microsoft Windows, Netscape Navigator has a kiosk mode that
eliminates most of the Navigator controls but there is, at the time of
this writing, no built-in kiosk mode for the Unix version of
Navigator.
<P>The Unix version can, however, be invoked with a <CODE>-geometry</CODE>
argument that allows us to always start Netscape full screen. This
forms part of our strategy for a Netscape-based kiosk.
<P>You need to decide on our kiosk screen resolution. Using a 19- or
20-inch monitor, we found 640x480 too large, 1024x768 too small, and
800x600 just about right for public viewing (you may decide
differently). Once you decide on the resolution, you are ready to
begin adjusting Navigator. For the rest of this HOWTO we assume
800x600 resolution. You'll need to adjust accordingly if you select a
different resolution.
<P><I>Note:</I> Navigator is going to be invoked by root during bootup,
so make all of the Netscape adjustments under the root account in the
<CODE>/root/.netscape</CODE> directory.
<P>Invoke Netscape and click into the <CODE>Edit, Preferences</CODE>
dialog. Under <CODE>Appearance</CODE> check ``Show Toolbar as Text Only.''
Under <CODE>Appearance, Fonts</CODE> adjust both fixed- and variable-width
fonts to at least 14pt or the screen display will be too small for
comfortable reading.
<P>Under <CODE>Preferences, Navigator</CODE> insert the URL of your kiosk
home page. If you're running a local version of Apache or another web
server, make this <CODE>http://localhost/</CODE> for top level access, or
deeper into the html doctree if desired.
<P>Save these options, then click <CODE>View</CODE> on the Navigator menu
bar. Deselect <CODE>Personal Toolbar</CODE> and <CODE>Location
Bar</CODE>.
<P>Notice how much more kiosk-like the interface has become? When you
exit Navigator, these settings will be saved.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Overlay Masks for Navigator</A>
</H2>

<P>If you look closely at your adjusted Navigator screen, you'll see four
areas that need to be covered and protected from mouse or trackball
clicks:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Toolbar at the top</LI>
<LI>The twister at the left-hand side of the navigation toolbar</LI>
<LI>The rest of the navbar to the right of Home</LI>
<LI>The security key in the lower left-hand corner of
Navigator.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Here's a rough schematic of the areas you need to mask:

<P>To mask over the top areas (#1-3), we'll need three graphic images. To
mask the security key (#4) we'll use xdaliclock.
<P>
<H3>Creating the Graphical Masks</H3>

<P>The easiest way to create graphical masks to cover areas #1-3 is to
grab a screenshot of Navigator in full 800x600 mode and then crop out
areas that correspond to #1-3. I used GIMP for this.
<P>You can then re-design the basic graphics, changing the colors if you
wish, or putting your own logo on them. Save them as:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>topbar.xpm</LI>
<LI>navleft.xpm</LI>
<LI>navright.xpm</LI>
</OL>
<P>The xpm format is the native X Window bitmap format. You will use the
X Window program <I>sxpm</I> to place them on the screen.
<P>Creating the masks with just the right number of pixels and just the
right placement on the monitor requires some experimentation. For your
convenience, I have placed the xpm files we created plus our
configuration files in at the following web site: 
<A HREF="http://www.rom.on.ca/kiosk/HOWTO/">http://www.rom.on.ca/kiosk/HOWTO/</A>. You may find it simpler to
download our masks and use them as a starting point for your own
graphics.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 /root/kiosk.xinitrc</A>
</H2>

<P>Just as you would normally create a .xinitrc file for your personal
use, you must create an X Window session initialization file for our
kiosk application. The following script implements a number of
features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Screensaver initialization (optional)</LI>
<LI>Placement of graphic bitmap over Navigator menu bar (topnav.xpm)</LI>
<LI>Placement of graphic bitmap over navigation bar twiser (navleft.xpm)</LI>
<LI>Placement of graphic bitmap over rest of navbar (navright.xpm)</LI>
<LI>Xdaliclock placement over Navigator security key (adjusted for
800x600 screen resolution)</LI>
<LI>Netscape startup and loop checks to make sure Navigator is running,
and to re-run it if it isn't.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This is the main file that runs the kiosk.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 /root/xkiosk</A>
</H2>

<P>You can now start testing your kiosk setup. Since you will need to do
this repeatedly, manually, as well as from an initialization script,
create the following as a shell script named /root/xkiosk:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
/usr/X11R6/bin/xinit /root/kiosk.xinitrc -- /usr/X11R6/bin/X \
-xf86config /root/kiosk.XF86Config bc
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Because you will be testing often, and reusing this later when you
automate the startup, create this command as a shell script called
<CODE>/root/xkiosk</CODE>. Be sure to <CODE>chmod ug+x</CODE> it.
