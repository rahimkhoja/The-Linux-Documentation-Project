>3.1. How to test whether it works</H2
><P
>&#13;     Ok ... you use one of the described powersaving possibilitys and you want to verify, whether
     it works. Here are two ways to check it:
  </P
><P
>&#13;     If you have temperature controlled Fan on your CPU-Heatsink, you could check for the noise level of the Fan to see whether it works or not. After a few idle minutes you give the CPU somthing to do.
  <DIV
CLASS="procedure"
><P
><B
>I normaly do it like this:</B
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
>get superuser (root)
  </LI
><LI
><B
CLASS="command"
>cd /usr/src/linux</B
></LI
><LI
>and give the computer something to do: <B
CLASS="command"
>while true; do make clean; make bzImage; done</B
></LI
></OL
></DIV
>
  After about 20 or 30 seconds you should notice that the noise of the fan is getting louder while the fan is getting faster. Don't forget to end the while-loop after some time ( a few minutes) with STRG-C.
  </P
><P
>&#13;     The same procedure as above works also with a monitoring program for the cpu-temperature (like <A

>3.2. Known Bugs/Problems</H2
><P
>There are two known bugs in the Athlon/Duron processor. This is number 
  11 and number 14 in the <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>AMD Athlon Processor Revision Guide</I
>. It looks like the Athlon XP is significantly less often affected by these bugs. So if you have an Athlon XP you are on the lucky side (like me).</P
><P
>There could be following problems (caused by the bugs):
  <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>skips during sound playback</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>skips and slowdown during video playback</P

>USB problems</P

><P
>someone reported a high cheeping noise</P
></LI
></UL

  </P
><P
>Sometimes a BIOS-update will help (it exists as a workaround for 
  bug 11, which could be done by the BIOS). But as far as I know there are 
  only a few boards out there which have this workaround in the BIOS.</P
><P
>For the Asus A7V133-C, it is known that the BIOS-option <TT
CLASS="option"
>PCI master read caching</TT
> will solve most problems when it is enabled. So look
  at your BIOS to see whether it has such functionality.</P
><P
>It is also known that on some boards, the BIOS option <TT
CLASS="option"
>Delayed Transaction</TT
> solves some of the problems. You may want to give this option a try too.</P
><P
>WARNING:  On boards with KT133A, this could enable the famous VIA-Southbridge bug!</P

></LI
><LI
><P
>you have a K7S5A (as far as I know, this board could be really wierd when power-saving is enabled)</P
></LI
></UL

  </P
><P
>&#13;     If you have minor problems with power-saving enabled, and nevertheless want to use 
     power-saving, you can enable the power-saving by default, and turn it off if you
     want to playback music, watch TV, ...

>3.3. Fix for sound skips and other problems</H2
><P
>Thank you to Michael Hamilton for submitting me the idea how it works.</P
><P
>The working of this Fix was confirmed by two People, so it looks like it works, but it may not work for everyone. Please feel free to submit further experiences!</P
><P
>Lets go: It looks like at least the sound skips are curable by maximizing the pci latency timer of the device.</P
><P
>First you have to find the "pci-address" of your Soundcard. This could be done with <B
CLASS="command"
>lspci</B
>. You have to look for something like "Multimedia audio controller" or "AudioPCI". Take the "pci-address" of the device (looks like something like that: 01:06.0 -&#62; it stands for: bus:slot.function) and maximize the latency timer for it. This is done by setpci:</P
><P
><B
CLASS="command"
>setpci -v -s "pci-address" latency_timer=ff</B
></P
><P
>For additional Information on the Latency Timer you could look <A
HREF="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-hw2.html"
TARGET="_top"
>here.</A
></P
><P
>Maybe this works also for other problems like USB-Problems and Harddisk-Transfer-Slowdowns, but this hasn't been tested for now. Feel free to test it (but don't blame me, if it doesn't work or makes everything worse) and report whether it works. The problem is, that i have none of this problems and so can't test this by myself.</P
><P
>If it works, you have to perform this setpci command at every startup/reboot of the Computer. So it would be wise to put it in one of the init-scripts (after the driver module is loaded!).</P
