   The range is inversely proportional to the speed you can send data at.

   nice and low and data will come through. BUT, from my experience, it's
   not the RIGHT data. It's not being analyzed in the right way, and as
   such, you can't compute the checksums or check it with its complement.

   ASKIR in most laptops etc. is not meant for remote IR devices. ASKIR
   is meant for Sharp Wizard and Zaurus PDAs and some of Sharp's notebook
   PCs. Sharp stated this long before IrDA was established and is still
   supporting it to maintain backward compatibility. Apple's Newton had
   this capability at one time, too.
</P

>&#13;   Briefly, ASKIR uses 9.6 Kbps (19.2 and 38.4 Kbps are also possible)
   asynchronous data format of 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and odd parity.
   The start bit as well as all 0 bit in data/parity are transmitted as
   IR square wave at 500 KHz (DASK sub-carrier). The stop bit as well as
   all 1 bit in data/parity are represented by the absence of any IR
   transmission.

</P

>&#13;   True. Not only can you use SIR hardware to receive, you can transmit,
   too. Of course, there are some limitations.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Most IR remote controls use 38 KHz sub-carrier. 3 times 38 is 114,
   very close to 115.2. You can set the UART to operate at 115.2 Kbps, 7
   data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit - a total of 9 bits. Each 3
   cycles of the 38 KHz sub-carrier can be received or transmitted as a
   byte of 0x5B.
</P
><P
>&#13;   There are some physical limitations in addition to the fact that the
   sub-carrier must be 38 KHz. The SIR receiver is not as sensitive to 38
   KHz as the IR remote receiver designed for that. The SIR transmitter
   has a much lower duty cycle and thus can not emit a strong sub-carrier
   either.
</P
><P
>&#13;   IR remote encodes the control signal by turning on and off the
   sub-carrier at certain specific patterns. Now that you can transmit
   and receive the sub-carrier, what remains is all in timing.
</P
><P
>&#13;   For transmit, you have to know how many consecutive bytes of 0x5B to
   send for each burst of the sub-carrier, and how long to be quiet
   between the bursts.

</P
><P
>&#13;   It is somewhat intuitive that when the link is not reliable we put the
   two devices closer together. But it is counterintuitive that too close
   is not good either. The reason is that the light intensity at 1 cm is
   10.000 times brighter than that at 100 cm. At 0.5 cm, it is 40.000
   times, etc. The IR receiver manufacturers have difficulties to cover
   this huge dynamic range. We all have problems reading under a 10 W
   light bulb, but imagine how it feels under a 100.000 W light!
</P
><P
>&#13;   The IrDA Physical Layer is totally incompatible with the DASK
   modulation used in IR remote controls. Thus it is not possible to use
   the same controller function for both FIR and remote control. However,
   practically all FIR controller chips do include some additional
   functions to support remote control. National, SMC, and Winbond (just
   to name a few) all have such I/O chips.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The IR transmitter for FIR and remote control are very similar. I have
   tried a standard FIR transmitter. It can reach 10 meters for remote
   control purpose. Thus it performs just as good as transmitters
   designed for remote control.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The IR receiver for FIR and remote control are somewhat different. A
   FIR receiver can receive remote control signals but can reach only 1
   meter whereas receivers designed for remote control typically can
   reach 10 meters.

>&#13;   I have an ISA bus adapter with a National I/O chip that supports both
   FIR and remote control. I also have IR Dongles that include both FIR
   and remote control receivers. (Plus a transmitter for both modes.) I
   cannot find any software to support remote control functions. I did my
   own experiments in DOS (I cannot run Linux yet.) Anybody interest in
   this? "

>&#13;   "Normal" IrDA (using IrLAP) is _not_ well suited for remote control
   because of the connection oriented nature (and just supports 9600bps
   for connectionless use). The reason for the limited range is
   eye-safety they say (but I currently don't know why CIR works better
   using the same power). I have however seen laptops connect at 4-5
   meters (but I don't think that any high speed communication would be
   possible).

>&#13;   Most IrDA chipsets are capable of CIR operation, and it is quite easy
   to modify the drivers so they talk CIR. Takahide Higuchi has started
   to look at IrSockets and it would be great if we could open a "raw"
   Ir(DA) socket which then could send and receive CIR packets. Then all
   the CIR applications could live in userspace.

   : " It is possible to transmit and receive

   Transceiver Performance with ASK and TV Remote Signals."

>&#13;   Fortunately, many IrDA devices are compatible with the 38-kbps ASK
   modulation used in TV remotes. This means that they can work with such
   kind of infrared type signals. ... However, it seems that there are
   still many portable computers that can't receive TV infrared stuff.
</P
><P
>&#13;   For desktop computers, there exist two options, depending on the
   motherboard you have. Usually a Pentium MoBo has an I/O chipset ready
   for infrared communication. There is a special connector where you can
   connect the transducer. The other option is buying a serial type
   transceiver that connects to the standard serial port (RS-232) of the
   computer. ... PC Remote Control has been tested with success using
   both type of IrDA devices:
</P
><P
>&#13;   1) IRmate IR-210 Serial Port Infrared Adapter. ... The serial port
   speed at wich the device sends recognizable data values is 2400 bps. I
   don't know if this speed will be the same for all the adapters of this
   type or is an unique characteristic of this model.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Look at the examples of data values received to see how similar are
   them. There are some infrared commands that change a lot every time,
   difficulting the recognition. In such cases, a great tolerance in the
   comparison could be used, but the risk of confusion between different
   commands will be increased. An apropiate tolerance value for almost
   all cases is 20.
</P
><P
>&#13;   2) Actisys IR2000L connected to an Asus P2B motherboard. ... There are
   several serial port speeds that work well, although 4800 bps seems to
   be the best one. Other adapters of this same type work also well using
   this speed. Take a look at the samples of data sequences received
   using this device. Some remote buttons send exactly the same sequence
   and it's impossible to distinguish between them at all.
</P
><P
>&#13;   3) Asus IR-eye connected to the same MoBo as above. It works as well
   as the Actisys device.
</P
><P
>&#13;   TV remotes send commands only one way, in a low-speed burst for
   distances of up to 30 feet. They use directed IR with LEDs that have a
   moderate cone angle to improve ease-of-use characteristics. Cordless
   connectivity via IrDA transfers files, point-to-point and
   bidirectionally, in a high-speed burst for short distances using
   directed IR with LEDs having a narrow cone angle. IrDA transmissions
   require relatively careful aiming, and they're easy to block. For this
   reason, don't expect a great distance while working with the remote
   unit.
