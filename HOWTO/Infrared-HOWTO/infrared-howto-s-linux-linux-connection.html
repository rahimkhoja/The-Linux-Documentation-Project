   may wonder what prevents the beaming of files from Linux to Linux?
   Well, nothing!! (but I haven't tried that yet). This means that we
   now have a "simple" way of beaming files between Linux laptops. I
   think that this may be the "killer app" we all have been waiting
   for!" Try to "load_misc irobex at both ends, and then try
   irobex_app get on one of the machines and irobex_app put &#60;file&#62; on

   But the IrLAN protocol is no longer maintained
   by the Linux/IrDA core team.

>&#13;   With IrCOMM support, in other words over a serial line, which
   could mean minicom, pppd, etc. If you want just now to use IrCOMM
   between Linux boxes, please add this line to /etc/conf.modules of
   _one_ box:

   Note: Don't add it to both boxes, or they cannot accept incoming
   connection each other! But since 2.2.7 there's no need to add
   options ircomm ircomm_cs=1 to /etc/conf.modules anymore. Please
   remove it if you are using it.

   to IrLAP! As you may know, this is _not_ part of the IrDA(TM)
   standard, but Linux can now negotiate with its peer and check if it
   has the same compression capabilities). So obviously if you are
   talking to Win95, Palm III or whatever, you will _not_ get
   compression!!! This is something which is exclusive for Linux as far
   as I know! The IrDA(TM) standard says that devices should ignore
   unknown field in the negotiation header, so we are still "compatible"
   with IrDA(TM) (have just borrowed an unused header value).

   1950 to 1952 in the files ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib
   format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).

>&#13;   The compression interface is similar to PPP, so you can add as many
   different compressors as you want. Currently there is only support for
   GZIP, but BSD compression will be added later. ... Have just tested
   GZIP compression at 4Mbps. It was a really bad idea! Compressing the
   frames takes so much time that the performance is actually worse than
   when not using compression at all. The conclusion is that compression
   should only be used for SIR speeds, ..."
