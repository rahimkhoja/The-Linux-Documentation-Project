>&#13;   Some caveats in the documentation have been caused by changes of the following
   concepts, device names and parameters. I hope I have got them alright now, they confused me
   sometimes, too. The new style stuff works from Kernel 2.2.15 / 2.4.0.
   Some important changes were made again in Kernel 2.6, not all of these are
   mentioned in this document yet, I will fix that hopefully soon.
   Anyway I recommend not to use any earlier kernel version than 2.6.
   This document will describe
   differences to the kernel 2.4 series in the appropriate places
   to provide documentation for situations where you must
   use kernel 2.4, which is hopefully rare.
   
   You should always use current Kernel, irda-utils and documentation.
