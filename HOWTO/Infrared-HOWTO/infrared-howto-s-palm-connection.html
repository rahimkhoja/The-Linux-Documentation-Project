   flawlessly. Although I was able to establish a PPP connection, I'm
   still unable to fetch mail and do Web browsing. This is probably
   due to connection time-outs. I am checking this out. Please see

   I managed to establish an apparently robust connection between
   my Linux box and a Palm III. The pppd invocation I use is as
   follows:

   Over the PPP connection I used <B

   Strange is however the fact that discovery must be enabled (maybe
   obsolete) . Otherwise, even with an active IrCOMM connection, the
   link goes down due to a IrLAP disconnect.
   The pilot-link tools (used for Linux/Palm synchronization) also
   ran flawlessly over IrCOMM via <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/ircomm0</TT
>."
   There are also reports about <B

   flawlessly as <B

   , and then you can run a terminal program (like PalmTelnet in serial mode) over
   IrDA. I can only assume it's using the IrCOMM protocol. I've
   tested this configuration between two Palm Pilots, but of course I
   can't know what the protocol running over the IR is."
   (1) Start HotSync on your Palm. You need the

   (2) Place the Palm in front of the dongle.
   (3) Start <B
CLASS="command"
>pilot-xfer -p /dev/ircomm0 -s &#60;sync-dir&#62;</B

   And if you are lucky it will start syncing. If you start

   be lucky!
   Maybe a terminal program like <B
CLASS="command"
>PalmTerm</B

   <A

   (a former version of this HOWTO referred to it as MTerm)
   is also useful.

   Peter Pregler reported: If the Palm enters the range of the
   irda-device a popup appears with the text "Transmission: waiting for
   sender"

   that is supposed to help with this problem of annoying popup I haven't
   tried it but it looks like it would fix your problem.
