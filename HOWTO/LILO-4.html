<P>Lilo allows to map the kernel image from one disk and instruct the
BIOS to retrieve it from another disk. For example, it's common for me
to install Linux on a disk I connect to <CODE>hdc</CODE> (master disk of
secondary controller) and boot it as a standalong system on the primary
IDE controller of another computer. I copied the installation floppy
to a tiny partition, so I can run <EM>chroot</EM> in a virtual
console to install <CODE>hdc</CODE> while I use the system to do something else.</P>

<P>The <EM>lilo.conf</EM> file I use to install Lilo looks like:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
# This file must be used from a system running off /dev/hdc
boot = /dev/hdc   # overwrite MBR of hdc
disk = /dev/hdc   # tell how hdc will look like:
   bios = 0x80    #  the bios will see it as first drive
delay = 0
vga = 0

image = /boot/vmlinux  # this is on /dev/hdc1
  root = /dev/hda1     # but at boot it will be hda1
  label = Linux
  read-only
</PRE>
</P>

<P>This configuration file must be read by a Lilo running <B>off
/dev/hdc1</B>.  The Lilo maps that get written the boot sector
(<CODE>/dev/hdc</CODE>) must refer to the files in <CODE>/boot</CODE>
(currently installed as hdc); such files will be accessed under hda
when this disk will be booted as a standalone system.</P>

<P>I call this configuration file <CODE>/mnt/etc/lilo.conf.hdc</CODE>
(<CODE>/mnt</CODE> is where hdc is mounted during the installation. I
install Lilo by invoking ``<CODE>cd /mnt; chroot . sbin/lilo -C
/etc/lilo.conf.hdc</CODE>''. Refer to the manual page for
<EM>chroot</EM> if this looks magic.</P>

<P>The ``<CODE>bios=</CODE>'' directive in <CODE>lilo.conf</CODE> is used to tell
Lilo what the BIOS thinks of your devices. BIOS calls identify floppy
disks and hard drives with a number: 0x00 and 0x01 select the floppy
drives, 0x80 and the following numbers select hard disks (old BIOS-es
can only access two disks). The meaning of ``<CODE>bios = 0x80</CODE> in
the previous sample file is therefore ``use 0x80 in your BIOS calls
for <CODE>/dev/hdc</CODE>''.</P>

<P>This Lilo directive can be handy in other situations, for example when
your BIOS is able to boot from SCSI disks instead of IDE ones. When
both IDE and SCSI devices are there, Lilo can't tell whether 0x80 will
refer to one or the other because the user is able to choose it in the
BIOS configuration menus, and the BIOS can't be accessed while Linux
is running.</P>

<P>By default, Lilo assumes that IDE drives are mapped first by the BIOS,
but this can be overridden by using instructions like these in
<CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE>:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
disk = /dev/sda
  bios = 0x80
</PRE>
</P>
