<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Email and spamming </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To send mail to anyone mentioned in this document, convert "at" in
email addresses to "@".
<P>This conversion is simple for humans, but not spammers' address
harvesters; therefore it's useful to protect generous contributors
from being spammed!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Goals </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The intent of this document is to answer some of the questions and comments
that appear to meet the definition of "frequently asked questions" about e-mail
software under Linux in general and the version in the Linux Debian and
RedHat distributions in particular.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 New versions </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>New versions of this document will be periodically posted to
comp.os.linux.announce, comp.answers and mail.answers.  They will
also be added to the various anonymous ftp sites who archive such
information including <EM>sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO</EM>.
<P>In addition, you should be generally able to find this document on the
Linux WorldWideWeb home page at <EM>http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html</EM>.

<P>
<P>I am interested in any feedback, positive or negative, regarding the content
of this document via e-mail.  Definitely contact me if you find errors or
obvious omissions.
<P>I read, but do not necessarily respond to, all e-mail I receive.  Requests for
enhancements will be considered and acted upon based on that day's combination
of available time, merit of the request and daily blood pressure :-)
<P>Flames will quietly go to /dev/null so don't bother.

coordinator : Tim Bynum (<CODE>howto at wallybox.cei.net</CODE>).
