<P>I intend to produce regular updates to this document as long as I have
both enough time to do it, and something interesting to say.  This means
that I am eager to hear comments from readers.  Could my writing be clearer?
Can you think of something that would make matters easier?  Is there some
new tool that does it all automatically?  Whatever.  If you have something
to say about this document or about the <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> or <CODE>e2recover</CODE> tools,
drop me a line on <CODE>
