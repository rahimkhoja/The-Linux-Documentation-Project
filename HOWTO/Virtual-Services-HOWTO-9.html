<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Virtual Mail/Pop</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Problem</A>
</H2>

<P>Virtual mail support is in ever increasing demand.  Sendmail says
it supports virtual mail.  What it does support is listening
for incoming mail from different domains.  You can then specify to 
have the mail forwarded somewhere.  However, if you forward it to
the local machine and have incoming mail to bob@domain1.com 
and bob@domain2.com they will go to the same mail folder.  This is a 
problem since both bob's are different people with different mail.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Solution</A>
</H2>

<P>You can make sure that each user name is unique by using a 
numbering scheme: bob1, bob2, etc or prepending a few characters
to each username dom1bob, dom2bob, etc.  You could also hack
mail and pop to do these conversions behind the scenes but
that can get messy.  Outgoing mail also has the banner 
maindomain.com and you want each subdomain's outgoing mail
banner to be different.  
<P>
<P>I have two solutions.  One works with sendmail and one works
with Qmail.  The solution with sendmail should work with a stock install of
sendmail.  However, it shares all the limitations built into sendmail.
It also requires that one sendmail has to be run in queue mode for
each domain.  Having 50 or more sendmail queue processes that wake
up every hour can put a little strain on a machine.
<P>
<P>The solution offered with Qmail does not require multiple instances of Qmail 
and can run out of one queue directory.  It does require an extra program
since Qmail does not rely on virtuald.  I believe a similar procedure can be 
done with sendmail.  However, Qmail lends itself to this solution more 
readily.
<P>
<P>I do not endorse any one program over the other.  The sendmail install
is a little more straight forward but Qmail is probably the more powerful
of the two mail server packages.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Sendmail Solution</A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Each virtual filesystem gives a domain its own /etc/passwd.  This
means that bob@domain1.com and bob@domain2.com are different users
in different /etc/passwds so mail will be no problem.  They also
have their own spool directories so the mail folders will be
different files on different virtual filesystems.
<P>
<H3>Create Sendmail Configuration File</H3>

<P>Create /etc/sendmail.cf like you would normally through m4.  I used:
<P>
<PRE>
divert(0)
VERSIONID(`tcpproto.mc')
OSTYPE(linux)
FEATURE(redirect)
FEATURE(always_add_domain)
FEATURE(use_cw_file)
FEATURE(local_procmail)
MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Edit Sendmail Configuration File</H3>

<P>Edit /virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cf to respond as your virtual domain:
<P>
<PRE>
vi /virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cf # Approximately Line 86 
It should say:

#Dj$w.Foo.COM

Replace it with:

Djdomain1.com
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Sendmail Local Delivery</H3>

<P>Edit /virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cw with the local hostnames.
<P>
<PRE>
vi /virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cw
mail.domain1.com
domain1.com
domain1
localhost
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Sendmail Between Virtual Domains: The Hack (PRE8.8.6)</H3>

<P>However, sendmail requires one minor source code modification.  
Sendmail has a file called /etc/sendmail.cw and it contains all machine names
that sendmail will deliver mail to locally rather than forwarding
to another machine.  Sendmail does internal checking of all
the devices on the machine to initialize this list with the
local IPs.  This presents a problem if you are mailing
between virtual domains on the same machine.  Sendmail will be 
fooled into thinking another virtual domain is a local address and 
spool the mail locally.  For example, bob@domain1.com sends mail 
to fred@domain2.com.  Since domain1.com's sendmail thinks domain2.com 
is local, it will spool the mail on domain1.com and never send it to 
domain2.com.  You have to modify sendmail (I did this on v8.8.5 without 
a problem):
<P>
<PRE>
vi v8.8.5/src/main.c # Approximately Line 494
It should say:

load_if_names();

Replace it with:

/* load_if_names(); Commented out since hurts virtual */
</PRE>
<P>Note only do this if you need to send mail between virtual domains which
I think is probable.  
<P>This will fix the problem.  However, the main ethernet device eth0
is not removed.  Therefore, if you send mail from a virtual IP to the
one on eth0 on the same box it will delivery locally.  Therefore, I 
just use this as a dummy IP virtual1.maindomain.com (10.10.10.157).  I never 
send mail to this host so neither will the virtual domains.  This
is also the IP I would use to ssh into the box to check if the system is ok.  
<P>
<H3>Sendmail Between Virtual Domains: New Sendmail Feature (POST8.8.6)</H3>

<P>As of Sendmail V8.8.6, there is a new option to disable loading of the
extra network interfaces.  This means you do NOT have to alter the
code in any way.  It is called <CODE> DontProbeInterfaces </CODE>.
<P>
<P>Edit /virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cf
<P>
<PRE>
vi /virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cf # Add the line
O DontProbeInterfaces=True
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Sendmail.init </H3>

<P>Sendmail cannot be started stand alone anymore so you have to
run it through inetd.  This is inefficient and will result in
lower start up time but if you had such a high hit site you would
not share it on a virtual box with other domains.  Note that you
are NOT running with the <CODE> -bd </CODE> flag.  Also note that
you need a <CODE> sendmail -q </CODE> running for each domain to
queue up undelivered mail. The new sendmail.init file:
<P>

<H3>Inetd Setup</H3>

<P>Pop should install normally with no extra effort.  It will
just need the inetd entry for it with the virtuald part added.
The inetd.conf entries for sendmail and pop:
<P>
<PRE>
pop-3 stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/bin/virtuald \
        virtuald /virtual/conf.pop in.qpop -s 
smtp stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/bin/virtuald \
        virtuald /virtual/conf.mail sendmail -bs

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Qmail Solution</A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>This solution takes over the delivery responsibilities of qmail-local, so
use of the .qmail files in the virtual home directories will not work.  However,
each domain will still get a domain master user that will control aliasing for 
the whole domain.  Two external programs will be used for that domain masters
.qmail-default file.  The mail will be passed through these two programs in
order to deliver mail for each domain. 
<P>
<P>Two programs are required since one of them is run setuid root.  It is a small
program that changes to a non-root user and then runs the second program.  Consult
your nearest security related site for a discussion as to why this is necessary.
<P>
<P>This solution bypasses the need for using virtuald.  Qmail is flexible enough
to not require a general virtuald setup.  Qmail's design utilizes the chaining of
programs together to deliver mail.  This design makes it very easy to insert the virtual
section into the Qmail delivery process without altering a stock install of Qmail.
<P>
<P>A note that since you are using one Qmail any unqualified domain name will be
expanded with the domain of the main server.  This is because you do not
have a separate Qmail server for each domain.  Therefore, make sure that your client 
(Eudora, elm, mutt, etc.) knows to expand all of your unqualified domain names.
<P>
<H3>Setup Virtual Domains</H3>

<P>Qmail has to be configured to accept mail for each of the virtual domains
you will be serving.  Type the following commands.
<P>
<PRE>
echo "domain1.com:domain1" &gt;&gt; /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Setup Domain Master User</H3>

<P>Add to your main /etc/passwd file the user domain1.  I would make the shell
/bin/false so that the domain master cannot log in.   That user will be
able to add .qmail files and all mail for domain1 will route through that
account.  Note that usernames can only be eight characters long and domain
names can be longer.  The remaining characters are truncated.  That means
that user domain12 and domain123 are going to be the same user and Qmail
might get confused.  So be careful in your master domain user naming
convention.
<P>
<P>Create the domain master's .qmail files with the following commands.  Add
any other system aliases at this point.  For example, webmaster or hostmaster.
<P>
<PRE>
echo "user@domain1.com" &gt; /home/d/domain1/.qmail-mailer-daemon
echo "user@domain1.com" &gt; /home/d/domain1/.qmail-postmaster
echo "user@domain1.com" &gt; /home/d/domain1/.qmail-root
</PRE>
<P>Create the domain master's .qmail-default file.  This will filter all mail
to the virtual domain.
<P>
<PRE>
echo "| /usr/local/bin/virtmailfilter" &gt; /home/d/domain1/.qmail-default
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Tcpserver</H3>

<P>Qmail requires a special pop that can support the Maildir 
format.  The pop program has to be virtualized.  The author
of Qmail recommends using tcpserver (an inetd replacement) with
Qmail so my examples use tcpserver and NOT inetd.
<P>
<P>Tcpserver does not require a config file.  All the information can be passed 
to it via the command line.  Here is the tcpserver.init file that you would use
for the mail daemon and popper:
<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
