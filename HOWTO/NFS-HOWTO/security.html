   may help you get an idea of the security problems with NFS. This is not

   there are relatively few networks in this situation so we would suggest 
   reading this section thoroughly for anyone setting up NFS.
 </P
><P
>   With NFS, there are two steps required for a client to gain access to 
   a file contained in a remote directory on the server. The first step is mount
   access. Mount access is achieved by the client machine attempting to 
   attach to the server. The security for this is provided by the 
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/exports</TT
> file. This file lists the names or IP addresses for machines
   that are allowed to access a share point. If the client's ip address 
   matches one of the entries in the access list then it will be allowed to
   mount. This is not terribly secure. If someone is capable of spoofing or
   taking over a trusted address then they can access your mount points. To
   give a real-world example of this type of "authentication": This is 
   equivalent to someone introducing themselves to you and you believing they
   are who they claim to be because they are wearing a sticker that says
   "Hello, My Name is ...."  Once the machine has mounted a volume, its
   operating system will have access to all files on the volume (with the
   possible exception of those owned by root; see below) and write access
   to those files as well, if the volume was exported with the 
   <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>rw</B
></TT
> option.
 </P
><P
>   The second step is file access. This is a function of normal file system
   access controls on the client and not a specialized function of NFS. 
   Once the drive is mounted the user and group permissions on the files
   determine access control. 
 </P
><P
>   An example: bob on the server maps to the UserID 9999. Bob
   makes a file on the server that is only accessible the user 
   (the equivalent to typing 
   <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>chmod 600</B
></TT
> <EM
>filename</EM
>).
   A client is allowed to mount the drive where the file is stored.
   On the client mary maps to UserID 9999. This means that the client
   user mary can access bob's file that is marked as only accessible by him.
   It gets worse: If someone has become superuser on the client machine they can
   <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>su - </B
> <EM
>username</EM
> 
   and become <EM
>any</EM

    The portmapper is not in as bad a shape as a few years ago but it is
    still a point of worry for many sys admins.  The portmapper, like NFS and
    NIS, should not really have connections made to it outside of a trusted
    local area network. If you have to expose them to the outside world - 
    be careful and keep up diligent monitoring of those systems.

    The easy way to check if your portmapper is good or not is to run 
    <EM
>strings(1)</EM

CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts.deny</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts.allow</TT

CLASS="FILENAME"
>/sbin/portmap</TT

    check it with this command:

  </P
><P
>    Closing the portmapper for everyone is a bit drastic, so we open it
    again by editing <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

    we need to figure out what to put in it.  It should basically list 
    all machines that should  have access to your portmapper.  On a run of 
    the mill Linux system there are very few machines that need any access 
    for any reason.  The portmapper administers <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nfsd</B
>, 
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mountd</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ypbind</B
>/<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ypserv</B
>,
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rquotad</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockd</B
> (which shows up
    as <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>nlockmgr</TT
>), <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>statd</B
>
    (which shows up as <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>status</TT
>) 
    and 'r' services like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ruptime</B
> 
    and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rusers</B
>.
    Of these only <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nfsd</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mountd</B
>, 
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ypbind</B
>/<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ypserv</B
> and perhaps 
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rquotad</B
>,<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockd</B
> 
    and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>statd</B
> are of any consequence.  All machines that need 
    to access services on your machine should be allowed to do that.  Let's 
    say that your machine's address is <EM
>192.168.0.254</EM
> and 
    that it lives on the subnet <EM
>192.168.0.0</EM
>, and that all 
    machines on the subnet should have access to it (for an overview of those
    terms see the the <A

 to breifly review how they bind to ports.</P
><P
>When a daemon starts up, it requests a free port from the portmapper. 
The portmapper gets the port for the daemon and keeps track of 
the port currently used by that daemon. When other hosts or processes
need to communicate with the daemon, they request the port number
from the portmapper in order to find the
daemon. So the ports will perpetually float because different ports may 
be free at different times and so the portmapper will allocate them 
differently each time. This is a pain for setting up a firewall. If 
you never know where the daemons are going to be then you don't 
know precisely which ports to allow access to. This might not be a big deal 
for many people running on a protected or isolated LAN. For those 
people on a public network, though, this is horrible.</P
><P
>In kernels 2.4.13 and later with nfs-utils 0.3.3 or later you no 
longer have to worry about the floating of ports in the portmapper. 
Now all of the daemons pertaining to nfs can be "pinned" to a port. 
Most of them nicely take a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-p</B
> option when they are started;
those daemons that are started by the kernel take some kernel arguments 
or module options. They are described below.</P
><P
>Some of the daemons involved in sharing data via nfs are already 
bound to a port. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>portmap</B
> is always on port 
111 tcp and udp. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nfsd</B
> is 
always on port 2049 TCP and UDP (however, as of kernel 2.4.17, NFS over
TCP is considered experimental and is not for use on production machines).</P

CLASS="COMMAND"

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

In theory no packet will pass through until it is reassembled,

is passed. Of course there are attacks that can be generated 
by overloading a machine with packet fragments. But NFS won't 
work correctly unless you let fragments through. See <A

>The above command causes <B

any request directed at the client's port 250 and forward it, 
first through <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sshd</B
> on the server, and then on
 to the server's port 2049.  The second line
causes a similar type of forwarding between requests to port 251 on
the client and port 32767 on the server.  The 
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>localhost</B
></TT
> is relative to the server; that is,
the forwarding will be done to the server itself.  The port could otherwise
have been made to forward to any other machine, and the requests would look to
the outside world as if they were coming from the server.  Thus, the requests
will appear to NFSD on the server as if they are coming from the server itself. 
Note that in order to bind to a port below 1024 on the client, we have 
to run this command as root on the client.  Doing this will be necessary 
if we have exported our filesystem with the default 
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>secure</B
></TT
> option.</P
><P
>Finally, we are pulling a little trick with the last option,
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B

we use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>, even with the <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>-L</B

> option,
we will open up a shell on the remote machine.  But instead, we just want
the port forwarding to execute in the background so that we get our shell
on the client back.  So, we tell <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> to execute a command
in the background on the server to sleep for 60 minutes.  This will cause
the port to be forwarded for 60 minutes until it gets a connection; at that
point, the port will continue to be forwarded until the connection dies or
until the 60 minutes are up, whichever happens later.  The above command
could be put in our startup scripts on the client, right after the network
is started.</P
><P
>  Next, we have to mount the filesystem on the client.  To do this, we tell
  the client to mount a filesystem on the localhost, but at a different
  port from the usual 2049.  Specifically, an entry in <TT

2049 and 32767 on the server.  Thus, any ordinary user on the server can
mount our filesystems with the same rights as root on our client.</P

>If you are using an NFS server that does not have a way for ordinary users

First, the connection travels from the client to the server via
<B

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

you do not need to leave the other ports, such as 2049 and 32767, open
anymore.  Second, file locking will no longer work.  It is not possible
to ask <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>statd</B

to a particular port for a particular mount; therefore, any locking requests
will cause <B
