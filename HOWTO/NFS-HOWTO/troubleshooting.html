       There are several ways of doing this.  The most reliable
       way is to look at the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/mounts</TT
>, 
       which will list all mounted filesystems and give details about them.  If
       this doesn't work (for example if you don't 
       have the <TT

>/proc</TT

       filesystem compiled into your kernel), you can type 
       <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B

></TT

     </P
><P
>       If the file system appears to be mounted, then you may
       have mounted another file system on top of it (in which
       case you should unmount and remount both volumes), or you 
       may have exported the file system on the server before you 
       mounted it there, in which case NFS is exporting the underlying 
       mount point (if so then you need to restart NFS on the 
       server).

             are not, then you have not re-exported properly.  If they
             are listed, make sure the server recognizes your
             client as being the machine you think it is.  For
             example, you may have an old listing for the client

             Finally, try to ping the client from the server, and try

            This says that we have NFS versions 2 and 3, rpc.statd 
            version 1, network lock manager (the service name for 
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpc.lockd</B

            There are also different
            service listings depending on whether NFS is travelling over 
            TCP or UDP.  UDP is usually (but not always) the default 
            unless TCP is explicitly requested.

            for helpful messages: Authentication errors from bad

            help you figure out how your logs are
            set up.  Finally, some older operating systems may
            behave badly when routes between the two machines
            are asymmetric.  Try typing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tracepath [server]</B
> from
            the client and see if the word "asymmetric" shows up
            anywhere in the output.  If it does then this may
            be causing packet loss.  However asymmetric routes are
            not usually a problem on recent linux distributions.

      It will happen if you have ipchains on at the server and/or the

      chains.  Allow fragments from the remote host and you'll be able

>     If a file has been modified within one second of its 
     previous modification and left the same size, it will 
     continue to generate the same inode number.  Because
     of this, constant reads and writes to a file by
     multiple clients may cause file corruption.  Fixing
     this bug requires changes deep within the filesystem
     layer, and therefore it is a 2.5 item.
