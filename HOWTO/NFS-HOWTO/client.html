>    Before beginning, you should double-check to make sure your mount 
    program is new enough (version 2.10m if you want to use Version 3 
    NFS), and that the client machine supports NFS mounting, though most
    standard distributions do.  If you are using a 2.2 or later kernel 
    with the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> filesystem you can check the latter by reading the 
    file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/filesystems</TT
> and making sure there is a line containing 
    nfs.  If not, typing <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>insmod nfs</B
></TT
> may make it
    magically appear if NFS has been compiled as a module; otherwise,
    you will need to build (or download) a kernel that has 
    NFS support built in.  In general, kernels that do not have NFS
    compiled in will give a very specific error when the 
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
> command below is run.
  </P
><P
>    To begin using machine as an NFS client, you will need the portmapper 
    running on that machine, and to use NFS file locking, you will
    also need <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpc.statd</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpc.lockd</B
>
    running on both the client and the server.  Most recent distributions 
    start those services by default at boot time; if yours doesn't, see 
    <A
HREF="server.html#CONFIG"
>Section 3.2</A
> for information on how to start them up.
  </P
><P
>    With <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>portmap</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lockd</B
>, 
    and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>statd</B
> running, you should now be able to 
    mount the remote directory from your server just the way you mount 
    a local hard drive, with the mount command.  Continuing our example 
    from the previous section, suppose our server above is called 
    <EM
>master.foo.com</EM
>,and we want to mount the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
> directory on 
    <EM
>slave1.foo.com</EM
>.  Then, all we have to do, from the root prompt on 
    <EM
>slave1.foo.com</EM
>, is type:
  <TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>   # mount master.foo.com:/home /mnt/home
  </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
  and the directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
> on master will appear as the directory 
  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/home</TT
> on <EM
>slave1</EM
>.  (Note that
  this assumes we have created the directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/home</TT
> 
  as an empty mount point beforehand.)
 </P
><P
>   If this does not work, see the Troubleshooting section (<A
HREF="troubleshooting.html"
>Section 7</A

   local file systems can, so that they mount when your system starts
   up.  The only difference is that the file system type will be
   set to <TT

><B

   have to be set to zero.  So for our example above, the entry in

   amd or autofs, the options in the corresponding fields of your mount 
   listings should look very similar if not identical.

>     There are some options you should consider adding at once.  They
     govern the way the NFS client handles a server crash or network
     outage.  One of the cool things about NFS is that it can handle this
     gracefully.  If you set up the clients right.  There are two distinct
     failure modes:

>   If a file request fails, the NFS client will report an 
   error to the process on the client machine requesting the file 
   access.  Some programs can handle this with composure, most 
   won't.  We do not recommend using this setting; it is a recipe 
   for corrupted files and lost data.  You should especially not 
   use this for mail disks --- if you value your mail, that is.

     will hang when the server crashes.  The process cannot be 
     interrupted or killed (except by a "sure kill") unless you also 
     specify <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"

>intr</B

     NFS server is back online the program will
     continue undisturbed from where it was.  We recommend using

  well on all or most setups.  On the one hand, some combinations of

  handle blocks that large. On the other hand, if they can handle 
  larger blocks, a bigger size might be faster.
