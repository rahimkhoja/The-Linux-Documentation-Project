>    It is assumed that you will be setting up both a server and a
    client.  If you are just setting up a client to work off of
    somebody else's server (say in your department), you can skip
    to <A
HREF="client.html"
>Section 4</A
>.  However, every client that is set up requires
    modifications on the server to authorize that client (unless 
    the server setup is done in a very insecure way), so even if you
    are not setting up a server you may wish to read this section to
    get an idea what kinds of authorization problems to look out for.
 </P

    configuration files for NFS, and then starting the NFS services.

   <TT

   Strictly speaking, you only need to edit <TT

   NFS to work, but you would be left with an extremely insecure setup. You may also need 
   to edit your startup scripts; see <A

>  If you have a large installation, you may find that you have a bunch 
  of computers all on the same local network that require access to 
  your server.  There are a few ways of simplifying references
  to large numbers of machines.  First, you can give access to a range 
  of machines at once by specifying a network and a netmask.  For 
  example, if you wanted to allow access to all the machines with IP 
  addresses between <EM
>192.168.0.0</EM
> and
<EM
>192.168.0.255</EM
> then you could have the entries:

HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html"

  for further information about how netmasks work, and you may also wish to 
  look at the man pages for <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>init</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hosts.allow</TT
>.</P
><P
>  Second, you can use NIS netgroups in your entry. To specify a
  netgroup in your exports file, simply prepend the name of the
  netgroup with an "@".  See the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/NIS-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>NIS HOWTO</A
>
  for details on how netgroups work. </P
><P
>  Third, you can use wildcards such as <EM
>*.foo.com</EM
> or
 <EM
>192.168.</EM
> instead of hostnames.  There were problems
  with wildcard implementation in the 2.2 kernel series that were fixed
  in kernel 2.2.19.</P
><P
>  However, you should keep in mind that any of these simplifications
  could cause a security risk if there are machines in your netgroup
  or local network that you do not trust completely.</P
><P
>  A few cautions are in order about what cannot (or should not) be
  exported.  First, if a directory is exported, its parent and child
  directories cannot be exported if they are in the same filesystem.
  However, exporting both should not be necessary because listing the
  parent directory in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/exports</TT
> file will cause all underlying
  directories within that file system to be exported.  </P
><P
>  Second, it is a poor idea to export a FAT or VFAT (i.e., MS-DOS or 
  Windows 95/98) filesystem with NFS.  FAT is not designed for use on a 
  multi-user machine, and as a result, operations that depend on 
  permissions will not work well.  Moreover, some of the underlying 
  filesystem design is reported to work poorly with NFS's expectations.  </P
><P
>  Third, device or other special files may not export correctly to non-Linux 
  clients.  See <A

>   These two files specify which computers on the network can use 
   services on your machine.  Each line of the file 
   contains a single entry listing 
   a service and a set of machines.  When the server gets a request 
   from a machine, it does the following:
  <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>     It first checks <TT

 </P
><P
>   In addition to controlling access to services 
   handled by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inetd</B
> (such 
   as telnet and FTP), this file can also control access to NFS
   by restricting connections to the daemons that provide NFS services.
   Restrictions are done on a per-service basis.
 </P
><P
>   The first daemon to restrict access to is the portmapper.  This daemon
   essentially just tells requesting clients how to find all the NFS
   services on the system.  Restricting access to the portmapper is the
   best defense against someone breaking into your system through NFS
   because completely unauthorized clients won't know where to find the
   NFS daemons.  However, there are two things to watch out for.  First,
   restricting portmapper isn't enough if the intruder already knows
   for some reason how to find those daemons.  And second, if you are
   running NIS, restricting portmapper will also restrict requests to NIS.
   That should usually be harmless since you usually want
   to restrict NFS and NIS in a similar way, but just be cautioned.
   (Running NIS is generally a good idea if you are running NFS, because
   the client machines need a way of knowing who owns what files on the
   exported volumes.  Of course there are other ways of doing this such
   as syncing password files.  See the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/NIS-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>NIS HOWTO</A
> for information on
   setting up NIS.)
 </P
><P
>   In general it is a good idea with NFS (as with most internet services)
   to explicitly deny access to IP addresses that you don't need
   to allow access to.
 </P
><P
>   The first step in doing this is to add the followng entry to 
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts.deny</TT

   If you have a newer version of <SPAN

   network lock manager (the service name for rpc.lockd) versions 1, 3, 
   and 4.  There are also different service listings depending on 
   whether NFS is travelling over TCP or UDP.  Linux systems use UDP
   by default unless TCP is explicitly requested; however other OSes 
   such as Solaris default to TCP.
