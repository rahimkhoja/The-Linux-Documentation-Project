NAME="DEDICATION">1.5. Dedication</H2
><P
>NFS on Linux was made possible by a collaborative effort of many 
people, but a few stand out for special recognition.  The original
version was developed by Olaf Kirch and Alan Cox.  The version 3 
server code was solidified by Neil Brown, based on work from
Saadia Khan, James Yarbrough, Allen Morris, H.J. Lu, and others
(including himself).  The client code was written by Olaf Kirch and 
updated by Trond Myklebust.  The version 4 lock manager was developed 
by Saadia Khan.  Dave Higgen and H.J. Lu both have undertaken the
thankless job of extensive maintenance and bug fixes to get the 
code to actually work the way it was supposed to.  H.J. has also
done extensive development of the nfs-utils package.  Of course this 
dedication is leaving many people out.</P

>The original version of this document was developed by Nicolai 
Langfeldt.  It was heavily rewritten in 2000 by Tavis Barr
and Seth Vidal to reflect substantial changes in the workings
of NFS for Linux developed between the 2.0 and 2.4 kernels.
It was edited again in February 2002, when Tom McNeal made substantial
additions to the performance section.
Thomas Emmel, Neil Brown, Trond Myklebust, Erez Zadok, and Ion Badulescu
also provided valuable comments and contributions.</P
