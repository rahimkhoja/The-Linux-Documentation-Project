>Careful analysis of your environment, both from the client and from the server
point of view, is the first step necessary for optimal NFS performance. The
first sections will address issues that are generally important to the client.
Later (<A

will be discussed. In both
cases, these issues will not be limited exclusively to one side or the other,
but it is useful to separate the two in order to get a clearer picture of
cause and effect.</P
><P
>Aside from the general network configuration - appropriate network capacity,
faster NICs, full duplex settings in order to reduce collisions, agreement in
network speed among the switches and hubs, etc. - one of the most important
client optimization settings are the NFS data transfer buffer sizes, specified

the default varies by which version of NFS we
are using. The most common default is 4K (4096 bytes), although for TCP-based
mounts in 2.2 kernels, and for all mounts beginning with 2.4 kernels, the
server specifies the default block size.</P
><P
>The theoretical limit for the NFS V2 protocol is 8K. For the V3 protocol, the
limit is specific to the server. On the Linux server, the maximum block size
is defined by the value of the kernel constant 
<TT

><B
>NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE</B
></TT
>, found in the
Linux kernel source file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>./include/linux/nfsd/const.h</TT
>.
The current maximum block size for the kernel, as of 2.4.17, is 8K (8192 bytes),
but the patch set implementing NFS over TCP/IP transport in the 2.4 
series, as of this writing, uses a value of 32K (defined in the
patch as 32*1024) for the maximum block size.</P
><P
>All 2.4 clients currently support up to 32K block transfer sizes, allowing the
standard 32K block transfers across NFS mounts from other servers, such as
Solaris, without client modification.</P
><P
>The defaults may be too big or too small, depending on the specific
combination of hardware and kernels. On the one hand, some combinations of
Linux kernels and network cards (largely on older machines) cannot handle
blocks that large. On the other hand, if they can handle larger blocks, a
bigger size might be faster.</P

><P
>Then unmount, and mount again with a larger and smaller block size. They
should be multiples of 1024, and not larger than the maximum block size
allowed by your system. Note that NFS Version 2 is limited to a maximum of 8K,
regardless of the maximum block size defined by 
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE</B
></TT
>; Version 3
will support up to 64K, if permitted. The block size should be a power of two
since most of the parameters that would constrain it (such as file system
block sizes and network packet size) are also powers of two. However, some
users have reported better successes with block sizes that are not powers of
two but are still multiples of the file system block size and the network
packet size.</P
><P
>Directly after mounting with a larger size, cd into the mounted
file system and do things like <B

transactions, the most important statistic is the number of retransmissions,

timeouts, etc. This will have a tremendously important effect on NFS
performance, and should be carefully monitored. 
Note that <B

><P
>To correct network problems, you may wish to reconfigure the packet size that
your network card uses. Very often there is a constraint somewhere else in the
network (such as a router) that causes a smaller maximum packet size between
two machines than what the network cards on the machines are actually capable
of. TCP should autodiscover the appropriate packet size for a network, but UDP
will simply stay at a default value. So determining the appropriate packet
size is especially important if you are using NFS over UDP.</P

larger than your network's MTU (often set to 1500, in
many networks) will cause IP packet fragmentation when using NFS over UDP. IP
packet fragmentation and reassembly require a significant amount of CPU
resource at both ends of a network connection. In addition, packet
fragmentation also exposes your network traffic to greater unreliability,
since a complete RPC request must be retransmitted if a UDP packet fragment is
dropped for any reason. Any increase of RPC retransmissions, along with the
possibility of increased timeouts, are the single worst impediment to
performance for NFS over UDP.</P
><P
>Packets may be dropped for many reasons. If your network topography is
complex, fragment routes may differ, and may not all arrive at the Server for
reassembly. NFS Server capacity may also be an issue, since the kernel has a
limit of how many fragments it can buffer before it starts throwing away
packets. With kernels that support the <TT

NAME="NFS-TCP">5.4. NFS over TCP</H2
><P
>A new feature, available for both 2.4 and 2.5 kernels but not yet
integrated into the mainstream kernel at the time of 
this writing, is NFS over TCP. Using TCP
has a distinct advantage and a distinct disadvantage over UDP.  The advantage
is that it works far better than UDP on lossy networks.
When using TCP, a single dropped packet can be retransmitted, without
the retransmission of the entire RPC request, resulting in better performance
on lossy networks. In addition, TCP will handle network speed differences
better than UDP, due to the underlying flow control at the network level. </P
><P
>The disadvantage of using TCP is that it is not a stateless protocol like
UDP.  If your server crashes in the middle of a packet transmission,
the client will hang and any shares will need to be unmounted and remounted.</P
><P
>The overhead incurred by the TCP protocol will result in
somewhat slower performance than UDP under ideal network
conditions, but the cost is not severe, and is often not
noticable without careful measurement. If you are using 
gigabit ethernet from end to end, you might also investigate the
usage of jumbo frames, since the high speed network may
allow the larger frame sizes without encountering increased 
collision rates, particularly if you have set the network 
to full duplex.</P

><P
>If network cards auto-negotiate badly with hubs and switches, and ports run at
different speeds, or with different duplex configurations, performance will be
severely impacted due to excessive collisions, dropped packets, etc. If you
see excessive numbers of dropped packets in the 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nfsstat</B
> output, or poor
network performance in general, try playing around with the network speed and
duplex settings. If possible, concentrate on establishing a 100BaseT full
duplex subnet; the virtual elimination of collisions in full duplex will
remove the most severe performance inhibitor for NFS over UDP.  Be careful
when turning off autonegotiation on a card: The hub or switch that the card
is attached to will then resort to other mechanisms (such as parallel detection)
to determine the duplex settings, and some cards default to half duplex
because it is more likely to be supported by an old hub.  The best solution, 
if the driver supports it, is to force the card to negotiate 100BaseT 
full duplex.</P

versions prior to Version 1.11 (the latter is in the CVS tree,

"asynchronous". This default permits the server to reply to client requests as
soon as it has processed the request and handed it off to the local file
system, without waiting for the data to be written to stable storage. This is
indicated by the <TT

better performance at the cost of possible data corruption if the server
reboots while still holding unwritten data and/or metadata in its caches. This
possible data corruption is not detectable at the time of occurrence, since
the <TT

CLASS="USERINPUT"

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

to these results, are as follows:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>NFS_UNSTABLE - Data/Metadata was not committed to stable storage on the
server, and must be cached on the client until a subsequent client commit
request assures that the server does send data to stable storage.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>NFS_DATA_SYNC - Metadata was not sent to stable storage, and must be cached
on the client. A subsequent commit is necessary, as is required above.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>NFS_FILE_SYNC - No data/metadata need be cached, and a subsequent commit
need not be sent for the range covered by this request.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>In addition to the above definition of synchronous behavior, the client may
explicitly insist on total synchronous behavior, regardless of the protocol,
by opening all files with the <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>O_SYNC</B
></TT
> option. In this case, all replies to
client requests will wait until the data has hit the server's disk, regardless
of the protocol used (meaning that, in NFS version 3, all requests will be
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>NFS_FILE_SYNC</B
></TT
> requests, and will require that the Server returns this status).
In that case, the performance of NFS Version 2 and NFS Version 3 will be
virtually identical.</P
><P
>If, however, the old default <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>async</B
></TT
> 
behavior is used, the <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>O_SYNC</B
></TT
> option has
no effect at all in either version of NFS, since the server will reply to the
client without waiting for the write to complete. In that case the performance
differences between versions will also disappear.</P
><P
>Finally, note that, for NFS version 3 protocol requests, a subsequent commit
request from the NFS client at file close time, or at <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fsync()</B
> time, will force
the server to write any previously unwritten data/metadata to the disk, and
the server will not reply to the client until this has been completed, as long
as <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>sync</B
></TT
> behavior is followed. If <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>async</B
></TT
> is used, the commit is essentially
a no-op, since the server once again lies to the client, telling the client that
the data has been sent to stable storage. This again exposes the client and
server to data corruption, since cached data may be discarded on the client
due to its belief that the server now has the data maintained in stable
storage.</P

<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/jfs/"

>ext3</A
> will work correctly with NFS
version 3. In addition, Reiserfs version 3.6 will work with NFS version 3 on
2.4.7 or later kernels (patches are available for previous kernels). Earlier versions
of Reiserfs did not include room for generation numbers in the inode, exposing
the possibility of undetected data corruption during a server reboot.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Additionally, journalled file systems can be configured to maximize
performance by taking advantage of the fact that journal updates are all that
is necessary for data protection. One example is using ext3 with <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>data=journal</B
></TT
>
so that all updates go first to the journal, and later to the main file
system. Once the journal has been updated, the NFS server can safely issue the
reply to the clients, and the main file system update can occur at the
server's leisure.</P
><P
>The journal in a journalling file system may also reside on a separate device
such as a flash memory card so that journal updates normally require no seeking. With only rotational
delay imposing a cost, this gives reasonably good synchronous IO performance.
Note that ext3 currently supports journal relocation, and ReiserFS will
(officially) support it soon. The Reiserfs tool package found at <A

contains
the <B

require a kernel patch which has not yet been officially released as of
