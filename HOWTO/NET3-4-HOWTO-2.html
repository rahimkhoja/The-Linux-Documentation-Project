<P>The original NET-FAQ was written by Matt Welsh and Terry Dawson to
answer frequently asked questions about networking for Linux at a time
before the Linux Documentation Project had formally started. It
covered the very early development versions of the Linux Networking
Kernel. The NET-2-HOWTO superceded the NET-FAQ and was one of the
original LDP HOWTO documents, it covered what was called version 2 and
later version 3 of the Linux kernel Networking software. This document
in turn supercedes it and relates only to version 4 of the Linux
Networking Kernel or more specifically kernel releases 2.x and 2.2.x.
<P>Previous versions of this document became quite large because of
the enormous amount of material that fell within its scope. To help
reduce this problem a number of HOWTO's dealing with specific
networking topics have been produced. This document will provide
pointers to them where relevant and cover those areas not yet covered
by other documents.
