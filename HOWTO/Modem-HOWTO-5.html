<P>Since each modem has an associated serial port and the port has both
hardware and software, there are three parts to configuring a modem:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Locate the serial port hardware: IO address, IRQ; Done by PnP
methods or jumpers, setserial.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-6.html#locate_port">Locating  the Serial Port: IO address IRQs</A> 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#set_serial">What is  Setserial</A></LI>
<LI> Configure the serial port driver (high-level): Done by the
communication program (stty-like).  Sets speed, flow control, etc.
See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-7.html#config_stty">Configuring the Serial Driver  (high-level)</A> See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-7.html#stty_">What is stty ?</A></LI>
<LI> Configure the modem itself: Done by the communication program
See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-8.html#modem_conf">Modem Configuration</A></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The above omits a few other things that "setserial" can do besides
locating the serial ports.  But normally you don't need to use them.
Setserial may be used in the future to enable super-high speed.</P>
<P>Communication programs include <CODE>minicom</CODE>, <CODE>seyon</CODE>, or
<CODE>wvdial</CODE> (for PPP) and <CODE>mgetty</CODE> for dial-in.  Such
communication programs require that you configure them, although the
default configuration they come with may only need a little tweaking.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the communication program doesn't locate the serial
port.  This "locating" is the low-level PnP configuring of the serial
port: setting its IO address and IRQ in both the hardware and the
driver.  If you are lucky, this will happen automatically when you
boot Linux.  Setting these in the hardware was formerly done by
jumpers and then running "setserial" but today it's done by
"Plug-and-Play" software.  You may still need "setserial".  So if
Linux (or the wvdial program, etc.) doesn't report what serial port
your modem is on, then you can try to find it yourself per the next
section but it may not be easy.</P>
