    But most important, I want to  emphasize again that for Debian 
maintainers,
packages are source packages, not binary packages. They never interact directly
with the internals binary packages. In fact only '<TT
CLASS="literal"
>dpkg-deb</TT
>' and '<TT
CLASS="literal"
>dpkg</TT
>' developers
need to know what they are.  In fact it is not recommended to do so.
</P

>&#13;
If a developer were to explain someone how to build a Debian package, he
will certainly explain how to make a source package and how to build it.




</P
><P
>&#13;On the other hand, not every developer wants to submit his software 
to Debian (yet), but still wants to profit from 
the advantages a packaging system like 'dpkg' offers without releasing
package source code. Personally I will release my freeware projects 
still as tar.gz files with source code etc. for all kind of platforms, 
while I plan to offer more and more '.deb' packages for the convenience 
of Debian users who just want to install and use my software.

If someone wants to do the next step to submit a software package to Debian,
you have to move on to study the Debian New Maintainers' Guide as well
as the <A

>Debian Policy Manual</A
>
first. On your undertaking to create a Debian source package, also have 
a look at the 
<A
HREF="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/"
TARGET="_top"
>debian-mentors</A
>
mailing list to see experienced and
beginning Debian developers interacting with each other and tackling similar
problem you might encounter.
