<H2><A NAME="s4">4. <I>initrd</I> Cookbook for root mounted RAID</A></H2>

<P>This is the procedure to make an 'initrd' ramdisk with rescue tools for raid.
<P>Specifically, this document referrs to RAID1 and RAID5 implementations.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Security Reminder</A>
</H2>

<P>The rescue file system may be used stand alone. Should your raid array 
fail to mount, you are left with the rescue system mounted and running. 
TAKE THE APPROPRIATE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS!!!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Build the Kernel and Raid Tools</A>
</H2>

<P>The first thing that must be done is to patch and build your kernel
and become familiar with the raid tools. Make sure and include 
<A HREF="Root-RAID-HOWTO-12.html#Appendix-E">Gadi's raid stop patch</A> in Appendix E.
Configure, mount and test your raid device(s). The details of how to do this
are included in the <B>raidtools</B> package and briefly reviewed later in
this document.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Build the <I>initrd</I> Rescue and Boot filesystem</A>
</H2>

<P>I used the <B>Slackware-3.4</B> distribution to build both the Rescue/Boot
filesystem and the filesystem for the production machine. Any linux
distribution should work fine. If you use a different distribution, review
the Slackware specific portion of this procedure and modify it to suit your needs.
<P>
<P>I use loadlin to boot the kernel image and ramdisk from a dos partition
simply because there are oddball devices in my system that have dos
configuration software. Lilo will work just as well and a small linux
partition can be used instead containing only the raid/boot files and the
<B>lilo</B> record.
<P>For the raid boot/rescue system, 
I chose to create a minimum ramdisk system using the Slackware 'setup' 
script followed by installing the 'linuxthreads' package and 'raidtools'
over the clean Slackware installation on my ramdisk. I used the
<I><B>identical</B></I> procedure to build the production system. So the
rescue and production systems are very similar.
<P>This installation process gives me a 'bare' system 
(save a copy of the file) to which I overlay
<P>
<PRE>
        /lib/modules/2.x.x......
        /etc .... with a modified fstab, mdtab, raidX.conf, raidboot.conf
        /etc/rc.d
        /dev/md*
</PRE>
<P>from my current system to customize it for the particular kernel
and machine that it is/will-be running on.
<P>This makes the boot/rescue system the same system that is running
on the root mounted raid device, just skinnyed down a bit, while 
allowing the library, etc... revisions to always be current.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Start the STEP by STEP instructions</A>
</H2>

<P>From the root home directory (/root):
<P>
<PRE>
        cd /root
        mkdir raidboot
        cd raidboot
</PRE>
<P>Create a mountpoints to work on
<P>
<PRE>
        mkdir mnt
        mkdir mnt2
</PRE>
<P>
<P>Make a file large enough to do the file system install. This
will be a lot larger than the final rescue file system. 
I chose 24 megs since 16 megs is not large enough 
<PRE>
        dd if=/dev/zero of=build bs=1024k count=24
</PRE>

associate the file with a loop device
and generate an ext2 file system on the file
<P>
<PRE>
        losetup /dev/loop0 build
        mke2fs -v -m0 -L initrd /dev/loop0
        mount /dev/loop0 mnt
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Install the distribution - Slackware Specific</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="#threads">...skip Slackware Specific stuff</A>
and go to next section.
<P>Now that an empty filesystem is created and mounted, run "setup".
<P>
<PRE>
Specify         /root/raidboot/mnt
</PRE>
<P>as the <B>'target'</B>.  The source is whatever you normally install from.
Select the packages you wish to install and proceed but <B>DO NOT</B> configure.
<P>Choose 'EXPERT' prompting mode.
<P>I chose 'A', 'AP, and 'N' installing only the minimum to run the system 
plus an editor I am familiar with (vi, jed, joe) that is reasonably compact.

From the 'N' package I only loaded TCPIP.  This isn't really necessary, 
but is very handy and allows access to the network while working on a 
repair or update with the root raid array dismounted. TCPIP also 
contains 'biff' which is used by some of the applications in 'A'. If 
you don't install 'N' you might want to install the biff package anyway.

    WARNING:    The above procedure moves your password and shadow
                files onto the rescue disk!!!!!

    WARNING:    You may not wish to do this for security reasons.
</PRE>

Create any directories for mounting /dev/disk... as may be required
that are unique to your system.  These are the mountpoints for booting
the system (boot partition and backup boot partition). My system boot from
dos using <B>loadlin</B>, however linux partition(s) and lilo will work fine.
My system uses:
<PRE>
        cd /root/raidboot/mnt           &lt;--- initrd root
        mkdir dosa                      dos partition mount point
        mkdir dosb                      dos mirror mount point
</PRE>

The rescue file system is complete!
<P>You will note upon examination of the files in the rescue file
system, that there are still many files that could be deleted.
I have not done this since it would overly complicate this 
procedure and most raid systems have adequate disk and memory.
If you wish to skinny down the file system, go to it!

<H2><A NAME="modify_shutdown"></A> <A NAME="ss4.12">4.12 Modifying the rc-scripts for SHUTDOWN </A>
</H2>

<P>To complete the installation, modify the rc scripts to save
the md status to the real root device when shutdown occurs.
<PRE>
In slackware this is rc.0 -> rc.6
In debian 'bo' this is in both 'halt' and 'reboot'

If you implement this in another distribution, please e-mail
the instructions and sample files so they can be included here.
</PRE>

I have modified Bohumil Chalupa's raid stop work-around slightly. His
original solution is presented in 
<A HREF="Root-RAID-HOWTO-8.html#Appendix-A">Appendix A</A>.
<P>Since there are no linux partitions left on the production system except
<B>md0</B>, the boot partitions are used to store the <B>raidOK readonly</B> status.
I chose to write a file to each of the duplicate boot partitions containing the
status of the md array at shutdown and signifying that the
md device has been remounted RO. This allows the system to be fail safe 
when any of the hard drives die.
<P>The shutdown script is modified to call 
<A HREF="Root-RAID-HOWTO-13.html#Appendix-F">rc.raidown</A> which saves the necessary
information to successfully reboot and mount the raid device. Examples of 
shutdown scripts for various linux distributions are shown in
<A HREF="Root-RAID-HOWTO-9.html#Appendix-B">Appendix B</A>.
<P>
<P>To capture the raid array shutdown status insert a call to
<A HREF="Root-RAID-HOWTO-13.html#Appendix-F">rc.raidown</A>
after any <B>case</B> statements (if present) but before the actual shutdown
(kills, status saves, etc...) begins and before the file systems are 
dismounted.

This will cleanly stop all raid devices except root.  Root status

<P>
<P>Copy the rc file to your new raid array, the rescue file system that is
still mounted on <B>/root/raidboot/mnt</B> and the development system 
if it is on the same machine. 
<P>Modify rescue <B>etc/fstab</B> as needed

be specified.
<UL>
<LI>Raid_Conf=msdos,/dev/sda1,raidboot
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This variable points to raid boot device and configuration file.
For floppy rescue boot, you may want to specify 
this on the kernel command line or in the loadlin or lilo boot file
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
format: <CODE>'filesystem-type,device,path-to-config-from-mountpoint'</CODE>

<LI>Raid_ALT=-r,-p5,/dev/md0,/dev/sda3 /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc3 /dev/sdd3
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Alternate mdadd parameters
necessary when booting with non-redundant raid array. These are the comma
separated command line parameters for <B>mdadd</B>. Unless they are needed to
start a failed/non-redundant array, COMMENT OUT OR SPECIFY WITH A 'NULL'.

Either of these parameters may be specified in the lilo or loadlin boot parameter
file or on the loadlin kernel command line. Care must be taken that the maximum 
line length is not exceeded, however, if the command line is used 
(128 characters).
<P>
<P>When booting with <B>lilo</B>, the parameters are included in the lilo config
file in the form:

append="Raid_Conf=msdos,/dev/sda1,raidboot"

</PRE>

See <B>man lilo.conf</B> for more detailed information.
<P>Since I have some hardware that requires DOS configuration utilities, I
have a small dos partition on the system.
Therefore, I used loadlin to boot the raid5 system from the dos
partition with a mirror (copy) on the companion disk. An identical method is
used for the raid1 system. The example below uses loadlin, but the procedure
is very similar for lilo.
<P>My dos root system contains a small editor among the utilities so I can modify
the boot parameters of loadlin if necessary, allowing me to reboot the
linux system on my swap disk while testing.
<P>The dos system contains this tree for linux"
