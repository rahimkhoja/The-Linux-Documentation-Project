<H2><A NAME="s8">8. News About Linux</A></H2>

<P> A monthly magazine, called <EM>Linux Journal</EM>, was launched over
four years ago.  It includes articles intended for almost all skill
levels, and is intended to be helpful to all Linux users.
One-year subscriptions are $22 in the U.S., $27
in Canada and Mexico, and $32 elsewhere, payable in US
currency.  Subscription inquiries can be sent via email to
subs@ssc.com, or faxed to +1-206-782-7191, or phoned to
+1-206-782-7733, or mailed to Linux Journal, PO Box 85867,
Seattle, WA 98145-1867 USA.  SSC has a PGP public key available
for encrypting your mail to protect your credit card number;
finger info@ssc.com to get the key.
<P>There are several Usenet newsgroups for Linux
discussion, and also several mailing lists.  See the Linux FAQ
for more information about the mailing lists (you should be able
to find the FAQ either in the newsgroup or on the FTP sites).
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce">news:comp.os.linux.announce</A> is a moderated newsgroup
for announcements about Linux (new programs, bug fixes, etc).
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.answers">news:comp.os.linux.answers</A> is a moderated newsgroup to
which the Linux FAQ, HOWTO documents, and other documentation
postings are made.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.admin">news:comp.os.linux.admin</A> is an unmoderated newsgroup for
discussion of administration of Linux systems.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.development.system">news:comp.os.linux.development.system</A> is an unmoderated newsgroup
specifically for discussion of Linux <B>kernel</B> development.  The
only application development questions that should be discussed here
are those that are intimately associated with the kernel.  All other
development questions are probably generic Unix development questions
and should be directed to a comp.unix group instead, unless
they are very Linux-specific applications questions, in which
case they should be directed at comp.os.linux.development.apps.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.development.apps">news:comp.os.linux.development.apps</A> is an unmoderated
newsgroup specifically for discussion of Linux-related
applications development.  It is not for discussion of where to
get applications for Linux, nor a discussion forum for those
who would like to see applications for Linux.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.hardware">news:comp.os.linux.hardware</A> is for Linux-specific
hardware questions.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.networking">news:comp.os.linux.networking</A> is for Linux-specific
networking development and setup questions.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.x">news:comp.os.linux.x</A> is for Linux-specific X Windows
questions.
<P>The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.misc">news:comp.os.linux.misc</A> is the replacement for comp.os.linux,
and is meant for any discussion that doesn't belong elsewhere.
<P>In general, <B>do not</B> crosspost between the Linux newsgroups.
The <B>only</B> crossposting that is appropriate is an occasional posting
between one unmoderated group and 
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce">news:comp.os.linux.announce</A>.
The whole point of splitting the old comp.os.linux group into many groups
is to reduce traffic in each group.  Those that do not follow this rule
will be flamed without mercy...
