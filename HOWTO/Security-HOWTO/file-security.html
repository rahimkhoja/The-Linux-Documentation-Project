SUID and SGID files on your system are a potential security risk, and
should be monitored closely.  Because these programs grant special
privileges to the user who is executing them, it is necessary to
ensure that insecure programs are not installed.  A favorite trick of
crackers is to exploit SUID-root programs, then leave a SUID
program as a back door to get in the next time, even if the original
hole is plugged.
</P

they are, so you are aware of any changes which could indicate a

>5.1. Umask Settings</H2
><P
>&#13;The <TT
CLASS="literal"
>umask</TT

mode on your system. It is the octal complement of the desired file
mode. If files are created without any regard to their permissions
settings, the user could inadvertently give read or write permission
to someone that should not have this permission. Typical <TT
CLASS="literal"
>umask</TT

settings include <TT
CLASS="literal"
>022</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>027</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>077</TT
> (which is the most
restrictive). Normally the umask is set in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/profile</TT
>, so it applies
to all users on the system.  The resulting permission is calculated as
follows: The default permission of  user/group/others (7 for
directories, 6 for files) is combined with the  inverted mask (NOT)
using AND on a per-bit-basis. 
</P

>&#13;Example 1:

>5.4. Trojan Horses</H2
><P
>&#13;"Trojan Horses" are named after the fabled ploy in Virgil's  "Aenid".
The idea is that a cracker distributes a program or binary that sounds
great, and encourages other people to download it and run it as root. Then
the program can compromise their system while they are not paying
attention. While they think the binary they just pulled down does one
thing (and it might very well), it also compromises their security. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You should take care of what programs you install on your
machine. RedHat provides MD5 checksums and PGP signatures on its RPM 
files so you can verify you are installing the real thing. Other 
distributions have similar methods. You should never run any unfamiliar 
binary, for which you don't have the source, as root. Few attackers are 
willing to release source code to public scrutiny.
</P
><P
>&#13;Although it can be complex, make sure you are getting the source for
a program from its real distribution site. If the program is going to
run as root, make sure either you or someone you trust has looked over
the source and verified it.
