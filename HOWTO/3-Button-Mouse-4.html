<P>Some mice, not usually the cheapest ones, have a switch on the bottom
marked `2/3'. Sometimes this may be `PC/MS'. In this case the `2'
setting is for 2 button Microsoft mode, and the `3' for 3 button
MouseSystems mode. The `PC/MS' switch is a bit more complicated.  You
will probably find the `MS' setting is for Microsoft, and the `PC' is
for MouseSystems. You may find the `PC' setting described as ps/2
mode, but it should do MouseSystems as well.  If you have such a mouse,
you can switch the switch to `3' or `PC', put the MouseSystems settings
in your XConfigs (see below) and the mouse should work perfectly in
3-button mode.
