<P>The Hebrew Support for X-Windows &amp; Motif, is a product of El-Mar
Software, which adds Hebrew functionality to many of the parts and layers of
X-Windows and Motif, including Xlib, all of the widgets of Motif, hterm
(Hebrew xterm), demos and simple useful applications (e.g. bi-lingual
Motif-based editor), fonts (including scalable Type1), keyboard-manager in
order to allow Hebrew and push-mode for non-Motif applications, etc. 
<P>Despite allowing many new features and variations for Motif widgets, the 
support doesn't have any modification to internal data-structures of Motif, so
existing applications which were compiled and linked under non-Hebrew
environment and libraries, can be relinked (without compilation!) and run
with Hebrew (you can replace shared-libraries, so even the relink is not
needed!) 
<P>By using another tool of us, Motif/Xplorer, you can take commercial
applications (without their source) and translate them to Hebrew. This was
the way of giving Hebrew support for Oracle Forms 4, Intellicorp's Kappa and
OMW, CA-Unicenter, and many other leading UNIX tools sold in Israel. This
product was purchased and adopted by most of the workstation vendors (9 of
them, including the biggest: Sun, HP, SGI), and many other software houses.
There are Makefiles for more than 30 platforms and operating systems. 
<P>We believe only in open software, so all the customers get the compelete 
source code. We have good relations with the leading forces in this industry,
including the technical staff of X-Consortium and the technical staff of
COSE.
