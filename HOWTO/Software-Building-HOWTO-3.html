<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Using Make</A></H2>

<P>The <CODE>Makefile</CODE> is the key to the build process. In its simplest
form, a Makefile is a script for compiling or building the "binaries",
the executable portions of a package. The Makefile can also provide a
means of updating a software package without having to recompile every
single source file in it, but that is a different story (or a different
article).
<P>At some point, the Makefile launches <CODE>cc</CODE> or <CODE>gcc</CODE>. This
is actually a preprocessor, a C (or C++) compiler, and a linker, invoked
in that order.  This process converts the source into the binaries, the
actual executables.
<P>Invoking <EM>make</EM> usually involves just typing <B>make</B>. This
generally builds all the necessary executable files for the package in
question. However, make can also do other tasks, such as installing the
files in their proper directories (<B>make install</B>) and removing
stale object files (<B>make clean</B>).  Running <B>make -n</B>
permits previewing the build process, as it prints out all the commands
that would be triggered by a make, without actually executing them.
<P>
<P>Only the simplest software uses a generic Makefile. More complex
installations require tailoring the Makefile according to the location
of libraries, include files, and resources on your particular machine.
This is especially the case when the build needs the <CODE>X11</CODE>
libraries to install. <EM>Imake</EM> and <EM>xmkmf</EM> accomplish this
task.
<P>An <CODE>Imakefile</CODE> is, to quote the man page, a "template"
Makefile. The imake utility constructs a Makefile appropriate for your
system from the Imakefile. In almost all cases, however, you would run
<B>xmkmf</B>, a shell script that invokes imake, a front end for it.
Check the README or INSTALL file included in the software archive for
specific instructions.  (If, after dearchiving the source files, there
is an <CODE>Imake</CODE> file present in the base directory, this is a dead
giveaway that <B>xmkmf</B> should be run.)  Read the <CODE>Imake</CODE> and
<CODE>xmkmf</CODE> man pages for a more detailed analysis of the procedure.
<P>Be aware that <CODE>xmkmf</CODE> and <CODE>make</CODE> may need to be invoked as
root, especially when doing a <B>make install</B> to move the binaries
over to the <CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> directories.
Using make as an ordinary user without root privileges will likely
result in <EM>write access denied</EM> error messages because you lack
write permission to system directories. Check also that the binaries
created have the proper execute permissions for you and any other
appropriate users.
<P>Invoking <B>xmkmf</B> uses the <CODE>Imake</CODE> file to build a new
Makefile appropriate for your system. You would normally invoke
<B>xmkmf</B> with the <B>-a</B> argument, to automatically do a
<EM>make Makefiles, make includes,</EM> and <EM>make depend</EM>.  This
sets the variables and defines the library locations for the compiler
and linker.  Sometimes, there will be no <CODE>Imake</CODE> file, instead
there will be an <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> or <CODE>configure</CODE> script that will
accomplish this purpose. Note that if you run <CODE>configure</CODE>, it
should be invoked as <B>./configure</B> to ensure that the correct
<CODE>configure</CODE> script in the current directory is called. In most
cases, the <CODE>README</CODE> file included with the distribution will
explain the install procedure.
<P>It is usually a good idea to visually inspect the <CODE>Makefile</CODE> that
<CODE>xmkmf</CODE> or one of the install scripts builds. The Makefile will
normally be correct for your system, but you may occasionally be
required to "tweak" it or correct errors manually.
<P>
<P>Installing the freshly built binaries into the appropriate system directories
is usually a matter of running <B>make install</B> as root. The usual
directories for system-wide binaries on modern Linux distributions are
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE>, <CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin</CODE>, and <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>. The
preferred directory for new packages is <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>, as this will
keep separate binaries not part of the original Linux installation.
<P>Packages originally targeted for commercial versions of UNIX may attempt
to install in the <CODE>/opt</CODE> or other unfamiliar directory. This will,
of course, result in an installation error if the intended installation
directory does not exist. The simplest way to deal with this is to
create, as root, an <CODE>/opt</CODE> directory, let the package install
there, then add that directory to the <CODE>PATH</CODE> environmental
variable. Alternatively, you may create symbolic links to the
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> directory.
<P>
<P>
<P>Your general installation procedure will therefore be:
<UL>
<LI>Read the <CODE>README</CODE> file and other applicable docs.</LI>
<LI>Run <B>xmkmf -a</B>, or the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> or <CODE>configure</CODE> script.</LI>
<LI>Check the <CODE>Makefile</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>If necessary, run <B>make clean</B>, <B>make Makefiles</B>,
<B>make includes</B>, and <B>make depend</B>.</LI>
<LI>Run <B>make</B>.</LI>
<LI>Check file permissions.</LI>
<LI>If necessary, run <B>make install</B>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P><EM>Notes:</EM>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You would not normally build a package as root. Doing an <B>su</B>
to root is only necessary for installing the compiled binaries into
system directories.
</LI>
<LI>After becoming familiar with <EM>make</EM> and its uses,
you may wish to add additional optimization options passed to
<CODE>gcc</CODE> in the standard <CODE>Makefile</CODE> included or created
in the package you are installing. Some of these common options are
<EM>-O2</EM>, <EM>-fomit-frame-pointer</EM>, <EM>-funroll-loops</EM>,
and <EM>-mpentium</EM> (if you are running a Pentium cpu). Use caution
and good sense when modifying a <CODE>Makefile</CODE>!
</LI>
<LI>After the <EM>make</EM> creates the binaries, you may wish to
<B>strip</B> them. The <B>strip</B> command removes the symbolic
debugging information from the binaries, and reduces their size, often
drastically. This also disables debugging, of course.
</LI>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.auc.dk/pack/">Pack Distribution Project</A> offers a different approach to creating archived software
packages, based on a set of Python scripting tools for managing
symbolic links to files installed in separate <EM>collection
directories</EM>. These archives are ordinary <EM>tarballs</EM>, but
they install in <CODE>/coll</CODE> and <CODE>/pack</CODE> directories. You may
find it necessary to download the <EM>Pack-Collection</EM> from the
above site should you ever run across one of these distributions.</LI>
