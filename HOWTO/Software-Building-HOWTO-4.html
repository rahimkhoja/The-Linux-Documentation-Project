</H2>

<P>
<P>Manually building and installing packages from source is apparently so
daunting a task for some Linux users that they have embraced the popular
<EM>rpm</EM> and <EM>deb</EM> or the newer Stampede <EM>slp</EM> package
formats. While it may be the case that an <EM>rpm</EM> install normally
runs as smoothly and as fast as a software install in a certain other
notorious operating system, some thought should certainly be given to
the disadvantages of self-installing, prepackaged binaries.
<P>First, be aware that software packages are normally released first as
"tarballs", and that prepackaged binaries follow days, weeks, even
months later.  A current <EM>rpm</EM> package is typically at least a
couple of minor version behind the latest "tarball".  So, if you wish
to keep up with all the 'bleeding edge' software, you might not wish to
wait for an <EM>rpm</EM> or <EM>deb</EM> to appear. Some less popular
packages may never be <EM>rpm</EM>'ed.
<P>Second, the "tarball" package may well be more complete, have more
options, and lend itself better to customization and tweaking.  The binary
rpm version may be missing some of the functionality of the full release.
Source <EM>rpm</EM>'s contain the full source code and are equivalent
to the corresponding "tarballs", and they likewise need to be built and
installed using either of the <B>rpm --recompile packagename.rpm</B>
or <B>rpm --rebuild packagename.rpm</B> options.
<P>Third, some prepackaged binaries will not properly install, and even
if they do install, they could crash and core-dump. They may depend on
different library versions than are present in your system, or they may
be improperly prepared or just plain broken. In any case, when installing
an <EM>rpm</EM> or <EM>deb</EM> you necessarily trust the expertise of
the persons who have packaged it.
<P>Finally, it helps to have the source code on hand, to be able to tinker
with and learn from it. It is much more straightforward to have the
source in the archive you are building the binaries from, and not in a
separate source <EM>rpm</EM>.
<P>
<P>Installing an <EM>rpm</EM> package is not necessarily a no-brainer.
If there is a dependency conflict, an <EM>rpm</EM> install will
fail. Likewise, should the <EM>rpm</EM> require a different version of
libraries than the ones present on your system, the install may not work,
even if you create symbolic links to the missing libraries from the ones
in place.  Despite their convenience, <EM>rpm</EM> installs often fail
for the same reasons "tarball" ones do.
<P>You must install <EM>rpm</EM>'s and <EM>deb</EM>'s as root, in order
to have the necessary write permissions, and this opens a potentially
serious security hole, as you may inadvertently clobber system binaries
and libraries, or even install a <EM>Trojan horse</EM> that might wreak
havoc upon your system.  It is therefore important to obtain <EM>rpm</EM>
and <EM>deb</EM> packages from a "trusted source". In any case, you should
run a 'signature check' (against the MD5 checksum) on the package, <B>rpm
--checksig packagename.rpm</B>, before installing. Likewise highly
recommended is running <B>rpm -K --nopgp packagename.rpm</B>.  The
corresponding commands for <EM>deb</EM> packages are <B>dpkg -I | --info
packagename.deb</B> and <B>dpkg -e | --control packagename.deb</B>.

<P>For the truly paranoid (and, in this case there is much
to be said for paranoia), there are the <EM>unrpm</EM>
and <EM>rpmunpack</EM> utilities available from the 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/package">Sunsite utils/package directory</A> for unpacking and checking the individual
components of the packages.
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:klee@debian.org">Klee Diene</A> has written an
experimental <EM>dpkgcert</EM> package for verifying the integrity of
installed <EM>.deb</EM> files against MD5 checksums.  It is available from
the 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/project/experimental">Debian ftp archive</A>.  The current package name
/ version is <EM>dpkgcert_0.2-4.1_all.deb</EM>. The 
<A HREF="http://dpkgcert.jimpick.com">Jim Pick Software</A> site maintains
an experimental server database to provide <EM>dpkgcert</EM> certificates
for the packages in a typical Debian installation.
<P>In their most simple form, the commands <B>rpm -i packagename.rpm</B>
and <B>dpkg --install packagename.deb</B> automatically unpack and
install the software.  Exercise caution, though, since using these
commands blindly may be dangerous to your system's health!
<P>Note that the above warnings also apply, though to a lesser extent,
to Slackware's <EM>pkgtool</EM> installation utility. All "automatic"
software installations require caution.
<P>The 
<A HREF="http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/rc42/program/martian.html">martian</A> and 
<A HREF="http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">alien</A> programs allow conversion between the <EM>rpm</EM>,
<EM>deb</EM>, Stampede <EM>slp</EM>, and <EM>tar.gz</EM> package
formats. This makes these packages accessible to all Linux distributions.
<P>Carefully read the man pages for the <EM>rpm</EM>
and <EM>dpkg</EM> commands, and refer to the 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/RPM-HOWTO">RPM HOWTO</A>, TFUG's 
<A HREF="http://www.tfug.org/helpdesk/linux/rpm.html">Quick Guide to Red Hat's Package Manager</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/debian-faq-7.html">The Debian Package Management Tools</A> for more detailed information.

<A HREF="mailto:hubicka@paru.cas.cz">Jan Hubicka</A> wrote
a very nice fractal package called <EM>xaos</EM>.  At his 
<A HREF="http://www.paru.cas.cz/~hubicka/XaoS">home page</A>, both
<CODE>.tar.gz</CODE> and <CODE>rpm</CODE> packages are available.  For the sake
of convenience, let us try the rpm version, rather than the "tarball".
<P>Unfortunately, the rpm of <EM>xaos</EM> fails to install. Two separate
rpm versions misbehave.
<P><B>rpm -i --test XaoS-3.0-1.i386.rpm</B>

error: failed dependencies:

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The strange thing is that <CODE>libslang.so.0</CODE>, <CODE>libpng.so.0</CODE>,
and <CODE>libaa.so.1</CODE> are all present in <CODE>/usr/lib</CODE> on the
system tested. The rpms of <EM>xaos</EM> must have been built with
slightly different versions of those libraries, even if the release
numbers are identical.
<P>As a test, let us try installing <CODE>xaos-3.0-8.i386.rpm</CODE> with the
<EM>--nodeps</EM> option to force the install. A trial run of <EM>xaos</EM>
crashes.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

xaos: error in loading shared libraries: xaos: undefined symbol: __fabsl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Let us stubbornly try to get to the bottom of this.  Running <EM>ldd</EM>
on the <EM>xaos</EM> binary to find its library dependencies shows
all the necessary shared libraries present. Running <EM>nm</EM> on the
<CODE>/usr/lib/libaa.so.1</CODE> library to list its symbolic references
shows that it is indeed missing <EM>__fabsl</EM>.  Of course, the absent
reference <EM>could</EM> be missing from one of the other libraries...
There is nothing to be done about that, short of replacing one or more
libraries.
<P>Enough! Download the "tarball", <CODE>XaoS-3.0.tar.gz</CODE>, available from
the 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ta.jcu.cz/pub/linux/hubicka/XaoS/3.0">ftp site</A>, as well as from the home page.  Try building it. Running
<B>./configure</B>, <B>make</B>, and finally (as root) <B>make
install</B>, works flawlessly.
<P>This is one of an number of examples of prepackaged binaries being more
trouble than they are worth.
