<H2><A NAME="s15">15. IPX tunnel over IP</A></H2>

<P>Many of you will be in a situation where you have two Novell Local Area Netorks
with only an IP connection between them. How do you play multiplayer deathmatch
DOOM for DOS via this arrangement you might ask ? Andreas Godzina
<CODE>&lt;ag@agsc.han.de></CODE> has an answer for you in the form of
<EM>ipxtunnel</EM>.
<P><EM>ipxtunnel</EM> provides a bridge-like facility for IPX by allowing
IPX packets to be encapsulated with tcp/ip datagrams so that they can
be carried by a tcp/ip connection. It listens for IPX packets and when it
hears one it wraps it within a tcp/ip datagram and routes it to a remote
IP address that you specify. For this to work of course the machine that
you route the encapsulated IPX must also be running a copy of the same
version of <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> as you.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Obtaining <EM>ipxtunnel</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>You can obtain <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> from
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons">sunsite.unc.edu</A>
or mirror sites.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 Building <EM>ipxtunnel</EM></A>
</H2>

<P><EM>ipxtunnel</EM> built cleanly for me using the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xvfz .../ipxtunnel.tgz
# cd ipxtunnel
# make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 Configuring <EM>ipxtunnel</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>Configuration for <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> is easy. Lets say that your friends
machine is <CODE>gau.somewhere.com</CODE> and your machine is called
<CODE>gim.sw.edu</CODE>. <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> uses a configuration file called
<CODE>/etc/ipxtunnel.conf</CODE>. This file allows you to specify the default UDP
port to use for the tcp/ip connection, where to send the encapsulated data
and which of your local interfaces <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> should listen on
and deliver IPX packets to.
<P>A simple configuration file would look like the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#
# /etc/ipxtunnel.conf for gim.sw.edu
#
# The UDP port to use:                       (default 7666)
port 7777
#
# The remote machine to send IPX packets to: (no default)
remote gau.somewhere.com
#
# The local interfaces to listen for IPX on: (default eth0)
interface eth0
interface eth1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Obviously the other machine would have a similar configuration file specifying
this machine as a <CODE>remote</CODE> host.

<H2><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4 Testing and using <EM>ipxtunnel</EM></A>
</H2>

<P><EM>ipxtunnel</EM> acts <B>like</B> an IPX bridge, so the IPX networks
at either end of the link should probably be the same. Andreas has never
tested the <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> in an environment that actually supports
Novell file servers so if you do try this in a real environment let Andreas
know if it works or not.
<P>If the <EM>ipxtunnel</EM> is working you should be able to start your
DOOM machines up at each end of the link running IPX mode and they should
see each other.
<P>Andreas has only used this code over good high speed lines and he makes no
claim as to its performance when your link is low speed. Again, let him
know what works for you and what doesn't.
