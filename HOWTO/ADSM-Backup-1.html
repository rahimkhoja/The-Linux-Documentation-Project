<P>ADSM is a network-based backup system, sold by IBM, in use at
many organizations.  There are clients for a large variety of systems
(different UNIX brands, Windows, Novell, Mac, Windows NT).
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, there is no native Linux version.
<P>You will have to use the SCO binary, and install the iBCS2-emulator
for running ADSM.  This description is for ADSM v2r1.
<P>At the time if this writing, I am only aware of a version which works
with the i386 version of Linux.
