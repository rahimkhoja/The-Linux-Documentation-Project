<P>Welcome, gentle reader. 
<P>If you have been programming for any length of time in a Unix environment,
you will have encountered the mystical programs Lex &amp; YACC, or as they
are known to GNU/Linux users worldwide, Flex &amp; Bison, where Flex is a
Lex implementation by Vern Paxon and Bison the GNU version of YACC. We will
call these programs Lex and YACC throughout - the newer versions are
upwardly compatible, so you can use Flex and Bison when trying our examples.
<P>These programs are massively useful, but as with your C compiler, their
manpage does not explain the language they understand, nor how to use them.
YACC is really amazing when used in combination with Lex, however, the Bison
manpage does not describe how to integrate Lex generated code with your
Bison program.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What this document is NOT</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several great books which deal with Lex &amp; YACC. By all means
read these books if you need to know more. They provide far more information
than we ever will. See the 'Further Reading' section at the end. This
document is aimed at bootstrapping your use of Lex
&amp; YACC, to allow you to create your first programs.
<P>The documentation that comes with Flex and BISON is also excellent, but no
tutorial. They do complement my HOWTO very well though. They too are
referenced at the end.
<P>I am by no means a YACC/Lex expert. When I started writing this document, I
had exactly two days of experience. All I want to accomplish is to make
those two days easier for you.
<P>In no way expect the HOWTO to show proper YACC and Lex style. Examples
have been kept very simple and there may be better ways to write them. If
you know how to, please let me know.

machine readable form. See the
