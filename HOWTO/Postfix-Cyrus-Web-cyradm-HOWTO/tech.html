>Unlike sendmail, postfix is not one monolithic program, it is a compilation of small programs, each of
	      which has a specialized function. 
	      At this point I don't what to go into details about what each program does what.

>2.2. Cyrus IMAP</H2
><P
>Cyrus IMAP is developed and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University.</P
><P
>Unlike the WU-IMAPd package, Cyrus uses its own method to store the user's mail. 
	Each message is stored in its own file. 
	The benefit of using separate files is improved reliability since only one message is lost if there is a filesystem error.
	Metadata such as the status of a message (seen, etc) is stored in a database.
	Additionally, the messages are indexed to improve Cyrus performance, specially with lots of users and/or lots of big emails.
	There is nothing else as fast as the Cyrus IMAP-server.</P
><P
>	Another very important feature is that you don't need a local Un*x user for each account. All users are 
	authenticated by the IMAP-Server. This makes it a great solution when you have a really huge number of users.</P
><P
>	User administration is done by special IMAP-commands. This allows you to either use the commandline interface
	or use one of the available Web interfaces. This method is much more secure than a Webinterface to
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
> /etc/passwd</TT
>.</P
><P
>Starting from Cyrus 2.1, SASL-lib version 2 is used for authentication. 
	For the setup described in this HOWTO, a tree-layer authentication is implemented.
	Cyrus authenticates with saslauthdaemon which forwards the request
	to pam_mysql which finally looks up the user information in the MySQL-table.</P
><P
>	Since CMU changed the license policy for Cyrus, this software is going to be used by many more users.</P

>2.3. Cyrus SASL</H2
><P
>SASL means »Simple Authentication and Security Layer«. It is standardized by the IETF (Internet 
	Engineering Taskforce). SASL is used by network servers (in this case Cyrus-IMAP) to
	handle authentication requests from clients.</P
><P
>Cyrus SASL is a extensive software, and sometimes not	easy to understand.
	Even I have just the minimum knowledge needed to write this HOWTO.</P

NAME="OPENSSL"

>2.4. OpenSSL</H2
><P
>OpenSSL is a library needed by SASL for encryption of the data-stream. It is used by 
	almost all opensource software that need encryption.
	Most or all Un*x distributions come with a pre-installed OpenSSL.
	Be sure to also install the appropriate devel-package. If you like, you can 
	compile OpenSSL by yourself. This will be required if you need to fix a security hole.

>2.5. MySQL Database</H2
><P
>MySQL is a very fast, powerful and very easy to use database.</P
><P
>Since Cyrus can authenticate its users with pam, you can use pam_mysql as a connector to the
	user database stored in MySQL. This allows you to create a nice Webinterface for your users for changing 
	passwords, defining and deleting aliases and more.</P

NAME="PAM-MYSQL"
></A
>2.6. pam_mysql</H2
><P
>pam means "Pluggable Authentication module" and was originally proposed by some people at Sun.
	In meantime a lot of modules have been developed. One of them is an interface to MySQL</P
><P
>With pam_mysql you store the users password in a MySQL database. Further, Postfix is able to
	lookup aliases from a MySQL-table. At the end of the day, you have a base for all administrative tasks
	to be done by the postmaster.</P
><P
>You will be able to delegate some tasks to powerusers. For example, tasks such as creating accounts, changing passwords and creating new aliases can be delegated to an administrator for a particular domain. 
	At the end of the day, you, as a sysadmin, will have the time to do some more productive tasks or write a HOWTO for the Linux Documentation Project.</P
