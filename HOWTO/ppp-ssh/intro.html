><P
>The technique described in this HOWTO uses PPP to convert packets
into a character stream and SSH to encrypt it
and transmit it to the remote computer.  Most system administrators
are well acquainted with the tools and configuration files needed
to set up a PPP-SSH VPN.</P
><P
>While it works well with moderate loads over a reliable
connection, be warned that a PPP-SSH VPN is subject to
some scalability problems.  I've included a list of benefits in
<A
HREF="introduction.html#BENEFITS"
>Section 2.1</A
> and drawbacks in
<A
HREF="introduction.html#DRAWBACKS"
>Section 2.2</A
> so you can decide
for yourself if a PPP-SSH VPN is a good fit for your needs.</P

><P
>I took some notes as I adapted Bart Trojanowski's excellent
<A
HREF="http://www.jukie.net/~bart/security/vpn/"
TARGET="_top"
>instructions</A
> to a newer version of PPP running on
my Debian system.
A few weeks later, I converted the notes into SGML.
Eventually, those evolved into this HOWTO.</P
><P
>Bart's instructions were based on Arpad Magosanyi's 
good but now fairly dated
<A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/VPN.html"
TARGET="_top"
>VPN Mini-HOWTO</A
>.
If you run into troubles and my document doesn't seem to help,
or if you're running an older version of the Linux kernel or PPP,
you'll definitely want to give his HOWTO a read.</P
