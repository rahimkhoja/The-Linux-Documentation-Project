You may or may not need to use the -P option, depending on how your
client's firewall is set up.  If port 22 is blocked on your client
(not a bad idea if it's not running an SSH server),
then -P tells ssh to use an unprivileged port even though it's
running as a priveleged user.

the suid bit, and arrange permissions by groups.  However, this can get

I find the sudo utility to be a much better solution.</P

>sudo gives ordinary users superuser powers,
but only for a very limited set of commands.
The system administrator gets to decide what commands are allowed
and how much logging to perform. In this case, we want to
allow the user "vpn" to run pppd with superuser privilege, but
not be allowed to do anything else.</P
