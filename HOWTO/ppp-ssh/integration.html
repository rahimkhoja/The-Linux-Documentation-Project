a very informative error) to a log file or, if you're not aesthetically
inclined, leave it alone and let your screen get all mucked up.

near the end of the boot process.
When it hits this script, your machine will wait
until the VPN is up before it continues booting.  If this is an
issue, you can write your own /etc/init.d/vpn-pppssh
script that calls the /usr/local/bin/vpn-pppssh script in the
background.  The link will come up as your machine finishes
booting.</P

This sets the IPPARAM variable for this
invocation to "vpn", which we then check in the startup script.
If it's set to vpn, then we know we're in the middle of bringing
up the vpn, so we just exit without error.  Otherwise, we fire it up.
