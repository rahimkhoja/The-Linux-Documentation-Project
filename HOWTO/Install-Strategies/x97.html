>What <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> does is make a new primary
      partition out of the free space in your hard disk. This is an inherently
      dangerous operation and it's a good idea to back up all your important
      data lest something go wrong. Having said that
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> has been used successfully by a large
      number of people in different conditions and unless there is something
      already wrong with your hard disk, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FAT</SPAN
> (File Allocation
      Table) or partition table things will work just fine. You should read the
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> documentation.</P
><P
>Before you set out to partition the hard disk you have to decide
      how you want to boot into Linux. The default and most common method is to
      use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> &#8211; a simple and basic bootloader
      program that overwrites (after saving) your hard disk's
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</SPAN
> (Master Boot Record) and on booting the system
      gives you a choice between booting either Windows or Linux. If you select
      Windows it boots Windows and you are met with the familiar windows screen
      or if you select Linux it boots Linux and if you don't make a choice in
      the stipulated time &#8211; could be anything from
      ±<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5</TT
> seconds depending on on how you set it up
      &#8211; it boots the default operating system, Windows or Linux, again
      depending on how you set it up. You can restore your original
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</SPAN
> anytime, when uninstalling Linux for instance,
      either by typing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/sbin/lilo <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-u</TT
></B
> within
      Linux or typing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fdisk <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>/MBR</TT
></B
> in DOS
      (this will overwrite the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</SPAN
> with the original Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MBR</SPAN
>) needless to say you would lose the option to boot
      into Linux after this and thus access to your Linux partition.</P
><P
>The problem with using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> especially
      for those with large disks is you would have to give up a substantial
      chunk of your disk space to Linux. This is not a flexible solution since
      while you can access your Windows partition from within Linux &#8211; the
      large <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MPEG</SPAN
> files can thus be stored in Windows and
      accessed by both operating systems &#8211; the alternate is not
      true.</P
><P
>This is because of an arcane <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
> limitation
      that limits <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> to the first
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinders of the hard disk. Windows and Linux have
      no such limitations &#8211; it has something to do with address
      translation and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>LBA</SPAN
> which I have yet to fully
      understand. Suffice to know the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
> cannot access data
      that is beyond this <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit and since
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> is dependent on the
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
> to boot the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>OS</SPAN
>'s nor can
      it. Thus if you want to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> to boot Linux
      you got to make sure that the Linux partition is well below the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit. My hard disk &#8211; and most
      modern hard disks have more than <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinders &#8211;
      has <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1650</TT
> cylinders and using
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> means making the Linux partition at about
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1000</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1010</TT
> cylinder mark which
      translates into a whopping <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5.2</TT
> Gb of
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.9</TT
> Gb to Linux and this wasn't working for me
      since my Linux stuff hardly need more than <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
> Gb
      and my Windows data on the other hand with <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MP3</SPAN
>'s and
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>MPEG</SPAN
> movies needs a lot more than
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>7</TT
> Gb.</P
><P
>The solution, and in Linux there are always solutions, is
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Loadlin</SPAN
>, an underrated alternative to
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> which is inexplicably not as popular or
      widespread, inexplicable because it's far more flexible. If you intend to
      use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Loadlin</SPAN
> and for those with large hard-disks
      it's an excellent alternative you don't have to worry about the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit. Even better you can launch Linux
      from your Windows desktop and modify your
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>autoexec.bat</TT
> file to give you an option to boot into
      either of the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>OS</SPAN
>'s during boot time not unlike
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
>. You are then free to size your partitions
      as you please. In my case a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.2</TT
> Gb extended
      partition with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> logical partitions. That's right
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> partitions. It's normal to make three partitions, one
      for the Kernel boot files, one for the root partition and one for the swap
      partition but more on that later.</P
><P
>If you must use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> but are unwilling
      to give up a lot of space there is a solution. Place the Linux partition
      in the middle of the disk. You have to split the new partition you just
      created using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> into <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>
      (you would have to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> once again for
      this) the first partition which falls within the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
>
      cylinder limit can be used for Linux and the second you can use for
      Windows. Thus your hard disk will then have <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
>
      partitions the first and third for Windows and the one in the middle for
      Linux. I don't like this arrangement but it's up to you. (At the moment we
      are refering to the Linux partition as one but during the installation you
      will split it into <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> using the Linux tools) You can
      also make a small <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>15</TT
>-<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>20</TT
> Mb
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> partition and place it before
      the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder mark and the rest of the installation
      anywhere on the hard disk but again I quite don't like this.</P
