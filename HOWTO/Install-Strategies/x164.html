>Now we are ready to actually partition the hard disk. First make a
      DOS boot disk (type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>format a: <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>/s</TT
></B
> at
      the DOS prompt or in DOS). Put the following three files in the disk,
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fips.exe</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>restorrb.exe</TT
> and
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>errors.txt</TT
>. Defragment your hard disk &#8211; this
      puts all the data at the beginning leaving enough space for
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> to create a new partition from. If you use
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Norton SpeedDisk</SPAN
> select the unfragment free
      space option. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Norton</SPAN
> usually puts data at the
      end of the disk and this will prevent <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> from
      creating a new partition. Run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Scandisk</SPAN
> and
      reboot using the bootdisk you just created.</P
><P
>Type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fips</B
> at the prompt and
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> will show you your partition table with a
      warning about partition table inconsistency. If your disk has more than
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinders its usually safe to ignore this
      warning. Next <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> will ask you is you want to
      proceed &#8211; the program is extremely meticulous &#8211; answer yes
      obviously and when prompted to save a backup of your partition table and
      boot sector answer yes &#8211; this step is absolutely vital as it allows
      you to restore your hard disk to its unpartioned single partition state
      should anything go wrong. It also comes in handy if you want to uninstall
      Linux or resize your Linux partition. It doesn't matter what happens to
      the new partition in the meantime, if you have the back up you can restore
      your hard disk to its original unpartioned state. This reversible
      operation will work in all circumstances but one; if you format your
      original (Windows) partition which was split to make space for Linux in
      the meantime, the original <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FAT</SPAN
> is overwritten with a
      new and smaller one and the restore operation will not work.</P
><P
>After making the backup you will be presented with a screen with
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> numbers, the first represents your original partition
      &#8211; notice it is at its smallest size, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
>
      has allocated all free space in the hard disk to the new partition, this
      is the default behavior. The second column shows the cylinder info which
      will be the guide for those who plan to use
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
>. The third shows the size of the new
      partition you are going to create &#8211; it is at its largest size. Use
      the arrow keys to resize the partition, you would just have to reduce the
      size of the new partition since it is at its maximum to a size you
      want. For <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> users the new partition has to
      be below the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder mark,
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1000</TT
> is a reasonable beginning for the new
      partition. After you are satisfied with the size of your new partition
      press enter, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> will ask you to confirm and
      write the new partition table.</P
><P
>Reboot your system. Remember to change the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
>
      settings to boot from the hard disk or you will end up rebooting with the
      floppy. Double click <SPAN
CLASS="GUIICON"
>My Computer</SPAN
> and you will see the
      result of all the hard work, there will be a new drive labelled
      <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>D</I
> alongside the original
      <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
>. Don't touch <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>D</I
>, run
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>scandisk</SPAN
> on your original partition
      (<I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
>) &#8211; hopefully there will be no errors
      &#8211; and at this point you are ready to install Linux.</P
><P
>Some of the Linux documentation mistakenly ask you to delete the
      newly created partition using Windows <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
>. Do
      not commit that blunder because if you do the Linux partitions will show
      up in <SPAN
CLASS="GUIICON"
>My Computer</SPAN
> when you reboot after installing
      Linux and since Windows obviously cannot read these drives and the
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ext2</SPAN
> filesystem, using
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Explorer</SPAN
> and acessing your hard disk in Windows
      will become a time consuming and destabilizing affair. So don't do
      it.</P
