></H1
><P
>Those who intend to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Loadlin</SPAN
> however
      cannot use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</SPAN
>, they will have to use
      Linux <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> which may have an intimidating
      reputation but is actually pretty simple. When presented with the
      <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>installation type</SPAN
> screen select
      <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>custom</SPAN
> and with <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>fdisk</SPAN
> (you
      will find a small button with <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>fdisk</SPAN
> on it at the
      top of the screen). For some reason <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</SPAN
>
      doesn't let you proceed with the installation if your 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> partition is above the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1024</TT
> cylinder limit so if you try to use it to create
      the partitions the install program will refuse to
      proceed. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> is a pretty straight forward
      program and easy to use too. First you have to delete the partition you
      just created using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
>. Many people don't
      understand why they have to delete the partition they just created at
      considerable risk. This new partition is actually a
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FAT32</SPAN
> partiton which Linux cannot use and when you
      delete it it doesn't revert to being a part of <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
>
      but is actually <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>UNPARTITIONED FREE SPACE</SPAN
> which you
      can use to create new partitions.</P
><P
>You have to understand a few <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
>
      operations, typing <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>m</B
> lists all the options, typing
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>p</B
> at the prompt shows you the current partition table,
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>d</B
> deletes a partiton, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>n</B
> creates a
      partition, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>q</B
> quits without saving changes so if you make
      any mistakes there is nothing to worry about just type <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>q</B
>
      and start all over again, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>w</B
> writes changes to the
      partition table use only after you are sure and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>L</B
> shows
      you the hex numbers for different partition types but you only need to
      know <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>Linux native</SPAN
> is hex number
      <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>83</TT
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>Linux swap</SPAN
> is hex number
      <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>82</TT
>. So why do you need the Hex numbers? While
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</SPAN
> allows you to mount a swap partition
      without going into the hex numbers in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> the
      only way to make a swap partiton is to give it its correct hex number
      which is <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>82</TT
>.</P
><P
>Let's start, in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> type
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>p</B
> at the prompt and you will see the current partition
      table. Type <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>d</B
> and select the partition you want to delete
      which in this case would be 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
> (just type <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>)
      type <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>p</B
> again and you will see the change reflected in the
      partition table. There will now be a single <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>FAT32</SPAN
>
      partition <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
> (which is
      actually <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
>). Type <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>n</B
> to create a
      new partition and for <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>type of partition</TT
> the choices being
      <EM
>primary</EM
> or <EM
>extended</EM
> select
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>e</B
>. There is no hard and fast rule about this for instance
      you could have a primary partition for 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> and an extended partition
      holding two logical partitions <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> and
      <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>swap</SPAN
>. I recommend an extended partition that
      holds three logical partitions. Now you have to size your extended
      partition properly since it's a container for the three logical
      partitions. From now on you just have to respond to
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
>. It will ask you to set the size of the
      extended partition that you want to create. This partition will start
      where your Windows partition ends and ends at the end of the disk. You can
      either give the size in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>M</SPAN
> (megabytes) in cylinder
      numbers or in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>K</SPAN
> (kilobytes). Just accept the default
      for the start of the partition and select the end cylinder number for the
      end &#8211; <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> will give you the end
      cylinder number.</P
><P
>Repeat the operation for the three logical partitions, only this
      time you would have to select logical instead of extended and the
      appropriate sizes which are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>16</TT
> Mb for the boot
      partition, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127</TT
> Mb for the swap partition (the size
      of the swap partition is variable depending on installed
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RAM</SPAN
>, double your <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RAM</SPAN
> is recommended)
      and the rest of the free space for the root 
      ( <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> ) partition. Find your way
      &#8211; it's simple, really! After creating the three partitions type
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>p</B
> and you will see the partitions you just created. There
      will be <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
> (extended)
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda5</TT
> (logical) 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda6</TT
> (logical) and 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda7</TT
> (logical). There is just
      one thing left to do, set the hex number for the swap partition. Type
      <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>t</B
> and select the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127</TT
> Mb partition
      you created which would be 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda6</TT
> enter
      <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>6</TT
> for the partition number and
      <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>82</TT
> for the hex number (you will be prompted) and you
      have just finished with partitioning. Type <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>w</B
> after making
      sure and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> will write the new partition
      table and exit. The next screen will be the 
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</SPAN
> screen our
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Lilo</SPAN
> friends 
      have already seen and you just have to mount the partitions with
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Disk Druid</SPAN
>. Select 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda5</TT
> (the
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>16</TT
> Mb partition) and mount it as 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
>. Select 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda7</TT
> and mount it as 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> (the root partition)</P
