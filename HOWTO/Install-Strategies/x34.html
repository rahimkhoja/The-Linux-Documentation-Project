>The primary purpose of this document is
      to make the co-existance between Windows and Linux as simple and uncomplex
      as possible which means as far as Windows is concerned Linux doesn't
      exist. It is now possible to install Linux on a Windows partition as a disk
      image with what is known as the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>loopback</SPAN
> filesystem
      &#8211; RedHat and Mandrake offer this &#8211; but it's an extremely bad
      idea because of the way Windows handles files. Defragmenting the system will
      become a nightmare and Linux itself will crawl and it will ruin both your
      Windows and Linux experience. The same applies to the
      <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Umsdos</SPAN
> filesystem (though Linux won't crawl) and
      it's best to install Linux on a partition of its own. This document makes a
      few presumptions but nothing to worry about &#8211; just a few.</P

>With that out of the way we can begin. The first thing to do is to
      make space for Linux. Like other Linux wannabes you are likely to be stuck
      with a huge single partition with Windows on it. This would be your
      <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
> drive. In my case it was hogging
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>13.5</TT
> gigs. You have to make a separate partition
      for Linux out of this space (which would then be labelled as
      <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>D</I
>). You can either use Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> which really is not a good idea as it
      would entail losing all your data and making new partitions from scratch,
      one for Windows and one for Linux, or you can take the easier and far more
      convenient way out and use a free and excellent non-destructive
      partitioning utility called <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
>. What makes
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> special is its ability to create a new
      partition out of the free space in your <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
>
      partition without any loss of data. The latest version of
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.0</TT
>) is available at
      its homepage <A

      and most Linux distributions carry it under the 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dostools</TT
> or 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dosutils</TT
> directory in the primary
      cd.</P
><P
>We are going to concentrate on using
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> so if you are going to use Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> &#8211; which actually is totally
      unnecessary unless you have just bought a new system and even then it's a
      better idea to make a single partition with Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
>, install Windows on it and then use
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fips</SPAN
> to split it for reasons that I'm going to
      explain later in this document &#8211; or a commercial partition utility
      like <SPAN
