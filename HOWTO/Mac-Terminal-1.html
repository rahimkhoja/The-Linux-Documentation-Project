<P>This mini-HOWTO should give you some Insanely Great ideas for how to
make your Macintosh work with Linux.  Unfortunately, I have been very
busy, and so I haven't been able to include even half of what I wanted
to include, like using MacTCP and Open Transport to connect to your
Linux box via a PPP line.  That will need to wait for future versions.
<P>This mini-HOWTO doesn't cover networking with LocalTalk and AppleTalk,
either.  I might explore these avenues if there's enough interest in,
say, printing to a LaserWriter printer from Linux.  Otherwise, it
seems to me that such applications, being more trouble than they're
worth (not to mention pricey), are beyond the scope of this document.
<P>I don't plan to cover MkLinux in this document, either.  It's more than
adequately documented elsewhere.  
<P>So if you have ideas for this document, drop me a line at the e-mail
above.  Both systems embody a lot of the beginner's mindset as well as
technical prowess, and in my opinion they don't talk to each other
nearly enough.
