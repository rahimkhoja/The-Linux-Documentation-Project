<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="Samba-Authenticated-Gateway-HOWTO.html#toc6.1">Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>We will stick to setting up the network, user management and
policies on the Windows workstations.</P>

<P>I will not go through all those steps, naming each dialog box.
I will presume that if you can read and understand this document
you can find your way through that mess.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="Samba-Authenticated-Gateway-HOWTO.html#toc6.2">Network protocols</A>
</H2>

<P>First, unless you really need, remove all network protocols but
TCP/IP. Even without their own protocol, Windows machines like to
broadcast a lot, and this doesn't please anyone. Anyway, with TCP/IP
who needs anything else?</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="Samba-Authenticated-Gateway-HOWTO.html#toc6.3">DHCP setup</A>
</H2>

<P>If you setup a DHCP server on your Linux box, remember that Windows
workstations can get the nameservers and gateway's address besides
its own IP address from it. So, you don't need to set all these items
on each workstation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="Samba-Authenticated-Gateway-HOWTO.html#toc6.4">Join your Linux server domain</A>
</H2>

<P>Configure the Windows workstation to log in a Domain, and give
the domain name of your Linux server. This is essential to the gateway
work.</P>

<P>You must know that in order to join some versions of Windows
to a SAMBA domain controller, you must create machine accounts in
your Linux PDC. Check the SAMBA documentation on how to setup your
PDC to the specific version of Windows which you have.</P>

<H3>Windows fo workgroups</H3>

<P>This version seems to need no special configuration to join the
Linux PDC domain.</P>

<P>The netlogon script shall be named "WfWg.bat" so when %a
is translated the right script is chosen.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
REM WFWG.BAT
net use z: \\linux\samba /yes
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Windows 95/98/ME</H3>

<P>These versions also seems to need no special configuration to
join the Linux PDC domain.</P>

<P>The netlogon script shall be named "Win95.bat" so when %a
is translated the right script is chosen.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
REM WIN95.BAT
net use z: \\linux\samba /yes
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Windows NT</H3>

<P>This version requires machine accounts at the Linux box. Check
the SAMBA documentation.</P>

<P>The netlogon script shall be named "WinNT.bat" so when %a
is translated the right script is chosen.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
REM WINNT.BAT
net use z: \\linux\samba /yes /persistent:no
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Windows 2000</H3>

<P>This version requires machine accounts at the Linux box. Again,
check the SAMBA documentation.</P>

<P>The netlogon script shall be named "Win2K.bat" so when %a
is translated the right script is chosen.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
REM WIN2K.BAT
net use z: \\linux\samba /yes /persistent:no
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Windows XP</H3>

<P>This version needs a machine account at the Linux box and a tweak
at the registry, as follows.</P>

<P>Locate the key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\RequireSignOrSeal".
The default value is 1. Set it to 0 and it will no more complain
about joining the domain.</P>

<P>If you have many workstation to configure create a file named
anything.reg with the following content and use it to modify the
"faulty" registry.</P>

<P>
<PRE>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters]
&quot;requiresignorseal&quot;=dword:00000000
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This version also needs an adjust at the logon script. Sometimes
it insists on making the mounting persistent. The netlogon script
shall be named "WinXP.bat" so when %a is translated the right
script is chosen.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
REM WINXP.BAT
net use z: \\linux\samba /yes /persistent:no
</PRE>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5</A> <A HREF="Samba-Authenticated-Gateway-HOWTO.html#toc6.5">Policy editor</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a utility named policy editor bundled on the Windows
CD. The file name is poledit.exe. This tool, as the name suggest,
allows to create a user and system policy file.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, this tool does not generate a plain text configuration
file, so I can't place an example here.</P>

<P>Use the policy editor to create a policy to your workstations
and users. You should disable the local password cache and domain
cache in order to get some security. Save the policy file as config.pol
and place it at the netlogon share of your Linux server. In this
way, your Windows workstations will download and use the config.pol
file to set their policy. Of course this task must be done on a Windows
machine.</P>

<P>If you don't use a config.pol file, your Windows workstations
will annoy you asking for a Windows password and you will become
nuts trying to synchronize and manage your Domain and Windows passwords.
It seems that the OS doesn't know that it joined a domain. You must
tell it and then you have to slap it in the face so it will believe
you.</P>
