<P>Okay, now comes the fun part: Figuring out what files need to be on
the system disk, and what packages that you want (and can fit) on
your ZIP drive.
<P>I decided that the easiest way to get started was install Slackware
directly to the ZIP drive.  I decided on this approach mostly
because Slackware is a smaller distribution then Red Hat, and it
would be easier to trim out what I didn't want.  That and the fact
that I am using the Slackware distribution anyway made it an
obvious choice.
<P>Installing Slackware onto the ZIP disk is easy, as root run the
setup program, and choose /iomega as the install to partition, set
the install from partition to where the Slackware sources are
(cdrom, hardrive, etc), select install and follow the prompts.

</H2>

<P>The hardest part is deciding what to add, and what not to add.
Obviously, you'll need the 'A' series (Which is about 8 megs), the
rest is up to you.
<P>I managed to trim down the Slackware release to a respectable
installation of 70 megs, which included gcc/g++, perl, X11R6
(NOT ALL OF IT!), sendmail, online docs (Minus all the development
man pages, but including all the howto's), and an assortment of
other goodies, while leaving about 10 megs free for user files.  YMMV
