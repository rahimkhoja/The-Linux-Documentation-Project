<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This document describes how an X terminal manufactured by NCD (Network
Computing Devices) can be connected to and booted from a UNIX host using
BootP (boot protocol). Many terminals are also capable of booting with
RARP, NFS or locally from a PCMCIA card or over a serial link (either
directly or with a modem).
<P>Although the material in this document was prepared based on experience
with a single model of X terminal, much of the information applies to other
models and other X terminals generally. There is also an Linux X terminal
mini HOWTO document (declared obsolete by HOWTO maintainers at the time of
writing and therefore possibly not available in all Linux distributions)
which overlaps material from this document. That document covers X terminal
information more generally.
<P>
