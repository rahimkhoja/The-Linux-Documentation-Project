<H2><A NAME="s14">14. Installing Slackware, Caldera</A>   </H2>

<P>This section is written by Florent SAUNIER. <BR>
sabetflo@freesurf.fr
<P>Here, '&amp;' is used for the root prompt, rather than '$'.
<P>
<P>I have performed a Slackware installation using PLIP very
succesfully. I have also been able to install RedHat and Caldera
Open linux using the very same method described below.
<P>As previously specified by Gilles, a Slackware installation requires
everything specified in the chapter "What do you need?" with the time
increased to 10 hours if you desire to install xfree(86) and some
development tools.
<P>Further on, you first need to read Gilles' installation as I set up
mine according to his method.
<P>Finally, I have performed Slackware and Caldera installation on
a Twinhead 550C laptop, with 8Mb Ram, and 2Gbytes Hard drive.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.1">14.1 Slakware installation</A>
    </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>1- Make 2 disks (boot and root) and prepare a plip disk</LI>
<LI>2- Install PLIP module</LI>
<LI>3- Create a NFS drive to use PLIP with</LI>
<LI>4- Launch the Slackware (or Caldera) Installation</LI>
<LI>5- Drink all remaining  coffee and go to bed waiting completion of
installation. Graham said: Comment ? Du café avant de dormir ?
Non !  Le café au petit matin, après la nuit. Avant, du vin.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Making boot,root and plip disks      </H3>

<P>To install Slackware verion using an ATAPI CDROM from your source,
you will need the standard kernel image bareapm.i or bare.i. If you
want to make an install with SCSI support, use the scsinet.i image.
<P>Other images exist, such as net.i which should include the PLIP
function but on my i486 laptop, Twinhead550C, the image does not
work.  In my experience, the standard image always works on
any laptop I have used.
<P>
<H3>1a- creating the boot and root disks.      </H3>

<P>
<P>From DOS (PC-DOS, DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ...) create the boot disk by typing:
<PRE>
 
    rawrite bareapm.i
    
</PRE>

then create the root disks:
<PRE>
    rawrite color.gz.a  (if you are using a color screen)
    
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>1b- Creating the PLIP disk      </H3>

<P>On a DOS formated disk copy the following files:
<UL>
<LI>1- plip.o (object program for the plip tool)</LI>
<LI>2- parport_pc</LI>
<LI>3- parport</LI>
</UL>

Those modules are compulsory prior to a PLIP install, you will find
them into the Slackware installation CDROM under the directory
<CODE>/MODULES</CODE>.  The same applies to the Caldera
installation. Run a "find" if you cannot find them.
<P>
<H3>1c- launching the installation.      </H3>

<P>Insert your boot disk in your Laptop and start the computer. 
Follow the installation procedure and wait until the system ask for 
the root disk.
Insert it and wait for the prompt login: "Slackware login".
<P>To start the Slackware installation you must log in as root. Type
"root" at the prompt. Be aware that at the time of installation your
keyboard is still qwerty.
<H3>2a- Install PLIP module    </H3>

<P>Install your source computer according to Gilles' instructions, 
from chapter 7 to 9.    
<P>Install PLIP on the target.  To install the PLIP module you need to
launch the program from your PLIP disk.  Remember you did it, no !!!
<P>Access your floppy disk with:
<PRE>
          $ mount /dev/fd0h1440 /floppy
          $ cd /floppy
          $ insmod parport      # it will install your parallel port
          $ insmod parport_pc   # it will set it up
          $ insmod plip         # it will install plip module
    
</PRE>

If during the PLIP installation you encounter an error,  it means that
your parallel port has not been correctly installed. You may type again
the instruction above, it does work sometimes !!, or go to the parport 
directory and write the appropriate setting.
<PRE>
      $ cd /proc/parport/0
      $ vi IRQ            # Verify that 7 is written in it if you are using
                          # that interrupt'
     
</PRE>

See the chapter "PLIP on the source side" to get the proper setting.
<P>You should not bother too much as at 95% on the 5 laptops I have
installed everyting went smoothly.  (Comment peut-on avoir "95% de
cinq", said rational Graham)
<P>
<P>
<H3>3a- Now create your NFS drive.     </H3>

<P>From that point I have chosen to use the creation of a NFS drive
on the target computer. Then I will make an installation using the
"From directory" option rather than from nfs.
<P>Do not forget you still have a US keyboard layout.  Of course you
have set up your source according to chapter "Network parameters".
You did then ping your source, but you cannot yet ping the target.
<P>So the first step is to configure your PLIP connection:
On the target type:   
<A NAME="SLACKWARE_TARGET_IP_ADRESS_IFCONFIG"></A> <P>
<PRE>
       $ ifconfig plip0 192.168.0.1 pointopoint 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.255 up
      
</PRE>
 
<P>Test your Plip configuration by pinging the target from the source
<P>
<PRE>
     $ ping target
     
</PRE>

then mount  your nfs drive on the target:
<PRE>
     $ cd /
     $ mkdir nfstest
     $ mount -t nfs 192.168.0.2:/cdrom /nfstest
     
</PRE>

<I>You have just configured a drive linked to your source
directory /cdrom were you suppose to have the Slackware CDROM
connected, from your target directory called nfstest</I>.
<P>Now everything is set up and you are ready to launch the Slackware
installation program, by typing "setup".
<P><B>note:</B>if you do not have enough memory, below 8MB
setup will not be launched, then you will have to make a swap
space to allow the program to work.
First, create your disk partition with your swap by typing
<PRE>
       $ fdisk
      
</PRE>
<P>Note which is your swap partition (e.g. /hda3), then quit fdisk with
'w'. Once it's done, type:
<P>
<PRE>
       $ mkswap -c /dev/hda3
       $ swapon /dev/ha3
      
</PRE>
<P>Your swap is now set up.
You may then launch the "setup" program.
<P>
<H3>4a- Installing Slakware     </H3>

<P>the setup programm shows various menu items:
<UL>
<LI>HELP - Help file</LI>
<LI>KEYMAP - Keyboard select (Azerty at last !!!)</LI>
<LI>ADDSWAP - Create and select swap</LI>
<LI>TARGET - Select target</LI>
<LI>SOURCE - select the source</LI>
<LI>SELECT - Select packages to install</LI>
<LI>CONFIGURE - Set up your Linux system and make LILO</LI>
<LI>EXIT - bye bye setup </LI>
</UL>
<P>4b- Select your keyboard, for French take -Fr-latin1.map
<P>4c- Select your swap partition if not already configured
<P>4d- Select the target, default is '/' 
<P>4e- Select the source. tricky stuff: choose "Installing from a
drive", then type the drive so : /nfstest/slackware
<I>'/slackware' because your drive must point to your slackware
CDROM directory</I>
<P>4f- Select packages to install
<P>4g- Wait, Wait, Wait and Wait........
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss14.2">14.2 Caldera Installation</A>
    </H2>

<P>     
I told you that Caldera works also with that install. In fact, as 
Caldera automatically launches its Setup program, once you arrived
at the menu where you are supposed to choose your source disks, type
ALT F2, go to another screen, then log on as root and make your 
nfs drive as described above in points 2 to 4.
Then go back to the installation screen with ALT F1, and type 
the famous nfstest as your source directory. Caldera will then
install without problem.
<H2><A NAME="ss14.3">14.3 Troubleshooting</A>
    </H2>

<P>If you are experiencing any trouble with that installation you may
report it to me and I'll try to help as best as I can.
