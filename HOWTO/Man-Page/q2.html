>2. How are man pages accessed?</H1
><P
>You need to know the precise mechanism for acccessing man
pages in order to give your man page the right name and install it
in the right place. Each man page should be categorized in a
specific section, denoted by a single character. The most common
sections under Linux, and their human readable names, are:</P

>Section The human readable name
   1    User commands that may be started by everyone.
   2    System calls, that is, functions provided by the kernel.
   3    Subroutines, that is, library functions.
   4    Devices, that is, special files in the /dev directory.
   5    File format descriptions, e.g. /etc/passwd.
   6    Games, self-explanatory.
   7    Miscellaneous, e.g. macro packages, conventions.
   8    System administration tools that only root can execute.
   9    Another (Linux specific) place for kernel routine documentation.
   n    (Deprecated) New documentation, that may be moved to a more appropriate section.
   o    (Deprecated) Old documentation, that may be kept for a grace period.
   l    (Deprecated) Local documentation referring to this particular system.</PRE

>The name of the man page's source file (the input to the
formatting system) is the name of the command, function or file
name, followed by a dot, followed by the section character. If you
write the documentation on the format of the `passwd' file you
have to name the source file `passwd.5'. Here we also have an
example of a file name that is the same as a command name. There
might be even a library subroutine named passwd. Sectioning is the
usual way to resolve these ambiguities: The command description is
found in the file `passwd.1' and the hypothetical library
subroutine in `passwd.3'.</P
><P
>Sometimes additional characters are appended and the file
name looks for example like `xterm.1x' or `wish.1tk'. The
intent is to indicate that this is documentation for an X Window
program or a Tk application, respectively. Some manual browsers can
make use of this additional information. For example xman will use
`xterm(x)' and `wish(tk)' in the list of available
documentation.</P
><P
>Please don't use the n, o and l sections; according to
the File System Standard these sections are deprecated. Stick to
the numeric sections. Beware of name clashes with existing
programs, functions or file names. It is certainly a bad idea to
write yet another editor and call it ed, sed (for smart ed) or red
(for Rocky's ed). By making sure your program's name is
unique, you avoid having someone execute your program but read
someone else's man page, or vice versa.</P
><P
>Now we know the name to give our file. The next decision is
the directory in which it will finally be installed (say, when the
user runs `<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make install</TT
>' for your package.)
On Linux, all man pages are below directories listed in the
environment variable MANPATH. The doc-related tools use MANPATH in
the same way the shell uses PATH to locate executables. In fact,
MANPATH has the same format as PATH. Each contains a
colon-separated list of directories (with the exception that
MANPATH does not allow empty fields and relative pathnames -- it
uses absolute names only.) If MANPATH is not set or not exported, a
default will be used that contains at least the /usr/man directory.
To speed up the search and to keep directories small, the
directories specified by MANPATH (the so-called base directories)
contain a bunch of subdirectories named `man&#60;s&#62;' where
&#60;s&#62; stands for the one-character section designator
introduced in the <A
HREF="q2.html"
>table above</A
>. Not all of
the sections may be represented by a subdirectory because there
simply is no reason to keep an empty `mano' subdirectory.
However, there may be directories named `cat&#60;s&#62;',
`dvi&#60;s&#62;' and `ps&#60;s&#62;' which hold documentation
that is ready to display or print. More on this later. The only
other file in any base directory should be a file named
`whatis'. The purpose and creation of this file will also be
described under <A
HREF="q12.html"
>paragraph 12)</A
>. The
safest way to have a man page for section &#60;s&#62; installed in
the right place is to put it in the directory
/usr/man/man&#60;s&#62;. A good <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Makefile</TT
>, however,
will allow the user to chose a base directory, by means of a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make</TT
> variable, MANDIR, say. Most of the GNU
packages can be configured with the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--prefix=/what/ever</TT
> option. The manuals will
then be installed under the base directory /what/ever/man. I
suggest you also provide a way to do something similar.</P
><P
>With the advent of the Linux
File System Standard (FS-Stnd), things became more
complicated. [Note: the FS-Stnd appears to be replaced
by the <A
HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"
TARGET="_top"
>Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</A
>, FHS.] The FS-Stnd 1.2 states that</P
><P
>"Provisions must be made in the structure of /usr/man to
support manual pages which are written in different (or multiple)
languages."</P
><P
>This is achieved by introducing another directory level that
distinguishes between different languages. Quoting again from
FS-Stnd 1.2:</P
><P
>"This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/man is
based on Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes
the locale identification string -- the most well accepted method
to describe a cultural environment. The &#60;locale&#62; string is:
&#60;language&#62;[_&#60;territory&#62;][.&#60;character-set&#62;][,&#60;version&#62;]"</P
><P
>(See the FS-Stnd for a few common &#60;locale&#62; strings.)
According to these guidelines, we have our man pages in
/usr/man/&#60;locale&#62;/man[1-9lno]. The formatted versions should
then be in /usr/man/&#60;locale&#62;/cat[1-9lno] of course, otherwise
we could only provide them for a single locale. HOWEVER, I can not
recommend switching to that structure at this time. The FS-Stnd 1.2
also allows that</P
><P
>"Systems which use a unique language and code set for
all manual pages may omit the &#60;locale&#62; substring and store
all manual pages in &#60;mandir&#62;. For example, systems which only
have English manual pages coded with ASCII, may store manual pages
(the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>man[1-9]</TT
> directories) directly in /usr/man.
(That is the traditional circumstance and arrangement in
fact.)"</P
><P
>I would not switch until all tools (like xman, tkman, info
and many others that read man pages) can cope with the new
structure.</P
