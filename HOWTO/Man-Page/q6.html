>6. What preprocessors may I
use?</H1
><P
>Groff comes with at least three preprocessors,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tbl</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eqn</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pic</TT
> (on some systems they are named
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>geqn</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gpic</TT
>.) Their purpose is to translate
preprocessor macros and their data to regular troff input.
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Tbl</TT
> is a table preprocessor,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eqn</TT
> is an equations/maths preprocessor and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pic</TT
> is a picture preprocessor. Please refer to
the man pages for more information on what functionality they
provide. To put it in a nutshell: don't write man pages
requiring <EM
>any</EM
> preprocessor. Eqn will generally
produce terrible output for typewriter-like devices, unfortunately
the type of device 99% of all man pages are viewed on (well, at
least I do). For example, XAllocColor.3x uses a few formulas with
exponentiation. Due to the nature of typewriter-like devices, the
exponent will be on the same line as the base. N to the power of
two appears as `N2'. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Tbl</TT
> should be avoided
because all xman programs I have seen fail on them. Xman 3.1.6 uses
the following command to format man pages, e.g. signal(7):</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl /usr/man/man7/signal.7 | geqn | gtbl | groff
-Tascii -man /tmp/xmana01760 2&#62; /dev/null</TT
></P
><P
>which screws up for sources using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
>,
because <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
> output is fed again into
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
>. The effect is a man page without your
table. I don't know if it's a bug or a feature that
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
> chokes on its own output or if xman could
be a little smarter and not use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gtbl</TT
> twice.
Furthermore, some systems use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>grog</TT
> to determine
what options to pass to groff. Unfortunately grog sometimes guesses
wrong and recommends <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>groff -t</TT
> when in fact
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tbl</TT
> must not be used. We are basically left with
two workarounds for tables:</P

>Format the table yourself manually and put it between .nf and
.fi lines so that it will be left unformatted. You won't have
bold and italics this way but this beats having your table
swallowed any day.</P

>Use any <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tbl</TT
> macros you like but distribute
the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tbl</TT
> output instead of the input. There is
however this quirk with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>grog</TT
> who thinks that any
file containing a line starting with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.TS</TT
>
requires <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tbl</TT
>. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Tbl</TT
> output for
some reason unbeknownst to me still contains <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.TS</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.TE</TT
>. It seems you can simply remove them and
have the result still look okay. YMMV, so please test this with
your particular man page.</P
></LI

><P
>I have yet to see a man page requiring <TT

preprocessing. But I would not like it. As you can see above,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xman</TT
> will not use it and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>groff</TT
> will certainly do the funky wadakiki on
the input.</P
