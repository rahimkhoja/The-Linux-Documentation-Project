>The documentation included with your video adaptor should specify the
chipset used. If you are in the market for a new video card, or are
buying a new machine that comes with a video card, have the vendor
find out exactly what the make, model, and chipset of the video card
is. This may require the vendor to call technical support on your
behalf; in general vendors will be happy to do this. Many PC hardware
vendors will state that the video card is a ``standard SVGA card''
which ``should work'' on your system. Explain that your software
(mention Linux and XFree86!)  does not support all video chipsets and
that you must have detailed information.</P
><P
>You can also determine your videocard chipset by running the 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SuperProbe</B
> program included with the XFree86 distribution. 
This is covered in more detail below.</P
><P
>Supported video cards will work with all bus types, including ISA and
VLB and PCI.</P
><P
>One problem faced by the XFree86 developers is that some video card
manufacturers use non-standard mechanisms for determining clock
frequencies used to drive the card. Some of these manufacturers either
don't release specifications describing how to program the card, or
they require developers to sign a non-disclosure statement to obtain
the information. This would obviously restrict the free distribution
of the XFree86 software, something that the XFree86 development team
is not willing to do. For a long time, this has been a problem with
certain video cards manufactured by Diamond, but as of release 3.1 of
XFree86, Diamond has started to work with the development team to
release free drivers for these cards.</P
><P
>The suggested setup for XFree86 under Linux is a 486 or better with at
least 8 megabytes of RAM, and a video card with a chipset listed
above. For optimal performance, we suggest using an accelerated card,
such as an S3-chipset card. You should check the documentation for
XFree86 and verify that your particular card is supported before
taking the plunge and purchasing expensive hardware.</P
><P
>As a side note, the personal Linux system of Matt Welsh (this FAQ's
originator) was a 486DX2-66, 20 megabytes of RAM, equipped with a VLB
S3-864 chipset card with 2 megabytes of DRAM.  He ran X benchmarks on
this machine as well as on Sun Sparc IPX workstations.  The Linux
system was roughly 7 times faster than the Sparc IPX (for the curious,
XFree86-3.1 under Linux, with this video card, runs at around 171,000
xstones; the Sparc IPX at around 24,000). In general, XFree86 on a
Linux system with an accelerated SVGA card will give you much greater
performance than that found on commercial UNIX workstations (which
usually employ simple framebuffers for graphics).</P
><P
>Your machine will need at least 4 megabytes of physical RAM, and 16
megabytes of virtual RAM (for example, 8 megs physical and 8 megs swap).
Remember that the more physical RAM that you have, the less that the system
will swap to and from disk when memory is low. Because swapping is
inherently slow (disks are very slow compared to memory), having 8
megabytes of RAM or more is necessary to run XFree86 comfortably.  16 is
better.  A system with 4 megabytes of physical RAM could run
<EM
>much</EM
> (up to 10 times) more slowly than one with 8 megs
or more.</P
