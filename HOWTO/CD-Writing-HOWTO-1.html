<P>Many people use Linux to burn CD-ROMs, because it is reliable
and easy. No bluescreens while burning and no headaches about
getting the right combination of hard- and software. It just
works once properly set up. The CD-writing HOWTO explains the
setup,  how to put data on the media and gives some interesting
applications kindly submitted by the readers.

<P>As the editor of this document I mostly sum up what other people report to
me. I'm not a software developer nor an expert in hardware, so for
specific problems with hard- or software you may want to ask somebody else.
What always makes sense is to report solutions for problems not already
covered by the HOWTO to me.
<P>
<P>I get several hundred e-mails concerning the CD-Writing HOWTO each year.
So please be patient with me, as I cannot always answer within hours.
However, I read everything immediately and put you on my CDR-queue. Before
you ask a question, please make sure you are aware of the newest

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Suggested readings</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You may need the handbook for your Linux-distribution to learn about
installing a new kernel. I'm really clueless about this issue when
it comes to any other Linux distribution than my own.
<P>The 
<A HREF="http://www.fadden.com/cdrfaq/">CD-R FAQ</A>
is a general FAQ about compact-disk recordables (CD-R), CD-writers and
the required software.
As most CD-writers can be used to read CD-ROMs, too, you may want to read
the <I>Linux CD-ROM HOWTO</I>, the <I>Linux SCSI
HOWTO</I> and the <I>Linux Kernel HOWTO</I>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Terminology ... lasers at maximum ... fire!</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><I>CD-ROM</I> stands for <I>Compact Disc Read Only Memory</I>, a
storage medium utilizing an optical laser to sense microscopic pits on a
colorful shimmering disk. The pits represent the bits of the information
and are so petite that some billions of them fit on the
disc. Thus a CD is a mass-storage medium.
<P>The term <I>CD-R</I> is a short form of <I>CD-ROM recordable</I> and
refers to a CD that doesn't have those microscopic pits on its surface.
Thus it is empty. The CD-R has a special chemical film inside into which
pits can be burned. This is done by giving the laser which normally just
senses the pits a little bit more power so it burns the pits. This action
can only be taken <B>once</B> on a CD-R. You can leave out some
areas for later writing, creating a so called <I>multi-session CD</I>.
<P>The <I>CD-ROM rewritable</I> (short: <I>CD-RW</I>) was developed to
work around the limitation of CD-R media. With a CD-RW burner the laser
can do both, burn pits into the media and also melt the media back into
its original state. This is possible, because the laser does not really
burn holes into the media, which would get lost in a puff of smoke.
A decent analogy for the technique is an ice-hockey game: by
driving over the ice, a players (laser) leave scratches in
it. The pattern in the ice (media) is a recording of what
happened on the ice during one round.  In between the periods
of the game, the Zamboni cleaning car drives over the ice and
fills the scratches by melting the very top layer of the ice.
(Zamboni is <I>the</I> brand name for cleaning cars in
ice-hockey stadiums).  This way the pattern on the ice is
cleared and a new round can begin. The scientific term for
evaporating, condensing, melting and freezing is "phase
change", thus the name "phase change devices" for
CD-RW-writers.
<P>This HOWTO deals with the task of writing CD-Rs and CD-RWs.  Welcome on board,
captain.
<P>
<H3>Adaptor vs. Adapter</H3>

<P>The the most frequent spelling within the kernel sources is adapter
(adapter: 4283, adaptor: 154). Even more important, the parameters of
module options and aliases are naturally affected, like in
"scsi_hostadapter". So in order to achieve a consistent spelling throughout
configuration examples and document text, I follow that convention
regardless of the correct spelling.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Supported CD-writers</A>
</H2>

<P>USB CD-writers are currently not supported at all. Apart from that you can
safely assume that most newer IDE/ATAPI- and SCSI-writers work under
Linux. Newer drives are mostly MMC-compliant and are therefore supported. If
the SCSI-version of a particular writer works, the IDE/ATAPI-version will
most likely work and vice versa. However, some people want to get a warm
and fuzzy feeling by reading the exact model of their writer in some sort
of compatibility list.  That is the reason why I didn't throw the following
list out of the HOWTO.
Here is a comprehensive summary of drives reported to work with cdrecord:

<P>
<P>The detailed list of models which have been reported to work or not to work
under various Unix-like operating systems is available online from

<P>
<P>If your hardware isn't supported you can still use Linux to create an image
of the CD. You may wish to do so because most burning software for DOS does
not deal with RockRidge-extensions (Unix-like filesystems on CD-ROM). In a
second step, you can use DOS or Macintosh software to write the image to
the CD-R.

<P><CODE>cdwrite</CODE> is unmaintained software referenced only for
completeness. Please use <CODE>cdrecord</CODE> instead, as it
supports a wider range of hardware and has significantly
more features. The main benefit of cdrdao is the ability to create audio
CDs without two seconds of silence between the tracks (writing
in disk-at-once (DAO) mode).

<P>The most obvious difference between the ISO 9660 filesystem compared to the
ReiserFS or Extended-2 filesystem is: you can't modify files once they are
written.  Other limitations of the ISO-9660-filesystem include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> only 8 levels of sub-directories allowed (counted from
the top-level directory of the CD)</LI>
<LI> maximum length for filenames: 32 characters</LI>
<LI> 650 MB capacity</LI>
</UL>
<P><I>RockRidge</I> is an extension to allow longer filenames and a deeper
directory hierarchy for the ISO-9660 filesystem. When reading a CD-ROM with
RockRidge extensions under Linux, all the known properties of files like
owner, group, permissions, symbolic links appear ("feels like a Unix
filesystem").  These extensions are not available when reading the CD-ROM
under DOS or the heterogenous Windows-family of operating systems.
<P><I>El Torito</I> can be used to produce bootable CD-ROMs. For this feature
to work, the BIOS of your PC must support it. Roughly speaking, the
first 1.44 (or 2.88 if supported) Mbytes of the CD-ROM contains a
floppy-disk image supplied by you. This image
is treated like a floppy by the BIOS and booted from. (As a consequence,
while booting from this virtual floppy, your original drive A: (/dev/fd0)
may not be accessible.)
<P><I>HFS</I> lets a Macintosh read the CD-ROM as if it were an HFS volume
(the native filesystem for MacOS).
<P><I>Joliet</I> brings long filenames (among other things) to newer variants
of Windows (95, 98, NT). However, the author knows of no tool that allows long
filenames under plain DOS or Windows 3.11.
<P><I>Video-CDs</I> can be directly played on DVD-devices.
<P>Section 2.8 lists the availability of the mentioned software.
