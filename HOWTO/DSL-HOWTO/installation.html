><P
> You may or may not have a choice on how the installation is done, or who
 does it. This is totally at the discretion of the provider. In much of the
 world, this is done by the telco, and there is little flexibility. Many
 providers in the U.S. offer a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"self install"</SPAN
> option where you do
 all the work. In this scenario, the provider will send a kit in order to save
 them from sending a tech, and thus reducing cost. Typically, self install
 kits will include microfilters for the POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
 or ISDN (where ADSL over ISDN is used) phone jacks, the modem (and
 maybe a NIC), and a CDROM with drivers, etc. on it. In some cases, a splitter
 may be included instead of microfilters. In any case, some type of filtering
 is necessary on the non-DSL lines. If not the noise generated by the DSL
 signal may interfere with regula telco devices such as phones and answering
 machines.&#13;</P
><P
> The other possibility is for the provider to do the installation. Again, this
 may be your only option. Obviously, the cost is higher here, but it may have
 the advantage of having a trained tech do any wiring. There is also a better
 chance of getting a <SPAN

 (a good thing!). Another benefit is that if something is wrong with the line,

    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    line without dial-tone for DSL and Internet connectivity. Also, DSL
    services from CLECs (independent telcos like Covad), may use a
    dedicated line, depending on their line sharing agreement with the local 
    incumbent carrier. (Instead the CLEC will actually lease a loop from the
    ILEC.) On your end, this simply means using one of the unused wire pairs
    in the telco wire bundle, and connecting it to the DSL jack.

>   <EM
>Shared Line with Splitter</EM

   are provided over the same line as regular voice service, the signal
   must be filtered somehow so that voice services are not adversely effected.
   Installing a splitter splits the line into two pairs, and filters the DSL
   signal from one of them. This results in a inside wiring scheme where DSL
   goes to only one jack, and then regular voice type service to all other
   jacks. This is considered by many to be a better type of installation than
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"splitterless"</SPAN
>, i.e. with microfilters instead. See below.
  
  </P
><P
>   Splitters are available from various manufacturers and come in various
   shapes and sizes. Some are small enough to fit in the NID itself (sometimes
   called SNI, this is the telco phone box on the outside of your house),
   while others have a housing as large as the NID itself. Typically this is
   mounted near the NID, on the customer's side of the demarcation point.

  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   <EM
>Shared Line with Filters</EM
>. Again, for some DSLs that
   piggyback on the POTS (or ISDN) line, the signal must be filtered or split at some
   point. This is not necessary for g.lite or RADSL however. The other way of
   doing this is by placing RJ11 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"microfilters"</SPAN
> in each phone
   jack -- <EM
>except where the DSL modem will be</EM
>. These
   filters are relatively small, plug-in devices and remove the higher
   frequencies associated with DSL. This is obviously much easier since no
   tools or wiring is required. This is often what is included in self-install
   kits, and is often referred to as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"splitterless"</SPAN
>
   installation. This is a very common approach in the U.S. Note that 
   in areas where ADSL over ISDN is provided, filtering is required 
   also, but the filters themselves are quite different and are not
   interchangeable with POTS filters!
  </P
><P
>   Similar microfilters are sometimes used by some telcos to reduce the
   excessive <SPAN

   This is a little different approach as the filter is put on the same 
   jack as the modem.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   <EM
>Shared Line, Splitterless and Filterless</EM
>. Some newer
   DSLs, like G.Lite, have no adverse effect on regular POTS devices and thus
   require no filters or splitters. This would seem to be the wave of the
   future. Just plug and play. Though still not very common.

 may have electric motors, transformers, power supplies, high

 to go. And you are also less likely to have a failing microfilter
 cause problems -- one potential point of failure instead of several. You can
 also use a better grade of cable such as CAT 5.&#13;</P

 Microfilters also add to the effective loop length -- as much as 700 ft per

> The splitter will typically consist of two parts, the splitter and a small
 outdoor housing. Mount the splitter and accompanying housing per the telco's
 instructions at the Network Interface Device (NID) point (also sometimes
 called the SNI or ONI), usually the side of your house where the phone line
 is located. Put it on your side of the NID. The phone company may need
 to access the splitter for maintenance, so its advisable to locate it on the
 outside where they can get at it, but outside is not absolutely
 necessary.&#13;</P

 The wire bundle should have at least two separate wire pairs. The splitter
 takes one pair, and separates the signal onto two pairs. One pair in the
 bundle will then go to all phone jacks, and the other to the modem's DSL wall
 jack. So connect the incoming telco line to the LINE side of the splitter.
 Then wire the inside pair for your telephone to the VOICE, and your inside
 wire pair for the modem to DATA. &#13;</P

 Alarm systems can present various problems, depending on the type of alarm
 and how it is installed. This may require telco help for proper installation 
 so the one does not interfere with the other. Common microfilters tend not to
 work because most alarm boxes use a different size jack. Filters are now
 available just for alarm boxes, though traditionally this has been handled
 with a splitter type installation.</P

 green LED that lights up when the signal is good, and red or orange
 if not in sync. The modem's manual will have more details on the
 LEDs. If it doesn't sync, then check your wiring, or make sure that
 the DSL signal is being sent. Do this by calling your telco and
 verifying they have activated the service. Or by testing the modem at
 the test jack on the NID (see above). Note that having dial tone
 on the line does NOT confirm the presence of the DSL data signal. And
 vice versa -- perfectly possible to have dial tone and no DSL, or DSL
 and no dial tone. There should also be no static or noise on the
 voice line when everything is installed and functioning properly.&#13;</P

 There is no ethernet card necessary obviously. So connect the phone

 USB cable to the computer's USB port. </P
