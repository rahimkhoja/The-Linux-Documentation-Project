NAME="INTRO">1. Introduction</H1
><P
> DSL, or Digital Subscriber Loop, is a high-speed Internet access technology
 that uses a standard copper telephone line (a.k.a. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop"</SPAN
> in
 telco parlance). DSL provides a direct, dedicated connection to an ISP via
 the existing telco network. DSL is designed to run on up to 80% of the
 telephone lines available in the United States. By using line-adaptive
 modulation, DSL is capable of providing data speeds of 8 Mbps or more. &#13;</P
><P
> DSL services are now being aggressively marketed for home and small business
 use. DSL is typically priced below ISDN, and well below T1 service, yet can
 provide potentially even greater speeds than T1 without the
 cost, complexity, and availability issues of T1. Since DSL is a dedicated,
 often <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"always on"</SPAN
> service, it avoids the delays and use charges
 that are common with ISDN. Making this quite a nice technology for the
 bandwidth starved masses.&#13;</P
><P
> While all this sounds exciting, DSL does have some drawbacks. The quality of
 the DSL signal, and thus the connection, depends on distance (the length of
 the copper <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop"</SPAN
>) and various other factors. Also, there is no
 such thing as standard <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DSL"</SPAN
>. There are various flavors of DSL,
 and many, many ways DSL providers are implementing their networks. In typical
 fashion, Linux users are often left to fend for themselves, since the DSL
 providers are often taking the easy way out, and catering only to
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"mainstream"</SPAN
> Operating Systems.&#13;</P
><P
> The topics included in this HOWTO include qualification and pre-installation,
 installation, configuration, troubleshooting and securing a DSL connection. As
 well as other related topics. There are also appendices including a

 are hopefully addressed to one degree or another with what can be a complex
 topic since it deals with networking, hardware, new fangled technologies, and 
 various approaches taken by various vendors. The core components of this
 document are:

    card installation. 
       
   </P

    Security implications that are even more important with a full-time

    understand the finer points of this. And who wants to <SPAN

><P

 Removed the 'Linux Friendly ISP' section. The landscape has changed much
 since this section was started. Back then there were few options for DSL in
 many places, and all too often a non-compatible modem was the only thing
 available. Also, the advent of microfilters and self-installation has helped
 with the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"do-it-yourselfer"</SPAN
> approach, giving everybody more
 freedom. Then, maintaining this number of links was a PITA too. I still
 encourage new subscribers to shop their local markets if there are options.
 Many large ISPs and telcos have very poor ideas of what an Internet
 connection is and restrict severely what you can do with Linux. Or at least
 try to ;-) Updated LDP links to tldp.org (from linuxdoc.org).</P

 Minor update to PPPoE section, and two new Linux Friendly ISPs. A feeble 
 attempt to make the document a little less U.S.-centric. Various minor 
 updates.</P
><P
> Version 1.2 adds PPTP configuration section for Alcatel ethernet modems.
 Also, added are two additional sections in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Tuning"</SPAN
> section
 for the TCP Receive window, and ADSL/DMT interleaving. And the big news is
 the release of open source drivers for the Alcatel USB modem as of March
 2001. There is an Alcatel SpeedTouch USB mini HOWTO in the <A
HREF="speedtouchusb.html"
>appendix</A
> by Chris Jones. A number of 
 miscellaneous updates as well.
 
 </P
><P
> Version 1.1 included quite a few minor corrections, updates, 
 and additions. Not much that is substantially new. There are finally two
 Linux compatible DSL PCI modems from Xpeed. The drivers are now in the kernel
 2.2.18 source (not ported to 2.4 as of this writing 05/23/02).
 </P
><P
> Version .99 addresses some of the many changes that have occurred since the
 original ADSL mini HOWTO was published. Originally, ADSL was the primary DSL
 technology being deployed, but more and more some of the other DSL flavors
 are entering the picture -- IDSL, SDSL, G.Lite, and RADSL. Thus the renaming
 from <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ADSL mini HOWTO"</SPAN
> to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DSL HOWTO"</SPAN
>. There
 have been many other changes in DSL technology as well. PPPoE/A encapsulation
 has become more and more common as many ISPs are jumping on this bandwagon.

 that we will be using in this document, so that we are all on the same page.
 While many of the definitions below are not always 100% technically correct,
 they are close enough for our purposes here. In fast moving technologies like
 DSL, there are so many <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 difficult to say anything with any degree of certainty and have it stick. And

   This includes the ILECs (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers), a.k.a. the old
   guard phone companies or state run phone companies, and where the
   monopolies now have competition, the CLECs (Competitive Local Exchange
   Carriers), or independent providers such as Covad in the U.S.

   Traditionally this is a building where one end of your phone line
   physically terminates. The other end terminates at your home, office, or
   wherever. It will be used here to refer to the telco end termination point,
   regardless of whether it is a traditional Central Office building or
   another, smaller, remote structure or device.

   Essentially, you should think of your loop as one dedicated pair of copper
   wires that run uninterrupted from your residence or office directly to the
   CO. This is perhaps an oversimplification, but will serve our purposes. DSL
   availability, and signal quality, is tied directly to the characteristics
   of your physical line -- or <SPAN

   words, traditional, non-digital devices like analog phones, faxes and answering

   to piggy-back DSL. But certainly the most common in many places.
