NAME="AEN709">5.1.1. TCP Receive Window</H3
><P
> For many of us, a default Linux installation is going to give something close
 to optimum performance. Windows 9x users often get a big boost by increasing
 their TCP Receive Window (RWIN). But this is because it is too small to start
 with. This is just not the case with Linux where the default value is 32KB. &#13;</P
><P
> 
 The exception here is if you have to routinely deal with a high latency
 connection. For instance, if your provider has a satellite uplink that is
 consistently adding unusual latency (250ms or greater?). Then a larger
 TCP Window will likely help. For more on TCP Receive Window and related
 issues, look at <A
HREF="http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.psc.edu/networking/perf_tune.html</A
>. &#13;</P
><P
> The Receive Window is a buffer that helps control the flow of data. If 
 set too low, it can be a bottleneck and restrict throughput. The optimum 
 value for this depends completely on your bandwidth and latency. Latency being
 what you would find as average roundtrip time (RTT) based on
 <EM
>your</EM
> typical destinations and conditions. This can be
 determined with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ping</B
>. For example, the Linux default of
 32KB is acceptable up to speeds of 2 Mbps and a typical latency of 125ms or so,
 or 1.0 Mbps and latency of 250ms. Setting this value too high can also
 adversely effect throughput, so don't over do it.&#13;</P

NAME="AEN736">5.1.2. Interleaving</H3
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Interleaving"</SPAN
> is an error control mechanism of ADSL with DMT
 line encoding. DMT is now the standard for ADSL, and is by far and away the
 most prevalent form of ADSL. Interleaving buffers the raw data and corrects
 errors on the fly at the DSLAM. This can significantly help marginal loops
 that may be prone to line errors. The downside is that this buffering also adds
 significant latency to the connection. So for those with reasonable quality
 lines, interleaving is of no real benefit, and may actually add unnecessary 
 latency.&#13;</P
><P
> Interleaving is an adjustable parameter and can be turned on or off by the
 telco. Many telcos seem to like to have this on by default, since it probably 
 reduces tech support calls in those cases where it does help stabilize a line. 
 But everyone else pays a price. 
 </P
><P
> 
 How to know if your line is interleaved or not, and how to change it? Good
 question. Generally speaking, if your first hop or two on a traceroute is 
 less than 25ms or so, you can pretty much figure that interleaving is off. 
 But there may be other factors such as how far away those hops actually are.
 Unless your modem accurately reports this, the only other real way to know is
 to talk to someone at the telco. This may prove easier said than done.&#13;</P

> DSL connections may suffer performance degradations under certain
 circumstances. Thankfully, Linux has very robust and flexible networking
 tools to help us deal with these.</P
><P
> One such common situation is where traffic bottlenecks are created whenever
 data from a fast network segment hits a slower one. Such as ethernet hitting
 a DSL modem/router. This can cause short term traffic backlogs, known as
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"queues"</SPAN
> in the device. Queuing can result in degraded
 performance, particularly for interactive protocols (like telnet or ssh) and
 streaming protocols (like RealAudio), and increased latency for ICMP and
 other network protocols. This is most evident when the upstream link is
 saturated (since downstream data is queued at the ISP's end and we can't do
 as much about that). The queued traffic is processed such that lower volume
 traffic protocols (like ssh) often get drowned out so to speak, by the higher
 volume, bulk traffic (like http or ftp), as there isn't any special
 prioritizing in default usage. 
 </P
><P
> And if the upstream queuing, or other factors, causes enough of a delay, it
 can even decrease downstream bandwidth utilization by slowing the
 ACKnowledgements (which are heading upstream), that are required to keep a
 download moving at optimal rates. So it is possible that an upload can hurt
 a simultaneous download.&#13;</P
><P
> Such effects can be largely mitigated with Linux's built-in traffic 
 shaping abilities. The user space tool for manipulating the kernel's
 advanced traffic routing features is <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>iproute</SPAN

 sometimes packaged as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>iproute2</SPAN

 tools that can classify and prioritize traffic with a considerable degree of
 flexibility. It also requires various kernel config options to be turned on.
 And is also fairly close to Black Magic ;-) The definitive document on this

NAME="AEN758">5.1.4. Dropped PPP Connections</H3
><P
> PPPoE and PPPoA both rely on the venerable PPP protocol. This 
 protocol incorporates the Link Control Protocol (LCP), which is used to
 maintain the viability of the connection. Each end can send LCP echoes to other
 end, and if there is no response in the alloted time frame, the session is
 presumed dead, and is torn down. Again, either end can initiate this process.
 The client should then negotiate a new connection. But, this normally means a
 new IP address is assigned along with the new session. &#13;</P
><P
> Perhaps this is undesirable? While you certainly can't control what happens on
 the remote end in this regard, you can adjust PPP's very flexible way of
 dealing with LCP echoes on your end, to increase the number of echoes, extend
 the interval and timeout period on your end. This might help prolong the life
 of an unstable connection in situations with marginal line conditions, or a
 buggy peer on the other end. Read your client's documentation. YMMV.&#13;</P

 you can do about this.&#13;</P

    this works, there is probably something wired incorrectly inside, or a
    short in a connection somewhere, or there is severe electrical
    interference on the DSL line. Double check the splitter and wall jack

 For instance, a poor inside wire connection may result in retransmissions of
 packets that have been dropped. This can really reduce throughput and slow a
 connection down. It is tempting to think of packet loss as a traditional
 networking problem, but with DSL it is possible to be the result of a bad
 line, impaired signal, or even the modem itself.

>   RFI Bear-hunt: The DSL signal is fragile. There are a number of
   things that can degrade it.  RFI, or Radio Frequency Interference,
   from sources in and around the home/office is one common source of
   reduced signal strength, intermittent sync loss, low
   sync rates and high line error rates that can cause retransmissions and 
   slow things down. DSL frequencies just happen to be in a range that is 
   susceptible to many potential RFI sources. Our test tool here is simply a
   portable AM radio. Tune it to any channel where you can get clear reception
   -- it makes no difference where. The AM radio will pick up RFI that is in
   the same frequency range as the DSL signal. It will sound like
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"frying bacon"</SPAN
> type static. Put it against your computer's
   power supply. You should hear some static. Move it away and the static
   should fade pretty quickly. This will give you an idea of what RFI sounds
   like. A decent quality power supply should produce only weak RFI --
   probably not enough to cause a problem. Use the radio like a Geiger counter
   and move it around your modem and DSL line. If you hear static, follow it
   to the source. Things to be suspicious of: power supplies, transformers,
   ballasts, electric motors, dimmer switches, high intensity lighting. Moving
   the modem, or rerouting cables is sometimes enough. Keeping the line
   between the modem and the wall jack as short as possible is a good idea
   too.

    Sometimes it is something as simple as a bad splice or corroded jack, and
    easily remedied if it can be found. Most such conditions can be isolated
    by a good telco tech. Check with your provider, and politely harass them
    if you have to. If you get the run-around, ask to go over their heads.

 Then, any time you hit the Internet, there is some slight degradation of
 performance with each hop you take. Now this may not amount to much, as long
 as you are not taking too many hops and all the components -- your system,
 your ISP's network, your ISP's upstream provider, and the destination itself
 -- are all working like well oiled machines. But there's the rub -- how do
 you really know with so many variables in the mix? One flaky interface, on
 one router, on one hop along the path, may cause misleading results.&#13;</P
><P

 excellent place to run your own tests. (Run a traceroute though just to see
 how local it really is.) </P

 If your ISP does not have this, look for an ftp site that is close -- the
 fewer the hops, the better. And look for one that isn't too busy, or you will
 get misleading results. Find a large file -- like 10 Megs -- and time the
 download. Try this over several days, and at different times of day. The
 server, and the backbone, are going to be busier at certain times of day,
 which can skew results and you want to eliminate these variables as much as
 possible. Your provider cannot compensate for heavy backbone traffic,
 backbone bottlenecks, slow or busy servers, etc. &#13;</P

> Now keeping in mind that we are limited by the ~10-20% networking overhead rule,
 here is an example. My speed is capped at 1472 Kbps sync rate. Minus the ~15%
 is 1275 Kbps. My sync rate is known to be good and my distance to the CO is
 about 11,000 Ft, which is close enough that I should be able to hit my real
 world maximum throughput of 1275 Kbps or roughly 1.2-1.3 Mbps -- all other
 things being equal. From dslreports.com speed test:

> 1.211 Mbps is probably about as good as I can realistically expect based on
 my service. There is no reason for me to go troubleshooting or looking for
 tweaks.  &#13;</P

> <EM
>Big Caution</EM
>: my ISP uses a caching proxy server for
 web pages. This is a big equalizer for these kinds of web based
 tests. Without that, I surely would have been significantly slower on this
 test. The effect of the proxy is that you are actually testing throughput
 from the proxy -- NOT the test site. Just FYI. Another note: at the same time
 I tried another test site and was consistently getting 600-700 Kbps. So YMMV
 with these tests. (Usually I get the same on each, more or less.) Timing a
 large ftp download from two different sites, I calculated about 1.25 Mbps. &#13;</P
