><P
>    Q. Does DSL work with Linux?
  </P
><P
>   DSL is a technology, or more correctly, a group of related technologies.
   This is akin to asking if Linux works with telephones. The technology
   itself does not care. So, the short answer is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Yes, of
   course!"</SPAN
>. The long answer is that if there are any impediments, they
   are being imposed by the provider. There are things they may do, that can
   make getting Linux up and running, more of a challenge than it needs to be.
   Not having a compatible modem option available is one common gotcha. Also,
   if the telco or ISP is doing the installation, they may require a Windows
   or Mac system to be available. This saves them the costs of training their
   techs on various alternative OSes. Buyer beware!

  </P
><P
>   Basically all DSL does, is facilitate a high speed Internet connection. At
   some point, it is all TCP/IP, and Linux, of course, handles TCP/IP quite
   well.

  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   Q. Where can I find drivers for my PCI (or USB) modem?
  </P
><P
>    With a few exceptions, you probably can't, because they are just not
    available. Your best bet is an external, ethernet interfaced modem for all
    intents and purposes. If your provider does not offer one, you will have
    to find another provider, or buy your own modem outright. Just make sure
    it is compatible with your provider's flavor of DSL.
   </P
><P
>    The are exceptions to every rule. See the <A
HREF="appendix.html#MODEMS"
>Modems
    Section</A
> for a list of compatible modems as of this writing.
 
   </P
><P
>    If an incompatible modem puts you in a bind, hopefully you will take the
    time to politely harass the manufacturer  ;-).
    
   </P
><P
>    This situation is changing for the better. <A
HREF="http://www.xpeed.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Xpeed</A
> now has drivers included in the
    kernel for source for their PCI IDSL and SDSL modems. This is good news!
    <A
HREF="http://www.alcateldsl.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Alcatel</A
> has 
    released drivers for the Alcatel SpeedTouch USB ADSL modem. IteX has 
    also released drivers for their PCI ADSL modem. Hopefully
    more will follow suit. (Make sure you are reading the latest version of
    this document, as I have intentions of keeping this situation updated as
    needed.)
   
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Q. How fast or good of a network card do I need?
   </P
><P
>     Any card that is compatible with Linux should work fine. Remember even
     low-end cards are 10 Mbps, and no consumer class DSL is near that at this
     time. I would suggest a reasonably good quality card, just to help
     eliminate the possibility of errors and premature failure.
     
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. How can I find out when DSL will be available in my area?
  </P
><P
>   Just where and when DSL gets deployed is totally in the hands of
   your friendly local telco. They obviously can't do everyone at
   once, so they probably are selecting areas based on competitive
   factors. Getting a straight answer from a telco on this question
   can also be a challenge.  Probably so as not to tip their hand to
   competitors. Unfortunately, it is a question only they can answer.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. I was disqualified because I am too far away. What can I do?
  </P
><P
>   Move? Seriously, there isn't much you can do. If there are other providers, 
   get another opinion. You never know. Determining the loop length is an
   inexact science, and there is room for errors. Many use databases for
   this, and these databases routinely have some inaccuracies. Some providers
   too, may be more aggressive in taking steps to help you out and clean up
   the line. Also, some providers offer low-end speed services that have
   greater reach. Maybe this will become available in your area. Or, the telco
   may install, at some point, remote devices for customers who are now too
   far away. 
  
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. I am told I am 20,000 ft from the CO. Isn't that too far? Will my 
    speeds be really bad?
  
  </P
><P
>    Not necessarily. This distance limitation is not where the CO is, but 
    where the DSLAM is. These are often installed in CO's, but more and more 
    are being installed in remote locations in order to expand the reach 
    of DSL service.
    
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. What are the speed tweaks for Linux?
  </P
><P
>   This may not be necessary. Linux is pre-tweaked for the most part,
   unlike some versions of Windows that really need some registry hacks to get
   optimum performance. If you have a high latency connection, you may 
   benefit from increasing the TCP Receive Window. See the <A
HREF="tuning.html"
>Tuning</A
> section. 
  </P
><P
>   Now if you are convinced you are not getting the performance you should
   based on your distance and line conditions, then there might be a problem
   somewhere. See the <A
HREF="tuning.html"
>Troubleshooting</A
> section for
   more. What you may need is a fix, more than a tweak.
   
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. My service is limited to 640K (for example). Can I get better speed by
    getting a faster modem? Any way around this?
  </P
><P
>   No, and no. The modem has little bearing on how fast your connection is for
   all intents and purposes. The provider has a mechanism in place for
   limiting your speed somewhere in the pipe before you hit the Internet.
   There is no way to defeat this.
  
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. Can I download and upload at the same time? Is one effected by the
    other?
  </P
><P
>    The upstream and downstream channels use separate frequency ranges within 
    the DSL signal, so simultaneous upload/download is not a problem and 
    available bandwidth is not normally impacted.
  </P
><P
>    Where there may be somewhat of an adverse impact, is with asymmetric DSLs
    like ADSL, <EM
>and</EM
> both the upstream and downstream are
    simultaneously saturated. This is a TCP 'feature' and not DSL related
    though. This can adversely effect the faster stream (i.e. the downstream).
    How much of an impact depends on a slew of factors and is beyond the scope
    of this document, but is more pronounced with higher ratios of downstream
    to upstream (e.g. 640/90). See the <A
HREF="tuning.html#BOTTLENECKS"
>Tuning</A
>
    on how to mitigate this effect.

  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   Q. I am paying for 768 Kbps service, and the best I ever get is 640 Kbps or
   so. Why? Is the service oversold? I am not getting what I pay for.
  </P
><P
>   You will lose 10-20% of the rated capacity due to the overhead inherent 
   in the various protocols utilized. Most of us will probably fall closer to
   20%. This is just a fact of life for everybody. Just how much is lost here
   depends on various factors. You seem to be close to your maximum when this
   is taken into consideration. Also, if you read the fine print, many ISPs
   are advertising speeds <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"up to"</SPAN
> such and such. Check your
   service agreement and see if there are any guarantees. If there are, they
   may be well below the advertised maximum speed, and may be based on sync
   rate instead of actual throughput. Though this may vary from provider to
   provider as well. 
   
  </P
><P
>   Also, be careful how you test this. Some of the so-called test sites can be
   pretty unreliable. There can be many factors between you and that site that
   can impact your throughput and skew results -- not the least of which is
   how many people might be trying that same test at the same time. The best 
   test is via FTP download from a known good, close, not too busy site.

  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   Q. Can DSL work with ISDN, and how is this different? 
  </P
><P
>   Yes, there have been DSL capable modems and service providers for some
   time. In fact, this is common in parts of Europe. So this is not an issue.
  </P
><P
>   What makes ISDN different is the underlying signal on the line is
   fundamentally different than a POTS line. This means that any physical
   layer hardware has to be compatible with ISDN (and conversely it is
   incompatible with POTS lines). So this means the NT (modem), filters, etc,
   all have to be designed for ISDN. Other than these low level issues, the
   other aspects of DSL implementation are the same (e.g. network protocols).
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. Why does PPPoX have such a bad rap?
  </P
><P
>    The occasional disconnects is one of the biggest gripes. PPP seems to be 
    sensitive to any interruptions in the connection. Generally a disconnect
    means a new IP. And there are those that say PPP, by its very nature, was
    never meant to be an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"always on"</SPAN
> protocol. PPP is a session
    management protocol at heart, that requires a user to initiate a
    connection and authenticate him or herself. PPPoE/A are not yet
    particularly mature protocols either. They do not have much of a history
    or track record. Some would say the telcos and hardware manufacturers have
    rushed this out the door. PPPoE also requires an additional layer of
    software just to maintain the connection. This is one more layer of code
    and one more potential point of failure. Also, more system overhead is
    utilized to manage the connection.
    
   </P
><P
>    The impact of the disconnect problem can potentially be eased by adjusting 
    the PPP LCP-echo settings to extend the period before the local end of 
    the connection decides to terminate the session. Each end of the
    connection uses LCP echoes to make sure the other end is still 
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"there"</SPAN
>. Nothing much can be done if the remote end decides
    to tear down a session (other than to do what you can to make sure you are
    responding to it's LCP echoes).

   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. Why PPPoX? This seems like a bad idea!
  </P
><P
>   PPP gives several advantages to the provider: they can use their existing
   infrastructure and hardware that they now use for their (larger) dialup
   customer base. It is easier to control user authentication and potential
   abuse situations, and easier to manage their network and related issues. In
   fact, it most boils down to its just easier for them. Easier, means saves
   man hours, and therefore saves costs (at least from their perspective).
  
  </P
><P
>   It is not a conspiracy to conserve IP addresses, or thwart heavy users. IP
   address costs are insignificant in the overall scheme of things.

>    Q. The only provider in my area does not support Linux. What can I do?
    Will I have to use Windows?
  </P
><P
>   NO! <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Support"</SPAN
> here is support as in <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"tech

   support when and if you have problems. This does not mean you cannot use
   Linux on their network. Just that you may have to fend for yourself when
   and if a problem does arise. Anything that is forbidden will be in their
   Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), or Terms of Service (TOS) agreement.
   
  </P
><P
>   I have heard stories where a new tech or installer has misinterpreted their
   own company's policy on this and told someone <SPAN

   individual.
 
  </P

   onto a Linux box. Hopefully, they will have a self-install option to get
   around this annoyance. YMMV.

>    Q. My fax software does not work with my DSL modem. Why is that?
  
  </P
><P

    the fax machine on the other end. Analog modems can handle this, but 
    DSL <SPAN

><LI
><P
>    Q. What does <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"FastPath"</SPAN
> mean? Is it better? Faster? What is
    interleaving? How can I get better ping times?

  </P
><P
>   Interleaving is a feature of DMT line encoding. Essentially it is a form 
   of error correction that is configurable at the DSLAM. The side effects are
   a slower connection, especially higher latency. With FastPath (or sometimes 
   called non-interleaved) DMT, gateway pings can be in the 10-25 ms range. With 
   interleaving, this is more likely to be in the 40-75 ms range depending on 
   the degree of interleaving that has been enabled.
   
  </P
><P
>   On the positive side, a marginal line is more stable and less prone to
   errors with interleaving. Many telcos have interleaving on by default since
   increased stability would seem to be a good thing. But this is only
   beneficial for marginal lines, and everyone else is paying a latency tax
   for this. Some telcos may be amenable to turning this feature on/off. YMMV.

><LI
><P
>    Q. How fast and powerful of a computer do I need for DSL? My ISP says I
    need at least a Pentium 200. Why?
  </P
><P
>    At the most basic level, a 386 will work fine. In most situations, you are
    connected to what is essentially an ethernet based network. So
    theoretically anything that can handle a very slow ethernet connection
    would work. No comment on how well Netscape will run on a 386 though ;-)
    But as far as just managing a raw connection, a 386 is indeed workable.
    What else you can do with it, is another matter.
    
  </P
><P
>    Where this gets a little more complicated is the modem, and the client
    that the ISP may require. Any PCI or USB modem is going to require
    drivers, which means more CPU and system resources. Also, PPPoE does even
    more processing, so again the potential CPU load is increased. Windows
    tends to be not so efficient with all this going on, hence the requirement
    for mid range Pentiums by some ISPs.
    
  </P
><P
>   With Linux it will depend on what you are going to do. A low end Pentium
   should be fine for most uses. A 386/486 should do nicely for just a
   firewall/gateway box in most situations. Just remember if you are running
   PPPoE, you may take a performance hit on low end hardware. 
 
  </P
></LI

><P
>    Q. I just got my DSL installed, and my speed sucks, and/or my connection
    constantly drops. What is the problem?
  
  </P
><P
>    Not enough information to say, really. There are many, many things that
    can cause a poor connection. The list is too long to mention them all.
    
  </P
><P
>    One of DSL's weaknesses is that the signal can be fairly fragile. Many
    things can degrade the signal, making for poor connections, and thus
    speed. This can be caused by poor or substandard inside wiring, a wiring
    problem outside (like bad splice), RFI from any number of sources, AM
    radio signal interference from a nearby station, bridge taps on your
    line, excessive distance from the DSLAM and so on. Not to mention possible
    hardware problems with your modem, NIC, or the telco's DSLAM, etc. Not
    always easy to sort out.
 
  </P
><P
>   Your provider should be able to assist you. First, make sure the problem
   isn't with your setup as they likely won't help solve a Linux problem. Then
   be persistent, and don't hesitate to go over someone's head if the help is
   not forthcoming. Most problems are solvable. The trick is isolating it. A
   good telco tech, trained for DSL, can find all kinds of obscure wiring
   problems. 
  
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. My provider's tech support staff is clueless. What can I do?
  
  </P
><P
>    Common complaint. Seems to be the nature of the beast. First line tech 
    support is an entry level position, and mostly filled by young people 
    with little technical or networking knowledge. Grin and bear it, or try 
    calling back.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. Now that I have a dedicated line, do I really need an ISP?
    Can't I be my own ISP?
  </P
><P
>   Yes, and no. Linux has everything needed to run a small ISP. But even
   though the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"line"</SPAN
> is a dedicated connection, it is only
   dedicated to the telco end-point equipment. You still need someone to sell
   you bandwidth, and gateway access to the Internet. So, traditional ISPs
   still have their role. You might see if there is a local provider of some
   kind that will just sell you the bandwidth without all the frills (e.g.
   email and news). But this probably will not save any costs.
  </P
><P
>   It is also technically possible to connect two DSL modems via 
   a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dry"</SPAN
> copper line. In some areas, a dry line (with 
   no dial tone), is fairly inexpensive (but in others areas it's not).
   And then you need someone on the other end who is willing to provide 
   the bandwidth and whatever services may be needed. Not all DSL modems
   support this (some common SDSL modems apparently do). This is also going to
   require dealing with the local phone company for something that is not a
   consumer type service (read: might be a real PITA). There is also a 
   significant start up investment, that may not come with any telco 
   guarantees for the intended use.

  </P

   Multi-Tone (DMT) (ANSI T1.413) in their current roll-out.  Most others
   should follow their lead in the states. There are other types of modems, most
   notably Carrier-less Amplitude Phase Modulation (CAP), which of course, is
   incompatible with DMT.

  </P

   version) has a ATM Forum 25Mbps interface,  which connects to a PCI ATM
   card. But this is rarely done in practice since many Operating Systems 
   can't speak ATM natively, and the cost of ATM cards is more than ethernet.

><LI
><P
>   Q: Why does DSL have all these bit rates (384/1.5/7.1M/20M/etc) options?
  </P
><P
>   The basic problem is the 100 year old design of the copper loop. It works
   great for analog phone, but it presents a real challenge for higher 
   performance signals like DSL. Remember that the distance of a loop is
   inversely proportional to the data rate that it can carry. Rate adaptive
   technologies are great for making a digital signal work in many situations,
   but it can't provide a consistent bandwidth for all applications,
   especially for very long (over ~15,000 ft) loops. The different bandwidths
   that you see advertised reflect various marketing battles of vendors
   equipment, and the telco struggle to finalize on a standard set of data
   rates. The bottom line is for the telco to be able to reach as broad a
   customer base as possible.
   
  </P
><P
>   Check out the next question on the loop impairments that cause this to
   happen.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   Q: What are all these loop impairments (bridge taps, load coils, DLCs) that
   could disqualify my line from DSL? (thanks to Bruce Ediger) 
  </P
><P
>   Load coils: in-line inductances that improve voice-frequency transmission
   characteristics of a telephone circuit.  Essentially, a "load" steals energy
   from high frequencies and gives it to lower frequencies.  Typically only used
   in very long (&#62; 9,000 ft) phone lines.
  </P
><P
>   By "bridges" I assume you mean "bridged taps".  In older neighborhoods, the
   phone wiring will have been used by more than one customer.  Perhaps these
   customers lived at different (though near-by) addresses.  The unconnected
   "spur" of wiring is a "bridged tab" on the currently connected circuit.
  </P
><P
>   DLCs, Digital Loop Carriers: there's a bunch of systems for carrying more
   than one voice transmission on a single pair of wires.  You can shift the
   frequencies up or down, or you can digitize the voice transmissions and
   divide the telephone circuit by time or code or something.  The more
   general term is "pair gain".
  </P
><P
>   These things cause different problems for high-frequency communications.
  </P
><P
>   Load coils will completely mess up things by filtering high frequencies and
   passing low frequencies.  They probably also change the "delay envelope",
   allowing some frequencies to arrive before others.  One byte's tones will
   interfere with the next byte's.
  </P
><P
>   Bridged taps act as shunt capacitances if they're long in relation to the
   signals wavelength, and they'll actually act as band pass filters if they're
   about 1/4 wavelength of the signal.  That is, they'll pass particular
   frequencies freely.  Particular tones of a DMT modem might get shunted back,
   rather than passed along to the receiving modem, reducing bandwidth for that
   telephone line.
  </P
><P
>   Pair gain, digital or analog, limit the bandwidth available to one
   transmission in order to multiplex several on one wire.  High and low tones
   of a DMT transmission get filtered out by the apparatus.
  </P
><P
>   The book "Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook", by Whitham D.
   Reeve, , IEEE Press 1992, ISBN 0-87942-274-2 covers the math of how to
   calculate the effect of line length, bridged tap, etc on the transmission
   characteristics of a telephone line.  It's pretty expensive, however.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Q. Can I run a web server with my DSL connection?
  
  </P
><P
>   Sure. You are connected to a TCP/IP network, so theoretically you can run 
   any service that the protocols allow -- mail, ftp, ssh, irc, etc. Where
   there may be problems, is with the ISP's TOS (Terms of Service). Some ISPs
   are pretty open on this, while others forbid any type of server, and may
   even block certain ports. You should research this, or ask the ISP before
   making any plans. ISPs that are selling a consumer service are not
   going to allow any high volume servers -- just personal, or low traffic
   services at best. If this does not fit the bill, then you can check with 
   any local Business class DSL providers. This will cost more, but the 
   Terms of Service, and guarantees, are generally much more suited to 
   higher bandwidth usages.
