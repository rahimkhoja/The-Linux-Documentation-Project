><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> makes an <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT

system call to load the LKM into kernel memory.  Loading it is the
easy part, though.  How does the kernel know to use it?  The answer is
that the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
> system call invokes the
LKM's initialization routine right after it loads the LKM.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> passes to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
>
the address of the subroutine in the LKM named
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
> as its initialization routine.</P
><P
>(This is confusing -- every LKM has a subroutine named
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
>, and the base kernel has a system
call by that same name, which is accessible via a subroutine in the
standard C library also named <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
>).</P
><P
>The LKM author set up <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
> to call a
kernel function that registers the subroutines that the LKM contains.
For example, a character device driver's
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
> subroutine might call the kernel's
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>register_chrdev</TT
> subroutine, passing the major and
minor number of the device it intends to drive and the address of its
own "open" routine among the arguments.
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>register_chrdev</TT
> records in base kernel tables
that when the kernel wants to open that particular device, it should
call the open routine in our LKM.</P
><P
>But the astute reader will now ask how the LKM's
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
> subroutine knew the address of the
base kernel's <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>register_chrdev</TT
> subroutine.  This
is not a system call, but an ordinary subroutine bound into the base
kernel.  Calling it means branching to its address.  So how does our
LKM, which was not compiled anywhere near the base kernel, know that
address?  The answer to this is the relocation that happens at
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> time.</P
><P
>How that relocation happens is fundamentally different between Linux
2.4 and Linux 2.6.  In 2.6, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

> pretty much just
passes the verbatim contents of the LKM file (.ko file) to the kernel
and the kernel does the relocation.  In 2.4, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

the relocation and passes a fully linked module image, ready to stuff
into kernel memory, to the kernel.  <EM

>10.6. Debugging Symbols</H2
><P
>There is another kind of symbol that relates to an LKM: kallsyms
symbols.  These are not exported symbols; they do not show up in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>proc/ksyms</TT
>.  They refer to addresses in the
kernel that are nobody's business except the module they are in, and
are not meant to be referenced by anything except a debugger.  Kdb,
the kernel debugger that comes with the Linux kernel, is one user of
kallsyms symbols.</P
><P
>The kallsyms facility works for both the base kernel and LKMs.  For the
base kernel, you select it when you build the base kernel, with the 
CONFIG_KALLSYMS configuration option.  When you do that, the kernel
contains a kallsyms symbol for all the symbols in the base kernel
object files.  You know your base kernel is participating in the kallsyms
facility if you see the symbol <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>__start___kallsyms</TT
>
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/ksyms</TT
>.</P
><P
>For an LKM, you decide at load time whether it will contain kallsyms
symbols.  You include the kallsyms definitions in the data you pass to
the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>init_module</TT
> system call to load the LKM.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> does this if either 1) you specify the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--kallsyms</TT
> option, or 2) <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
>
determines, by looking at <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/ksyms</TT
>, that the
base kernel is participating in the kallsyms facility.  The kallsyms that
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> defines are all the symbols in the LKM
object file.  To wit, those are the symbols you see when you run
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nm</B
> on the LKM object file.</P
><P
>Each loaded LKM that is participating in kallsyms has its own kallsyms
symbol table.  When the base kernel is participating in the kallsyms
facility, the individual LKM kallysms symbol tables are linked into a
master symbol table so that a debugger can look up a symbol anywhere
in the kernel.  When the base kernel is not participating in kallsyms,
a debugger must look explicitly at a particular LKM to find symbols
for that LKM.  Kdb, for one, cannot do this.  So the basic rule is: If
you're going to do any kernel debugging, use CONFIG_KALLSYMS.</P
><P
>Note that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>__kallsyms</TT
> section has nothing to do
with LKMs.  That's a section in the base kernel object module.  The
base kernel doesn't have the luxury of something as high-level as
sophisticated as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> to load it, so it needs
that extra object file section to facilitate its participation in
kallsyms.</P
><P
>Similarly, the program <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>kallsyms</B
> has nothing to do with
LKMs.  It is what creates the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>__kallsyms</TT
> section.</P
><P
>There is another kind of debugging symbol -- the kind that
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc</B
> creates with its <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-g</TT
> option.
These are unrelated to the kallsyms facility.  They do not get loaded
into kernel memory.  Kdb does not use them.  But Kgdb (which gets
information both from kernel memory and source and object files) does.</P

>10.7. Memory Allocation For Loading</H2
><P
>This section is about how Linux allocates memory in which to load an LKM.
It is not about how an LKM dynamically allocates memory, which is the same
as for any other part of the kernel.</P
><P
>The memory where an LKM resides is a little different from that where
the base kernel resides.  The base kernel is always loaded into one
big contiguous area of real memory, whose real addresses are equal to
its virtual addresses.  That's possible because the base kernel is the
first thing ever to get loaded (besides the loader) -- it has a wide
open empty space in which to load.  And since the Linux kernel is not
pageable, it stays in its homestead forever.</P
><P
>By the time you load an LKM, real memory is all fragmented -- you
can't simply add the LKM to the end of the base kernel.  But the LKM
needs to be in contiguous virtual memory, so Linux uses
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>vmalloc</TT
> to allocate a contiguous area of virtual
memory (in the kernel address space), which is probably not contiguous
in real memory.  But <EM
>the memory is still not
pageable</EM
>.  The LKM gets loaded into real page frames from
the start, and stays in those real page frames until it gets unloaded.</P
><P
>This design is based on the principle that it's much easier to get a
large contiguous area of virtual memory than to get a large contiguous
area of real memory because there is orders of magnitude more virtual
address space than real memory.  In the early days of virtual memory,
that was certainly true -- a 32 bit machine had a 4GiB virtual address
space and rarely more than 64 MiB of real memory.  Now, however, it's
quite often just the reverse, with virtual address space being the
constrained resource.  So this LKM loading strategy may not make sense
on your system.</P
><P
>Some CPUs can take advantage of the properties of the base kernel to 
effect faster access to base kernel memory.  For example, on one 
machine, the entire base kernel is covered by one page table entry
and consequently one entry in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
Naturally, that TLB entry is virtually always present.  For LKMs on
this machine, there is a page table entry for each memory page into
which the LKM is loaded.  Much more often, the entry for a page is not
in the TLB when the CPU goes to access it, which means a slower access.</P
><P
>This effect is probably trivial.</P
><P
>It is also said that PowerPC Linux does something with its address
translation so that transferring between accessing base kernel memory
to accessing LKM memory is costly.  I don't know anything solid about
that.</P
><P
>The base kernel contains within its prized contiguous domain a large
expanse of reusable memory -- the kmalloc pool.  In some versions of
Linux, the module loader tries first to get contiguous memory from
that pool into which to load an LKM and only if a large enough space
was not available, go to the vmalloc space.  Andi Kleen submitted code
to do that in Linux 2.5 in October 2002.  He claims the difference is
in the several per cent range.</P
