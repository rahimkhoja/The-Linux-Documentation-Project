is not as simple as it could be and depends on your having kernel

some macros in the source code, where the definitions belong.</P

conventional spot, <TT

enough to be using symbol versioning in your base kernel, then you
better have run 'make dep' on that kernel source too, because that's
what builds the .ver files that change the names of all your symbols.</P

a kernel that you loaded from a distribution CD, you often have to
separately load the headers for it.  To be safe, if you're playing
with compiling LKMs, you really should compile your own kernel, so you
know exactly what you're working with and can be absolutely sure
you're working with matching header files.</P

create something suitable for exec'ing in a user process.  As you will
not be exec'ing this module but rather adding it to the kernel, that
link phase would be entirely inappropriate.</P

>11.2. Using the Kernel Build System</H2
><P
>Lkmpg contains fine instructions for building (compiling) an LKM
(except that the __KERNEL__ macro and usually the MODULE macro should
be defined in the source code instead of with
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>-D</I
></TT
> compiler options as Lkmpg suggests).  But it
deserves mention that some Linux kernel programmers believe that the
only right way to build an LKM is to add it to a copy of the complete
Linux source tree and build it with the existing Linux make files
just like the LKMs that are part of Linux.</P
><P
>There are advantages to this.  The biggest one is that when Linux
programmers change the way LKMs interface with the rest of the kernel
in a way that affects how you build an LKM, you're covered.</P
><P
>On the other hand, you will probably find from a code management point
of view that you really have to keep your own code and Linux separate,
and from a coding point of view, you really need to understand all the
intricacies of how your code gets compiled, especially when it
changes.</P

<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Linux Device Drivers</I

Rubini, Jonathan Corbet, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.</P
><P
>Even if you're writing an LKM that isn't a device driver, you can learn
a lot from this book that will help you.</P
><P
>The first edition of this book covers Linux 2.0, with notes about
differences in 2.2.  The second edition (June 2001) covers Linux 2.4.
The third edition (April 2005) covers Linux 2.6.  Of course, if you know
anything about Linux, you know that a book like this doesn't perfectly
cover any release, because Linux changes frequently.  Linux 2.6 as was
current a month after the Third Edition was released had significant
differences from the Linux 2.6 about which the book was written.</P

>11.4. Module Use Counts</H2
><P
>It is essential that the kernel not try to reference the code of a
module after it has been unloaded; i.e. you must not unload a module
while it is in use.  An example of in use is a device driver for which
a device special file is open.  Because there is an open file
descriptor for it, a user might do a read of the device and to execute
that read, the kernel would want to call a function that is in the
device driver.  You can see that there would be a problem if you
unloaded that device driver module before the read -- the kernel would
reuse the memory that used to contain the read subroutine and there's
no telling what instructions the kernel would branch to when it thinks
it's calling the read subroutine.</P
><P
>In the original design, the LKM increments and decrements its use
count to tell the module manager whether it is OK to unload it.  For
example, if it's a filesystem driver, it would increment the use count
when someone mounts a filesystem of the type it drives, and decrement
it at unmount time.</P
><P
>Later a more flexible alternative was added.  Your LKM can register a
function that the module manager will call whenever it wants to know
if it is OK to unload the module.  If the function returns a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
> value, that means the LKM is busy and cannot
be unloaded.  If it returns a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT
> value, the LKM
is idle and can be unloaded.  The module manager holds the big kernel
lock from before calling the module-busy function until after its
cleanup subroutine returns or sleeps, and unless you've done something
odd, that should mean that your LKM cannot become busy between the
time that you report "not busy" and the time you clean up.</P
><P
>So how do you register the module-busy function?  By putting its
address in the unfortunately named <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
> field
in the module descriptor ("struct module").  The name is truly
unfortunate because the boolean value it returns is the exact opposite
of what "can unload" means: true if the module manager
<EM
>cannot</EM
> unload the LKM.</P
><P
>The module manager ensures that it does not attempt to unload the
module before its initialization subroutine has returned or sleeps, so
you are safe in setting the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
> field
anywhere in the initialization subroutine except after a sleep.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
> is little known and rarely used.  Starting
with Linux 2.6, it no longer exists.</P
><P
>Whether you use traditional use counts of
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>can_unload</TT
>, there are cases where you cannot be
sure that your module doesn't get unloaded while it is still in use.
If your LKM creates a kernel thread that executes LKM code, it is just
about impossible to be absolutely sure that thread is gone before the
LKM gets unloaded.  There are various other kernel services that you
can give addresses within your LKM that won't properly let you know
when they have forgotten them.</P
><P
>The problem used to be worse than it is now.  For example, it used to
be that if your LKM created a proc filesystem file, you couldn't stop
the LKM from getting unloaded while some process was executing your
read and write routines for the file.  This and other instances of the
problem have been fixed by having code <EM
>outside</EM
>
the LKM understand that the address it's using might be in an LKM, and
therefore increment and decrement the use count as necessary.  Where
this function is implemented, you often see a structure member named
"owner" which is a handle for the LKM (i.e. a struct module address).</P
><P
>These problems may be fixed in future version of Linux.  Until then,
you can just cross your fingers.  Some people believe these types of
problems are so hard to fix that the proper design for Linux is just
to make it impossible ever to unload an LKM.  Starting with Linux 2.6,
the CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD kernel build configuration option determines
whether module unloading is allowed or not.</P
