such a tool I suggest you try using it. If it works for you then you

have your dealer perform the installation.</P

for IRQ, DMA channel, etc; note down the values used. If you are
unsure, use the factory defaults. Try to avoid conflicts with other
devices (e.g. ethernet cards, SCSI host adaptors, serial and parallel
ports) if possible.</P
><P
>Usually you should use the same I/O port, IRQ, and DMA settings that
work under DOS. In some cases though (particularly with PnP cards) you
may need to use different settings to get things to work under Linux.
Some experimentation may be needed.</P

>4.2. Configuring ISA Plug and Play</A
></H2
><P
>Some sound cards use the ISA Plug and Play protocol to configure
settings for i/o addresses, interrupts, and DMA channels. If you have
a newer PCI-bus type of sound card, or one of the very old ISA sound
cards that uses fixed settings or jumpers, then you can skip this
section.</P
><P
>The preferred way to configure Plug and Play cards is to use the
isapnp tools which ship with most Linux distributions (or you can
download them from Red Hat's web site <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.redhat.com/</A
>).</P
><P
>First check the documentation for your Linux distribution. It may
already have Plug and Play support set up for you or it may work
slightly differently than described here. If you need to configure it
yourself,the details can be found in the man pages for the isapnp
tools. Briefly the process you would normally follow is:</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pnpdump</TT
> to capture the possible settings for all
your Plug and Play devices, saving the result to the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/isapnp.conf</TT
>.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Choose settings for the sound card that do not conflict with
any other devices in your system and uncomment the appropriate lines
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/isapnp.conf</TT
>. Don't forget to uncomment the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>(ACT Y)</TT
> command near the end.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make sure that <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>isapnp</TT
> is run when your system boots
up, normally done by one of the startup scripts. Reboot your system or
run <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>isapnp</TT
> manually.&#13;</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>If for some reason you cannot or do not wish to use the isapnp tools,
there are a couple of other options. If you use the card under
Microsoft Windows 95 or 98, you can use the device manager to set up
the card, then soft boot into Linux using the LOADLIN program. Make
sure Windows and Linux use the same card setup parameters.</P
><P
>If you use the card under DOS, you can use the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>icu</TT
> utility that comes with SoundBlaster16 PnP
cards to configure it under DOS, then soft boot into Linux using the
LOADLIN program. Again, make sure DOS and Linux use the same card
setup parameters.</P
><P
>True ISA PnP support is implemented in the 2.4 and later kernels.
Some of the sound card drivers now support automatically detecting and
configuring the cards without the isapnp tools. Check the
documentation for the card's driver for details.</P

>4.3. Configuring the Kernel</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;You need the appropriate device drivers for your sound card to be
present in the kernel. The kernel running on your system may already
include the drivers for your sound card. In most cases the drivers
would have been built as kernel loadable modules. You can check which
drivers are available as modules by looking in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules</TT
> directories. For the 2.4.4 kernel,
the sound drivers would normally appear in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/2.4.4/kernel/drivers/sound/</TT
>. If you
see the driver(s) for your sound card, you can try using the module
directory and skip recompiling the kernel.</P
><P
>If the sound drivers are not already built, you will need to configure
and build a new kernel. You can either build the sound drivers into
the kernel or build them as kernel loadable modules. In most cases
building as modules is preferred, as it allows you to easily
experiment with loading different drivers if unsure which one to use
and the drivers can be unloaded when not needed, freeing up memory.
Building the drivers into the kernel itself may be desirable if you
are unfamiliar with kernel modules and want a simpler solution.</P
><P
>The <A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Kernel HOWTO</A
>
should be consulted for the details of building a kernel. I will just
mention here some issues that are specific to sound cards.</P
><P
>If you have never configured the kernel for sound support before it is
a good idea to read the relevant documentation included with the
kernel sound drivers, particularly information specific to your card
type. The files can be found in the kernel documentation directory,
usually installed in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sound</TT
>.
If this directory is missing you likely either have a very old kernel
version or you have not installed the kernel source code.</P
><P
>Follow the usual procedure for building the kernel. There are
currently three interfaces to the configuration process. A graphical
user interface that runs under X11 can be invoked using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make
xconfig</TT
>. A menu-based system that only requires text displays is
available as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make menuconfig</TT
>. The original method, using
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make config</TT
>, offers a simple text-based interface.</P
><P
>When configuring the kernel there will be many choices for selecting
the type of sound card you have and the driver options to use.
The on-line help within the configuration tool should provide
an explanation of what each option is for. Select the appropriate
options to the best of your knowledge.</P
><P
>After configuring the options you should compile and install the new
kernel as per the Kernel HOWTO.</P

sound devices. These are normally created for you during installation
of your Linux system. A quick check can be made using the command
listed below. If the output is as shown (the date stamp will vary)
then the device files are almost certainly okay.

recreate them. Most Linux distributions have a <TT

there will be symbolic links to the older devices, such as /dev/dsp.</P

><P
>Note that, in general, using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cat</TT
> is not the proper way to
play audio files, it's just a quick check. You'll want to get a proper
sound player program (described later) that will do a better job.</P
><P
>If the above commands return "I/O error", you should look at the
end of the kernel messages listed using the "dmesg" command. It's
likely that an error message is printed there. Very often the message
is "Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?". The above
message means that the driver didn't get the expected interrupt from
the sound card. In most cases it means that the IRQ or the DMA channel
configured to the driver doesn't work. The best way to get it working
is to try with all possible DMAs and IRQs supported by the device.</P
><P
>Another possible reason is that the device is not compatible with the
device the driver is configured for. This is almost certainly the case
when a supposedly "SoundBlaster (Pro/16) compatible" sound card
doesn't work with the SoundBlaster driver. In this case you should try
to find out the device your sound card is compatible with (by posting
to the comp.os.linux.hardware newsgroup, for example).</P

>Now you can verify sound recording. If you have sound input
capability, you can do a quick test of this using commands such as the
following:

sound card and you should speak into it. You may also need to obtain a

recording gain level.</P
