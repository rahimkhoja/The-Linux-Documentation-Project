        the TCP port number it listens on for incoming H.323 requests, but
        since this attribute is never retrieved in search requests, it
        isn't as useful as it first appears.  In fact, NetMeeting always
        opens H.323 connections to the default port (1720), which raises
        the question of how to serve multiple aliases from a single IP
        address.

        machines.  Thus, calls to a unavailable user would be answered

>        As OpenH323's development continues, it's expected that
        these techniques will become more sophisticated, for example
        by ringing the user first and only forwarding to an answering
        machine if there's no answer after a given time.
	Such functionality would most likely be placed in a gatekeeper.
