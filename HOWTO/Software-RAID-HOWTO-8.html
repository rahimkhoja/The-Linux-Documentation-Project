<P><B>This HOWTO is deprecated; the Linux RAID HOWTO is maintained as a wiki by the
linux-raid community at 
<A HREF="http://raid.wiki.kernel.org/">http://raid.wiki.kernel.org/</A></B></P>
<P>If you have read the rest of this HOWTO, you should already have a pretty
good idea about what reconstruction of a degraded RAID involves. Let us
summarize: 
<UL>
<LI>Power down the system</LI>
<LI>Replace the failed disk</LI>
<LI>Power up the system once again.</LI>
<LI>Use <CODE>raidhotadd /dev/mdX /dev/sdX</CODE> to re-insert the disk
in the array</LI>
<LI>Have coffee while you watch the automatic reconstruction running</LI>
</UL>

And that's it.</P>
<P>Well, it usually is, unless you're unlucky and your RAID has been
rendered unusable because more disks than the ones redundant
failed. This can actually happen if a number of disks reside on the
same bus, and one disk takes the bus with it as it crashes. The other
disks, however fine, will be unreachable to the RAID layer, because
the bus is down, and they will be marked as faulty.  On a RAID-5 where
you can spare one disk only, loosing two or more disks can be fatal.</P>
<P>The following section is the explanation that Martin Bene gave to me,
and describes a possible recovery from the scary scenario outlined
above. It involves using the <CODE>failed-disk</CODE> directive in your
<CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE> (so for people running patched 2.2 kernels, this will only
work on kernels 2.2.10 and later).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Recovery from a multiple disk failure</A>
</H2>

<P>The scenario is:
<UL>
<LI>A controller dies and takes two disks offline at the same time,</LI>
<LI>All disks on one scsi bus can no longer be reached if a disk dies,</LI>
<LI>A cable comes loose...</LI>
</UL>

In short: quite often you get a <EM>temporary</EM> failure of several
disks at once; afterwards the RAID superblocks are out of sync and you
can no longer init your RAID array.</P>
<P>If using mdadm, you could first try to run:
<PRE>
  mdadm --assemble --force
</PRE>

If not, there's one thing left: rewrite the RAID superblocks by 
<CODE>mkraid --force</CODE></P>
<P>To get this to work, you'll need to have an up to date <CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE> - if
it doesn't <B>EXACTLY</B> match devices and ordering of the original
disks this will not work as expected, but <B>will most likely
completely obliterate whatever data you used to have on your
disks</B>.</P>
<P>Look at the sylog produced by trying to start the array, you'll see the
event count for each superblock; usually it's best to leave out the disk
with the lowest event count, i.e the oldest one.</P>
<P>If you <CODE>mkraid</CODE> without <CODE>failed-disk</CODE>, the recovery
thread will kick in immediately and start rebuilding the parity blocks
- not necessarily what you want at that moment.</P>
<P>With <CODE>failed-disk</CODE> you can specify exactly which disks you want
to be active and perhaps try different combinations for best
results. BTW, only mount the filesystem read-only while trying this
out... This has been successfully used by at least two guys I've been in
contact with.</P>
