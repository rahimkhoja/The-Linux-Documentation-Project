<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.1"><CODE>raid-level</CODE> and <CODE>raidtab</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Some GNU/Linux distributions, like RedHat 8.0 and possibly others,
have a bug in their init-scripts, so that they will fail to start up
RAID arrays on boot, if your <CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE> has spaces or tabs before the
<CODE>raid-level</CODE> keywords.</P>
<P>The simple workaround for this problem is to make sure that the
<CODE>raid-level</CODE> keyword appears in the very beginning of the
lines, without any leading spaces of any kind.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.2">Autodetection</A>
</H2>

<P>Autodetection allows the RAID devices to be automatically recognized
by the kernel at boot-time, right after the ordinary partition
detection is done. </P>
<P>This requires several things:
<OL>
<LI>You need autodetection support in the kernel. Check this</LI>
<LI>You must have created the RAID devices using persistent-superblock</LI>
<LI>The partition-types of the devices used in the RAID must be set to
<B>0xFD</B>  (use fdisk and set the type to "fd")</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>NOTE: Be sure that your RAID is NOT RUNNING before changing the
partition types.  Use <CODE>raidstop /dev/md0</CODE> to stop the device.</P>
<P>If you set up 1, 2 and 3 from above, autodetection should be set
up. Try rebooting.  When the system comes up, cat'ing <CODE>/proc/mdstat</CODE>
should tell you that your RAID is running.</P>
<P>During boot, you could see messages similar to these:

  starting background reconstruction 
</PRE>

This is output from the autodetection of a RAID-5 array that was not
cleanly shut down (eg. the machine crashed).  Reconstruction is
automatically initiated.  Mounting this device is perfectly safe,
since reconstruction is transparent and all data are consistent (it's
only the parity information that is inconsistent - but that isn't
needed until a device fails).</P>
<P>Autostarted devices are also automatically stopped at shutdown.  Don't
worry about init scripts.  Just use the /dev/md devices as any other
/dev/sd or /dev/hd devices.</P>
<P>Yes, it really is that easy.</P>
<P>You may want to look in your init-scripts for any raidstart/raidstop
commands. These are often found in the standard RedHat init
scripts. They are used for old-style RAID, and has no use in new-style
RAID with autodetection. Just remove the lines, and everything will be
just fine.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.3">Booting on RAID</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several ways to set up a system that mounts it's root
filesystem on a RAID device. Some distributions allow for RAID setup
in the installation process, and this is by far the easiest way to
get a nicely set up RAID system.</P>
<P>Newer LILO distributions can handle RAID-1 devices, and thus the
kernel can be loaded at boot-time from a RAID device. LILO will
correctly write boot-records on all disks in the array, to allow
booting even if the primary disk fails.</P>
<P>If you are using grub instead of LILO, then just start grub and configure 
it to use the second (or third, or fourth...) disk in the RAID-1 array you 
want to boot off as its root device and run setup. And that's all.</P>
<P>For example, on an array consisting of /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdc1 where
both partitions should be bootable you should just do this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
grub
grub>device (hd0) /dev/hdc
grub>root (hd0,0)       
grub>setup (hd0)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Some users have experienced problems with this, reporting that although
booting with one drive connected worked, booting with <EM>both</EM> 
two drives failed.
Nevertheless, running the described procedure with both disks fixed
the problem, allowing the system to boot from either single drive or 
from the RAID-1</P>
<P>Another way of ensuring that your system can always boot is, to create
a boot floppy when all the setup is done. If the disk on which the
<CODE>/boot</CODE> filesystem resides dies, you can always boot from the
floppy. On RedHat and RedHat derived systems, this can be accomplished
with the <CODE>mkbootdisk</CODE> command.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.4">Root filesystem on RAID</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to have a system booting on RAID, the root filesystem (/)
must be mounted on a RAID device. Two methods for achieving this is
supplied bellow. The methods below assume that you install on a normal
partition, and then - when the installation is complete - move the
contents of your non-RAID root filesystem onto a new RAID
device. Please not that this is no longer needed in general, as most
newer GNU/Linux distributions support installation on RAID devices
(and creation of the RAID devices during the installation process).
However, you may still want to use the methods below, if you are
migrating an existing system to RAID.</P>

<H3>Method 1</H3>

<P>This method assumes you have a spare disk you can install the system
on, which is not part of the RAID you will be configuring.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First, install a normal system on your extra disk.</LI>
<LI>Get the kernel you plan on running, get the raid-patches and the
tools, and make your system boot with this new RAID-aware
kernel. Make sure that RAID-support is <B>in</B> the kernel, and is
not loaded as modules.</LI>
<LI>Ok, now you should configure and create the RAID you plan to use
for the root filesystem. This is standard procedure, as described
elsewhere in this document.</LI>
<LI>Just to make sure everything's fine, try rebooting the system to
see if the new RAID comes up on boot. It should.</LI>
<LI>Put a filesystem on the new array (using
<CODE>mke2fs</CODE>), and mount it under /mnt/newroot</LI>
<LI>Now, copy the contents of your current root-filesystem (the
spare disk) to the new root-filesystem (the array). There are lots of
ways to do this, one of them is
<PRE>
 cd /
 find . -xdev | cpio -pm /mnt/newroot
</PRE>

another way to copy everything from / to /mnt/newroot could be
<PRE>
  cp -ax / /mnt/newroot
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>You should modify the <CODE>/mnt/newroot/etc/fstab</CODE> file to
use the correct device (the <CODE>/dev/md?</CODE> root device) for the
root filesystem.</LI>
<LI>Now, unmount the current <CODE>/boot</CODE> filesystem, and mount
the boot device on <CODE>/mnt/newroot/boot</CODE> instead. This is
required for LILO to run successfully in the next step.</LI>
<LI>Update <CODE>/mnt/newroot/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> to point to the right
devices. The boot device must still be a regular disk (non-RAID
device), but the root device should point to your new RAID. When
done, run 
<PRE>
 lilo -r /mnt/newroot
</PRE>
This LILO run should
complete 
with no errors.</LI>
<LI>Reboot the system, and watch everything come up as expected  :)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If you're doing this with IDE disks, be sure to tell your BIOS that
all disks are "auto-detect" types, so that the BIOS will allow your
machine to boot even when a disk is missing.</P>

<H3>Method 2</H3>

<P>This method requires that your kernel and raidtools understand the
<CODE>failed-disk</CODE> directive in the <CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE> file - if you are
working on a really old system this may not be the case, and you will
need to upgrade your tools and/or kernel first.</P>
<P>You can <B>only</B> use this method on RAID levels 1 and above, as
the method uses an array in "degraded mode" which in turn is only
possible if the RAID level has redundancy. The idea is to install a
system on a disk which is purposely marked as failed in the RAID, then
copy the system to the RAID which will be running in degraded mode,
and finally making the RAID use the no-longer needed "install-disk",
zapping the old installation but making the RAID run in non-degraded
mode.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First, install a normal system on one disk (that will later
become part of your RAID). It is important that this disk (or
partition) is not the smallest one. If it is, it will not be possible
to add it to the RAID later on!</LI>
<LI>Then, get the kernel, the patches, the tools etc. etc. You know
the drill. Make your system boot with a new kernel that has the RAID
support you need, compiled into the kernel.</LI>
<LI>Now, set up the RAID with your current root-device as the
<CODE>failed-disk</CODE> in the <CODE><CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE></CODE> file. Don't put the
<CODE>failed-disk</CODE> as the first disk in the <CODE>raidtab</CODE>, that will give
you problems with starting the RAID. Create the RAID, and put a
filesystem on it.
If using mdadm, you can create a degraded array just by running
something like <CODE>mdadm -C /dev/md0 --level raid1 --raid-disks 2 missing /dev/hdc1</CODE>, note the <CODE>missing</CODE> parameter.</LI>
<LI>Try rebooting and see if the RAID comes up as it should</LI>
<LI>Copy the system files, and reconfigure the system to use the
RAID as root-device, as described in the previous section.</LI>
<LI>When your system successfully boots from the RAID, you can
modify the <CODE><CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE></CODE> file to include the previously
<CODE>failed-disk</CODE> as a normal <CODE>raid-disk</CODE>. Now,
<CODE>raidhotadd</CODE> the disk to your RAID.</LI>
<LI>You should now have a system that can boot from a non-degraded
RAID.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.5">Making the system boot on RAID</A>
</H2>

<P>For the kernel to be able to mount the root filesystem, all support
for the device on which the root filesystem resides, must be present
in the kernel. Therefore, in order to mount the root filesystem on a
RAID device, the kernel <EM>must</EM> have RAID support.</P>
<P>The normal way of ensuring that the kernel can see the RAID device is
to simply compile a kernel with all necessary RAID support compiled
in. Make sure that you compile the RAID support <EM>into</EM> the
kernel, and <EM>not</EM> as loadable modules. The kernel cannot load a 
module (from the root filesystem) before the root filesystem is
mounted.</P>
<P>However, since RedHat-6.0 ships with a kernel that has new-style RAID
support as modules, I here describe how one can use the standard
RedHat-6.0 kernel and still have the system boot on RAID.</P>

<H3>Booting with RAID as module</H3>

<P>You will have to instruct LILO to use a RAM-disk in order to achieve
this. Use the <CODE>mkinitrd</CODE> command to create a ramdisk containing 
all kernel modules needed to mount the root partition. This can be
done as:
<PRE>
 mkinitrd --with=&lt;module&gt; &lt;ramdisk name&gt; &lt;kernel&gt;
</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>
 mkinitrd --preload raid5 --with=raid5 raid-ramdisk 2.2.5-22
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This will ensure that the specified RAID module is present at
boot-time, for the kernel to use when mounting the root device.</P>

<H3>Modular RAID on Debian GNU/Linux after move to RAID</H3>

<P>Debian users may encounter problems using an initrd to mount their
root filesystem from RAID, if they have migrated a standard non-RAID
Debian install to root on RAID.</P>
<P>If your system fails to mount the root filesystem on boot (you will
see this in a "kernel panic" message), then the problem may be that
the initrd filesystem does not have the necessary support to mount the
root filesystem from RAID.</P>
<P>Debian seems to produce its <CODE>initrd.img</CODE> files on the
assumption that the root filesystem to be mounted is the current one.
This will usually result in a kernel panic if the root filesystem is
moved to the raid device and you attempt to boot from that device
using the same initrd image.  The solution is to use the
<CODE>mkinitrd</CODE> command but specifying the proposed new root
filesystem.  For example, the following commands should create and set
up the new initrd on a Debian system:
<PRE>
% mkinitrd -r /dev/md0 -o /boot/initrd.img-2.4.22raid
% mv /initrd.img /initrd.img-nonraid
% ln -s /boot/initrd.img-raid /initrd.img"
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.6">Converting a non-RAID RedHat System to run on Software RAID</A>
</H2>

<P>This section was written and contributed by Mark Price, IBM. The text
has undergone minor changes since his original work.</P>
<P><B>Notice:</B> the following information is provided "AS IS" with no
representation or warranty of any kind either express or implied. You
may use it freely at your own risk, and no one else will be liable for
any damages arising out of such usage.</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The technote details how to convert a linux system with non RAID devices to
run with a Software RAID configuration.</P>

<H3>Scope</H3>

<P>This scenario was tested with Redhat 7.1, but should be applicable to any
release which supports Software RAID (md) devices.</P>

<H3>Pre-conversion example system</H3>

<P>The test system contains two SCSI disks, sda and sdb both of of which are the
same physical size. As part of the test setup, I configured both disks to have
the same partition layout, using fdisk to ensure the number of blocks for each
partition was identical.
<PRE>
DEVICE      MOUNTPOINT  SIZE        DEVICE      MOUNTPOINT  SIZE
/dev/sda1   /           2048MB      /dev/sdb1               2048MB
/dev/sda2   /boot       80MB        /dev/sdb2               80MB
/dev/sda3   /var/       100MB       /dev/sdb3               100MB
/dev/sda4   SWAP        1024MB      /dev/sdb4   SWAP        1024MB
</PRE>

In our basic example, we are going to set up a simple RAID-1 Mirror, which
requires only two physical disks.</P>

<H3>Step-1 - boot rescue cd/floppy</H3>

<P>The redhat installation CD provides a rescue mode which boots into linux from
the CD and mounts any filesystems it can find on your disks.</P>
<P>At the lilo prompt type
<PRE>
    lilo: linux rescue
</PRE>
</P>
<P>With the setup described above, the installer may ask you which disk your root
filesystem in on, either sda or sdb. Select sda.</P>
<P>The installer will mount your filesytems in the following way.
<PRE>
DEVICE      MOUNTPOINT  TEMPORARY MOUNT POINT
/dev/sda1   /           /mnt/sysimage
/dev/sda2   /boot       /mnt/sysimage/boot
/dev/sda3   /var        /mnt/sysimage/var
/dev/sda6   /home       /mnt/sysimage/home
</PRE>
</P>
<P><B>Note</B>: - Please bear in mind other distributions may mount
your filesystems on different mount points, or may require you
to mount them by hand.</P>

<H3>Step-2 - create a <CODE>/etc/raidtab</CODE> file</H3>

<P>Create the file /mnt/sysimage/etc/raidtab (or wherever your real /etc file
system has been mounted.</P>
<P>For our test system, the raidtab file would like like this.
<PRE>
raiddev /dev/md0
    raid-level              1
    nr-raid-disks           2
    nr-spare-disks          0

    persistent-superblock   1
    device                  /dev/sda3
    raid-disk               0
    device                  /dev/sdb3
    raid-disk               1
</PRE>
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> - It is important that the devices are in the correct
order. ie. that <CODE>/dev/sda1</CODE> is <CODE>raid-disk 0</CODE> and
not <CODE>raid-disk 1</CODE>. This instructs the md driver to sync
from <CODE>/dev/sda1</CODE>, if it were the other way around it
would sync from <CODE>/dev/sdb1</CODE> which would destroy your
filesystem.</P>
<P>Now copy the raidtab file from your real root filesystem to the current root
filesystem.
<PRE>
(rescue)# cp /mnt/sysimage/etc/raidtab /etc/raidtab
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Step-3 - create the md devices</H3>

<P>There are two ways to do this, copy the device files from /mnt/sysimage/dev
or use mknod to create them. The md device, is a (b)lock device with major
number 9.
<PRE>
(rescue)# mknod /dev/md0 b 9 0
(rescue)# mknod /dev/md1 b 9 1
(rescue)# mknod /dev/md2 b 9 2
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Step-4 - unmount filesystems</H3>

<P>In order to start the raid devices, and sync the drives, it is necessary to
unmount all the temporary filesystems.
<PRE>
(rescue)# umount /mnt/sysimage/var
(rescue)# umount /mnt/sysimage/boot
(rescue)# umount /mnt/sysimage/proc
(rescue)# umount /mnt/sysimage
</PRE>

Please note, you may not be able to umount
<CODE>/mnt/sysimage</CODE>. This problem can be caused by the rescue
system - if you choose to manually mount your filesystems instead of
letting the rescue system do this automatically, this problem should
go away.</P>

<H3>Step-5 - start raid devices</H3>

<P>Because there are filesystems on /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 it is
necessary to force the start of the raid device.
<PRE>
(rescue)# mkraid --really-force /dev/md2
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You can check the completion progress by cat'ing the <CODE>/proc/mdstat</CODE> file. It
shows you status of the raid device and percentage left to sync.</P>
<P>Continue with /boot and /
<PRE>
(rescue)# mkraid --really-force /dev/md1
(rescue)# mkraid --really-force /dev/md0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The md driver syncs one device at a time.</P>

<H3>Step-6 - remount filesystems</H3>

<P>Mount the newly synced filesystems back into the /mnt/sysimage mount points.
<PRE>
(rescue)# mount /dev/md0 /mnt/sysimage
(rescue)# mount /dev/md1 /mnt/sysimage/boot
(rescue)# mount /dev/md2 /mnt/sysimage/var
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Step-7 - change root</H3>

<P>You now need to change your current root directory to your real root file
system.
<PRE>
(rescue)# chroot /mnt/sysimage
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Step-8 - edit config files</H3>

<P>You need to configure lilo and <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> appropriately to boot from and mount
the md devices.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> - The boot device MUST be a non-raided device. The root
device is your new md0 device.  eg.
<PRE>
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
message=/boot/message
linear
default=linux

image=/boot/vmlinuz
    label=linux
    read-only
    root=/dev/md0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Alter <CODE><CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE></CODE>
<PRE>
/dev/md0               /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
/dev/md1               /boot                   ext3    defaults        1 2
/dev/md2               /var                    ext3    defaults        1 2
/dev/sda4              swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Step-9 - run LILO</H3>

<P>With the <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> edited to reflect the new
<CODE>root=/dev/md0</CODE> and with <CODE>/dev/md1</CODE> mounted as
<CODE>/boot</CODE>, we can now run <CODE>/sbin/lilo -v</CODE> on the chrooted
filesystem.</P>

<H3>Step-10 - change partition types</H3>

<P>The partition types of the all the partitions on ALL Drives which are used by
the md driver must be changed to type 0xFD.</P>
<P>Use fdisk to change the partition type, using option 't'.
<PRE>
(rescue)# fdisk /dev/sda
(rescue)# fdisk /dev/sdb
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Use the 'w' option after changing all the required partitions to save the
partion table to disk.</P>

<H3>Step-11 - resize filesystem</H3>

<P>When we created the raid device, the physical partion became slightly smaller
because a second superblock is stored at the end of the partition. If you
reboot the system now, the reboot will fail with an error indicating the
superblock is corrupt.</P>
<P>Resize them prior to the reboot, ensure that the all md based filesystems
are unmounted except root, and remount root read-only.
<PRE>
(rescue)# mount / -o remount,ro
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You will be required to fsck each of the md devices. This is the reason for
remounting root read-only. The -f flag is required to force fsck to check a
clean filesystem.
<PRE>
(rescue)# e2fsck -f /dev/md0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This will generate the same error about inconsistent sizes and possibly
corrupted superblock.Say N to 'Abort?'.
<PRE>
(rescue)# resize2fs /dev/md0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Repeat for all <CODE>/dev/md</CODE> devices.</P>

<H3>Step-12 - checklist</H3>

<P>The next step is to reboot the system, prior to doing this run through the
checklist below and ensure all tasks have been completed.
<UL>
<LI>All devices have finished syncing. Check <CODE>/proc/mdstat</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE><CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE></CODE> has been edited to reflect the changes to the device names.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> has beeb edited to reflect root device change.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/sbin/lilo</CODE> has been run to update the boot loader.</LI>
<LI>The kernel has both SCSI and RAID(MD) drivers built into the kernel.</LI>
<LI>The partition types of all partitions on disks that are part of an md device
have been changed to 0xfd.</LI>
<LI>The filesystems have been fsck'd and resize2fs'd.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Step-13 - reboot</H3>

<P>You can now safely reboot the system, when the system comes up it will
auto discover the md devices (based on the partition types).</P>
<P>Your root filesystem will now be mirrored.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.7">Sharing spare disks between different arrays</A>
</H2>

<P>When running mdadm in the follow/monitor mode you can make different
arrays share spare disks. That will surely make you save storage space without
losing the comfort of fallback disks.</P>
<P>In the world of software RAID, this is a brand new never-seen-before feature:
for securing things to the point of spare disk areas, you just have to provide
one single idle disk for a bunch of arrays.</P>
<P>With mdadm is running as a daemon, you have an agent polling arrays at regular
intervals. Then, as a disk fails on an array without a spare disk, mdadm removes
an available spare disk from another array and inserts it into the array with the
failed disk. The reconstruction process begins now in the degraded array as usual.</P>
<P>To declare shared spare disks, just use the <CODE>spare-group</CODE> parameter
when invoking mdadm as a daemon.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc7.8">Pitfalls</A>
</H2>

<P>Never NEVER <B>never</B> re-partition disks that are part of a running
RAID. If you must alter the partition table on a disk which is a part
of a RAID, stop the array first, then repartition.</P>
<P>It is easy to put too many disks on a bus. A normal Fast-Wide SCSI bus
can sustain 10 MB/s which is less than many disks can do alone
today. Putting six such disks on the bus will of course not give you
the expected performance boost. It is becoming equally easy to
saturate the PCI bus - remember, a normal 32-bit 33 MHz PCI bus has a
theoretical maximum bandwidth of around 133 MB/sec, considering
command overhead etc. you will see a somewhat lower real-world
transfer rate. Some disks today has a throughput in excess of 30
MB/sec, so just four of those disks will actually max out your PCI
bus! When designing high-performance RAID systems, be sure to take the
whole I/O path into consideration - there are boards with more PCI
busses, with 64-bit and 66 MHz busses, and with PCI-X.</P>
<P>More SCSI controllers will only give you extra performance, if the
SCSI busses are nearly maxed out by the disks on them.  You will not
see a performance improvement from using two 2940s with two old SCSI
disks, instead of just running the two disks on one controller.</P>
<P>If you forget the persistent-superblock option, your array may not
start up willingly after it has been stopped.  Just re-create the
array with the option set correctly in the raidtab. Please note that
this will destroy the information on the array!</P>
<P>If a RAID-5 fails to reconstruct after a disk was removed and
re-inserted, this may be because of the ordering of the devices in the
raidtab. Try moving the first "device ..." and "raid-disk ..."
pair to the bottom of the array description in the raidtab file.</P>
