>This mini-HOWTO was created because of my experience with burning music CDs
and lack of some specific information about sound normalization on the
Internet. I usually burn music CDs as a mix - different songs from different
sources.Very often volume level between songs varies greatly. This is the
first obstacle. Second, many of the files on the Internet are not
CD-compatible (16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz) and have to be converted. There are
many programs to burn music CDs from MP3 files, and many of them do the
conversion transparently. But I haven't seen a single tool that also
normalizes the volume, so that's why I worked out my own CD-burning recipe.</P

>This HOWTO is just about one thing - putting MP3 music on a CD, so that you can
listen to it. For in-depth information about MP3 files, please look at <EM

HOWTO</EM

>I'm assuming you wish to burn a CD with the collection of songs you obtained
from different sources, all varying quality, but you want to get the
best-sounding CD possible. This mini-HOWTO outlines the steps that may
help you.</P
