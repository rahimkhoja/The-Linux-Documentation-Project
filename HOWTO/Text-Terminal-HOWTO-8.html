<P> If you know almost nothing about terminals, it's suggested that
you first read 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-1.html#intro">Introduction</A> and also read 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-6.html#overview">Overview of How Terminals Work</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="term_mem_detail"></A> <A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Terminal Memory Details </A>
 </H2>

<P> The
terminal screen refreshes itself at perhaps 60 times per second from
an image stored in the memory of the terminal.  For a PC the monitor's
image is stored on the video card inside the computer but for a
terminal, the equivalent of the video card is inside the terminal.
For a text terminal the storage of the image uses little memory.
Instead of putting every dot (pixel) on the screen into memory and
requiring the storage of about a quarter-million dots, a much more
efficient method of storage is used.</P>
<P>A screen-full of text may be represented inside the terminal memory by
ASCII bytes, one for each character on the screen.   An entire screen
only takes about 2K ASCII bytes.  To display these characters, the
terminal must also know the bit-map (the shape) of each of the almost
100 printable ASCII characters.  With a bit-map of a character using
say 15 bytes, only about 1.5K of memory is needed for the bit-maps of
all the ASCII characters (the font).  This ASCII text and font memory
is scanned so that the resulting image is put on the screen about 60
times each second.  This is a form of shared memory where a single
bit-map of a letter such as the letter e, is shared by all of the many
letter e's which appear on a screen-full of text.  Low memory
requirements meant low costs to produce monitors in the early 1980's
when the cost of memory was several thousand times higher than it is
today (costing then several dollars per kilobyte).</P>

<H2><A NAME="early_terms"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">Early Terminals  </A>
 </H2>

<P> The first terminals were something like remotely controlled
typewriters which could only "display" (print on paper) the character
stream sent to them from the computer.  The earliest models were
called 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-24.html#teletype">Teletypes</A>.  The name "tty" is just
an abbreviation for "Teletype".   Early terminals could do a line feed
and a carriage return just like a typewriter and ring a bell when a
bell character was received.  Due to the lack of significant
capabilities this was the first type of terminal to be labeled "dumb".
This type of terminal interface (using a terminal type called "dumb")
is sometimes used today when the computer can't figure out what kind
of a terminal it is communicating with.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc8.3">Escape Sequences and Control Codes (intro) </A>
</H2>

<P> Terminals have
many capabilities some of which are always present and some of which
require commands from the computer to change or activate.  To exercise
all these capabilities under the control of the computer requires that
special codes be established so that the computer can tell the
terminal what to do.  There are two major type of such codes: escape
sequences and control codes (control characters).  There are many
times more escape sequences than control codes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="control_codes"></A> Control codes   </H3>

<P> The control
codes (or control characters) consist of the first 32 bytes of the
ASCII alphabet.  They include the following: carriage-return (cursor
to far left), line-feed (cursor down one line), backspace,
escape-character, tab, and bell.  They do not normally show on the
screen.  There is usually a command which you may give to your
terminal which will result in them being displayed when they are
received by the terminal.  It's called something like "Display
Controls" or "Monitor".  If you do this then the display may look a
mess since escape sequences, which all start with the ESC (escape)
control character, are no longer executed.  Words which should appear
at the top or bottom of the screen will show up in other locations.
The escape sequences to reposition the cursor display on the screen
but the cursor doesn't move to where the escape sequence says.</P>

<H3><A NAME="esc_seq"></A> Escape sequences  </H3>

<P> Since there are not
nearly enough control codes to do everything (and for some reason, not
all of them are utilized) many escape sequences are used.  They
consist of the "escape" (ESC) control character followed by a sequence
of ordinary characters.  Upon receiving an escape character, the
terminal examines the characters following it so that it may interpret
the sequence and carry out the intended command from the computer.
Once it recognizes the end of a valid sequence, further characters
received just display on the screen (unless they are control codes or
more escape sequences).  Some escape sequences may take parameters (or
arguments) such as the coordinates on the screen to move the cursor
to.  The parameters become a part of the escape sequence.  An 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-22.html#esc_seq_lists">Esc Sequence List</A> is on the web for some
terminals, but it's terse.</P>
<P>A list of the escape sequences for your terminal should be in the
"programmers manual" for the terminal.  Except for very old terminals,
there may be two or three hundred such sequences.  If you don't have a
such manual it's not easy to find them.  Some of the sequences are
available on the Internet.  One link is 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-22.html#esc_seq_lists">Esc Sequence List</A>.  By searching the Internet for one sequence
(such as ESC[5m) you may come across a long list of them.</P>
<P>Another way to determine some of them is to find the terminfo entry
(termcap) for the terminal and mentally decode it.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-16.html#termcap2">Terminfo and Termcap (detailed)</A> in this document
and/or the 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-16.html#termcap_docs">Termcap Manual</A> on the
Internet.  Unfortunately, the terminfo (termcap) for a terminal often
does not list all of the escape sequences which the terminal has
available for use, but fortunately, the most important ones are
usually there.</P>

<H2><A NAME="display_attributes"></A> <A NAME="ss8.4">8.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc8.4">Display Attributes &amp; Magic Cookies </A>
 </H2>

<P> Terminals have various methods of
generating character attributes such as bold, reverse-video,
underlining, etc.  There should be no need for the user to worry about
how this is done, except that it creates problems for some old
terminals and there is sometimes an option for this in the set-up menu
of newer terminals.</P>
<P>The magic cookie method is obsolete.  It's the simplest (and worst)
method of defining attributes: Use a certain byte for the start of an
attribute and another to end that attribute.  For example, a "start
underlining" magic cookie byte is placed just before the first word to
be underlined.  These extra bytes are put into the memory of the
screen page, just like character bytes that display as characters.
But this might foul up the count of the number of characters per line
since non-printable magic cookie characters are intermingled with
other printable characters.  This sometimes causes problems.</P>
<P>A better method which uses more memory is to assign an attribute byte
(or half=byte, etc.) to each displayed character.  This method is used
by PC video cards (for text) for the common PC monitor.</P>
