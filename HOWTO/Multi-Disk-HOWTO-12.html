Having done the layout you should now have a detailed description on
what goes where. Most likely this will be on paper but hopefully
someone will make a more automated system that can deal with
everything from the design, through partitioning to formatting and
installation. This is the route one will have to take to realise the
design.
<P>Modern distributions come with installation tools that will guide you
through partitioning and formatting and also set up <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE>
for you automatically. For later modifications, however, you will need
to understand the underlying mechanisms.

When you start DOS or the like you will find all partitions labeled
<CODE>C:</CODE> and onwards, with no differentiation on IDE, SCSI, network or
whatever type of media you have. In the world of Linux this is rather
different. During booting you will see partitions described like this:

Dec  6 23:45:18 demos kernel: Partition check:
Dec  6 23:45:18 demos kernel:  sda: sda1
Dec  6 23:45:18 demos kernel:  hda: hda1 hda2
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>SCSI drives are labelled <CODE>sda</CODE>, <CODE>sdb</CODE>, <CODE>sdc</CODE> etc, and
(E)IDE drives are labelled <CODE>hda</CODE>, <CODE>hdb</CODE>, <CODE>hdc</CODE> etc. 
There are also standard names for all devices, full information can be
found in 
<CODE>/dev/MAKEDEV</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt</CODE>.
<P>Partitions are labelled numerically for each drive <CODE>hda1</CODE>, <CODE>hda2</CODE>
and so on.  On SCSI drives there can be 15 partitions per
drive, on EIDE drives there can be 63 partitions per drive. Both
limits exceed what is currently useful for most disks.
<P>These are then mounted according to the file <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> before
they appear as a part of the file system.

of
<A HREF="http://www.userfriendly.org/">User Friendly</A>
in the song "Refund this")
<P>First you have to partition each drive into a number of separate partitions.
Under Linux there are two main methods, <CODE>fdisk</CODE> and the more screen
oriented <CODE>cfdisk</CODE>. These are complex programs, read the manual <EM>very</EM>
carefully. For the experts there is now also <CODE>sfdisk</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Partitions come in 3 flavours, <CODE>primary</CODE>, <CODE>extended</CODE> and <CODE>logical</CODE>.
You have to use <CODE>primary</CODE> partitions for booting, but there is a maximum
of 4 primary partitions. If you want more you have to define an <CODE>extended</CODE>
partition within which you define your <CODE>logical</CODE> partitions.
<P>Each partition has an identifier number which tells the operating system
what it is, for Linux the types <CODE>swap(82)</CODE> and <CODE>ext2fs(83)</CODE> are
the ones you
will need to know.
If you want to use RAID with autostart you have to check the documentation
for the appropriate type number for the RAID partition.
<P>There is a readme file that comes with <CODE>fdisk</CODE> that gives more in-depth
information on partitioning.
<P>Someone has just made a <EM>Partitioning HOWTO</EM> which contains excellent,
in depth information on the nitty-gritty of partitioning. Rather than
repeating it here and bloating this document further, I will instead refer
you to it instead.
<P>Redhat has written a screen oriented utility called <EM>Disk Druid</EM> which
is supposed to be a user friendly alternative
to <CODE>fdisk</CODE> and <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> and also
automates a few other things. Unfortunately this product is not quite
mature so if you use it and cannot get it to work you are well advised
to try <CODE>fdisk</CODE> or <CODE>cfdisk</CODE>.
<P>Not to be outdone, Mandrakesoft has made an even more graphic alternative
called
<A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/diskdrake/">Diskdrake</A>
that also offers numerous features.
<P>Also the GNU project offers a partitioning tool called
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/">GNU Parted</A><P>
<P>The 
<A HREF="http://www.users.intercom.com/~ranish/part/">Ranish Partition Manager</A>
is another free alternative,
while
<A HREF="http://www.powerquest.com">Partition Magic</A>
is a popular commercial alternative which also offers some
support for resizing <CODE>ext2fs</CODE> partitions.
<P>Note that Windows will complain if it finds
more than one primary partition on a drive.
Also it appears to assign drive letters
to primary partitions as it finds disks
before starting over from the first disk to
assign subsequent drive names to logical partitions.
<P>If you want DOS/Windows on your system you should make that partition
first, a primary one to boot to, made with the DOS <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program.
Then if you want NT you put that one in.
Finally, for Linux, you create those partitions with the Linux <CODE>fdisk</CODE>
program or equivalents. Linux is flexible enough to boot from both
primary as well as logical partitions.
<P>In depth information on DOS <CODE>fdisk</CODE> can be found at

Sometimes it is necessary to change the sizes of existing partitions
while keeping the contents intact. One way is of course to back up
everything, recreate new partitions and then restore the old contents,
and while this gives your back up system a good test it is also
rather time consuming.
<P>Partition resizing is a simpler alternative where a file system is
first shrunk to desired volume and then the partition table is
updated to reflect the new end of partition position. This process
is therefore very file system sensitive.
<P>Repartitioning requires there to be free space at the end of
the file space so to ensure you are able to shrink the size
you should first defragment your drive and empty any wastebaskets.
<P>Using 
<A HREF="http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/">fips</A>
you can resize a <CODE>fat</CODE> partition,
and the latest version 1.6 of <CODE>fips</CODE> or <CODE>fips 2.0</CODE>
are also able to resize <CODE>fat32</CODE> partition.
Note that these programs actually run under DOS.
<P>Resizing other file systems are much more complicated but one
popular commercial system
<A HREF="http://www.powerquest.com">Partition Magic</A>
is able to resize more file system types, including <CODE>ext2fs</CODE>
using the <CODE>resize2fs</CODE> program. Make sure you get the latest
updates to this program as recent versions had problems with
large disks.
<P>
<P>In order to get the most out of <CODE>fips</CODE> you should
first delete unnecessary files, empty wastebaskets etc.
before defragmenting your drive.
This way you can allocate more space to other partitions.
If the program complains there are still files at the end
of your drive it is probably hidden files generated by
Microsoft Mirror or Norton Image.
These are probably called <CODE>image.idx</CODE> and <CODE>image.dat</CODE> and
contain backups of some system files.
<P>There are reports that in some Windows defragmentation programs
you should make sure the box "allow Windows to move files around"
is <EM>not</EM> checked, otherwise you will end up with some files
in the last cylinder of the partition which will prevent FIPS
from reclaiming space.
<P>If you still have unmovable files at the end of your DOS partition
you should get the DOS program
<A HREF="http://www8.pair.com/dmurdoch/programs/showfat.htm">showfat</A>
version 3.0 or higher.
This shows you what files are where so you can deal with them
directly.
<P>A freeware alternative is
<A HREF="http://members.nbci.com/Zeleps/">Partition Resizer</A>
which can shrink, grow and move partitions.
<P>Some versions of DOS / Windows have a hidden flag for <CODE>defrag</CODE>, "<CODE>/P</CODE> that
causes <CODE>defrag</CODE> to move even hidden files. Use at own risk.
<P>
<P>Repartitioning is as dangerous process as any other partitioning
so you are advised to have a fresh backup handy.

<!--
disk!Microsoft!nasty bug

In Microsoft products all the way up to Win 98 there is a tricky bug
that can cause you a bit of trouble:
if you have several primary <CODE>fat</CODE> partitions
and the last extended partition is not a <CODE>fat</CODE> partition
the Microsoft system will try to mount the last partition as if
it were a FAT partition in place of the last primary FAT partition.
<P>There is more
<A HREF="http://www.v-com.com/">information</A>
available on the net on this.
<P>To avoid this you can place a small logical <CODE>fat</CODE> partition
at the very end of your disk.
<P>More information on multi OS installations are available at
<A HREF="http://www.v-com.com/">V Communications</A> but they keep rearranging the
links continuously so no direct links can be offered here.
<P>
<P>Since some hardware comes with setup software that is available
under DOS only this could come in handy anyway. Notable examples
are RAID controllers from DPT and a number of networking cards.

Being in a state of flux you should make sure to read the latest
documentation on this kernel feature. It is not yet stable, beware.
<P>Briefly explained it works by adding partitions together into new
devices <CODE>md0</CODE>, <CODE>md1</CODE> etc. using <CODE>mdadd</CODE> before you activate
them using <CODE>mdrun</CODE>. This process can be automated using the file
<CODE>/etc/mdtab</CODE>.
<P>The latest <CODE>md</CODE> system uses a  
<A HREF="file:///etc/raidtab">/etc/raidtab</A>
and
a different syntax. Make sure your RAID-tools package matches
the <CODE>md</CODE> version as the internal protocol has changed.
<P>Then you then treat these like any other partition on a drive. Proceed
with formatting etc. as described below using these new devices.
<P>There is now also a HOWTO in development for RAID using <CODE>md</CODE> you
should read.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.7">12.7 Formatting</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!implementation!formatting
-->

Next comes partition formatting, putting down the data structures that will
describe the files and where they are located. If this is the first time it
is recommended you use formatting with verify. Strictly speaking it should
not be necessary but this exercises the I/O hard enough that it can uncover
potential problems, such as incorrect termination, before you store your
precious data. Look up the command <CODE>mkfs</CODE> for more details.
<P>Linux can support a great number of file systems, rather than repeating
the details you can read the man page for <CODE>fs</CODE> which describes them in
some details. Note that your kernel has to have the drivers compiled in
or made as modules in order to be able to use these features. When the time
comes for kernel compiling you should read carefully through the file system
feature list. If you use <CODE>make menuconfig</CODE> you can get online help for
each file system type.
<P>Note that some rescue disk systems require <CODE>minix</CODE>, <CODE>msdos</CODE> and <CODE>ext2fs</CODE>
to be compiled into the kernel.
<P>Also swap partitions have to be prepared, and for this you use <CODE>mkswap</CODE>.
<P>Some important notes on formatting with DOS and Windows can be found in
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/axcel216/secrets.htm">MS-DOS 5.00 - 7.10 Undocumented, Secret + Hidden Features</A>.
<P>Note that this formatting is high level formatting, that writes the file
system to the disk, as opposed to low level formatting that lays down
tracks and sectors. The latter is hardly ever needed these days.

<H2><A NAME="ss12.8">12.8 Mounting</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!implementation!mounting
-->

Data on a partition is not available to the file system until it is mounted
on a mount point. This can be done manually using <CODE>mount</CODE> or automatically
during booting by adding appropriate lines to <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE>. Read the
manual for <CODE>mount</CODE> and pay close attention to the tabulation.

During the booting process the system mounts all partitions
as described in the <CODE>fstab</CODE> file which can look something
like this:

<P>This file is somewhat sensitive to the formatting used so it
is best and also most convenient to edit it using one of the
editing tools made for this purpose,
such as

and
<A HREF="http://kfstab.purespace.de/kfstab/">kfstab</A>, an editing tool for KDE.
<P>Briefly, the fields are partition name, where to mount the partition,
type of file system, mount options, when to dump for backup
and when to do <CODE>fsck</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="ss12.11">12.11 Recommendations</A>
</H2>

<P>Having constructed and implemented your clever scheme
you are well advised to make a complete record of it all, on paper.
After all having all the necessary information on disk is no use
if the machine is down.
<P>Partition tables can be damaged or lost, in which case it is
excruciatingly important that you enter the exact same numbers
into <CODE>fdisk</CODE> so you can rescue your system.
You can use the program <CODE>printpar</CODE> to make a clear record
of the tables. Also write down the SCSI numbers or IDE names
for each disk so you can put the system together again in the
right order.
<P>There is also a small script in appendix
<A HREF="Multi-Disk-HOWTO-33.html#disk-documenter">Appendix M: Disk System Documenter</A>
which will generate a summary of your disk configurations.
<P>For checking your hard disks you can use the Disk Advisor boot disk
available
<A HREF="http://www.ontrack.com/">on the net</A>.
The disk builder required Windows to run. This system is useful to
diagnose failed disks.
<P>You are strongly recommended to make a rescue disk and <EM>test</EM> it.
Most distributions make on available and is often part of the
installation disks. For some, such as the one for Redhat 6.1 the way
to invoke the disk as a rescue disk is to type <EM>linux rescue</EM>
at the boot prompt.
<P>There are also specialised rescue disk distributions available
on the net.
<P>When need for it comes you will need to know where your root and boot
partitions reside which you need to write down and keep safe.
<P>Note: the difference between a boot disk and a rescue disk is that
a boot disk will fail if it cannot mount the file system, typically
on your hard disk. A rescue disk is self contained and will work
even if there are no hard disks.
