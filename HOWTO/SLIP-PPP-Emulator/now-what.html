>    Hey, if all went well, you are now connected to the Net! Try a 
    'telnet remotehostname' (remember that abbreviation in your hosts file?). 
    You should get the remotes telnet login prompt. Go on, try it! You can now 
    telnet/FTP/etc. anywhere on the Net from your local machine. How? Your 
    machine is using the remote as a nameserver to resolve addresses 
    (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>resolv.conf</TT
>). Experiment, find out what works and 
    what doesn't.
   </P
><P
>    You will not be able to use services that are not provided 
    already on your remote host! For example, if your server doesn't allow 
    telnets, chances are you can't do it either. Why? Because the emulator is 
    only re-directing what is already available.

>    My pick for 'Best Mail Reader, X Based' has to go to XFmail. This
    has now gotten out of beta, and rocks. Easy to install; requires no local
    mail system be installed (but will work with local spools) because it has
    POP built in - no more popclient/fetchpop! Easy to use; totally 
    customizable 
    from the GUI. Also supports MIME. Get it from

>    The text based News Reader
    <A
HREF="ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slrn"

>SLRN</A
> is fairly simple to
    install and use.  It is a true NNTP newsreader, which means 
    <EM
>no local news transport is required</EM
> to make it work 
    (you don't have install
    Cnews or INN). It does require that you have access to an NNTPserver,
    naturally, but most ISPs have this. It is text based, but has
    color and mouse support, and runs fine in an rxvt window.

>    The X based News Reader
    <A
HREF="http://www.matematik.su.se/~kjj/"

>KNews</A
> is 
    almost perfect. As with SLRN above, no local transport is required, but 
    an NNTP server is. It's at least worth a look.
