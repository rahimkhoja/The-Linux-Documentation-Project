>    A word about the form of the wait and sends. If it isn't clear by 
    the example, here's what's happening:

    <P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>wait ogin: 60</DT
><DD
><P
>         The script will wait for the remote to send 'ogin:' for 60 
         seconds. When it gets it, the script advances. If it doesn't get 
         it, it will advance after the timeout of 60 seconds.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>if $errlvl != 0 goto login_error</DT
><DD
><P
>       (This whole line is optional.)
        If the script is advancing because it got what it was waiting for, 
        this gets skipped. if the script is advancing because it timed out, 
	it will go to where you tell it to ('login_error1' in this case.
       </P
></DD
><DT
>send "LOGIN"\n</DT
><DD
><P
>        DIP will send 'LOGIN' and a newline
       </P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
>
   </P
><P
>    You can put in sleep statements if you need to, like this:
    "sleep 10" This will make the script pause for 10 seconds.
   </P
><P
>    After editing this file, rename it, say, remote.dip and put it in 
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/root</TT
>.  Then, as root, run 
    'dip remote'. Use the -v flag the first 
    time to debug it ('dip -v remote'), this will show you all the steps 
    dip takes.
   </P
><P
>    Dip will only run as root, but there is a way to make it run from 
    a user account. For now, if you need this info, ask. I may include it in 
    this file later if enough people want it.
   </P
><P
>    If dip errors out right away, try removing the comments from the 
    script.

NAME="PPP"
>4.4. PPP</A
></H2
><P
>    The above gets you rolling with CSLIP, which is really fine 
    most of the time. It truly is easy to get working, since the protocol is 
    supported at the kernel level - just make sure it's in there and it 
    works.
   </P
><P
>    However, some of you will want PPP, for what reasons, only you can
    say. I'm not going to tell you how to set it up here, there's a whole
    other HOWTO written just for that. What I will do is tell you what the 
    gotchas are when using PPP with an emulator.
   </P
><P
>    First, the latest version of DIP says you can use it to start PPP,
    and you can, BUT it only starts the PPP daemon - no flags, nothing. So if
    you want to use DIP to start PPP, be sure to put all of your startup info
    in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp/options</TT
> file, or it won't work.
   </P
><P
>    Speaking of the options file, one of the things that MUST be in 
    there no matter how you start pppd is this: '192.0.2.1:XXX.XXX.XX.XX'. 
    What this is is 'localIPaddress:remoteIPaddress'. You need it there 
    because normally pppd can fill in the blank itself, but fails when 
    connecting to an emulator.
   </P
><P
>    Be sure to get the latest and greatest pppd package. It seems 
    there were a few versions recently that had a bit of trouble.
   </P
><P
>    Lastly, unless you have a good reason to use PPP, or just want to 
    learn how it works, you really don't need it. I have tried them both, and 
    didn't notice any performance difference with the standard set of 
    clients. Of course, Your Mileage May Vary. :)
