<P>Hey, you made it to the end! (Phew...)  Now just the legal stuff.

<P>This document is Copyright (c) 1995-1999 by Paul Gortmaker.
Copying and redistribution is allowed under the conditions as
outlined in the Linux Documentation Project Copyright, available
from where you obtained this document, OR as outlined in the
GNU General Public License, version 2 (see linux/COPYING).
<P>This document is <EM>not</EM> gospel. However, it is probably the most
up to date info that you will be able to find. Nobody is responsible
for what happens to your hardware but yourself. If your stuff
goes up in smoke, or anything else bad happens, 
we take no responsibility. ie. THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED DUE TO ACTIONS TAKEN BASED ON THE
INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS DOCUMENT.
<P>A hint to people considering doing a translation.  First,
translate the SGML source (available via FTP from the HowTo
main site) so that you can then generate other output formats.
Be sure to keep a copy of the original English SGML source that
you translated from! When an updated HowTo is released,
get the new SGML source for that version, and then a simple
<CODE>diff -u old.sgml new.sgml</CODE> will show you exactly what has
changed so that you can easily incorporate those changes into
your translated SMGL source without having to re-read or
re-translate everything.
<P>If you are intending to incorporate this document into a
published work, please make contact (via e-mail) so that
you can be supplied with the most up to date information
available. In the past, out of date versions of the Linux
HowTo documents have been published, which caused the developers
undue grief from being plagued with questions that were already
answered in the up to date versions.

<P>If you have found any glaring typos, or outdated info in this
document, please let me know. It is easy to overlook stuff,
as the kernel (and the number of drivers) is huge compared
to what it was when I started this.
<P>Thanks,
