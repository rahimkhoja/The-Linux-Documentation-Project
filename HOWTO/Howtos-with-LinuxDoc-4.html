<P>Before reading this section it's best to have at least an
elementary knowledge of tags in markup languages.  So if you don't
know much about this, you may first want to look at 
<A HREF="Howtos-with-LinuxDoc-5.html#example_1">Example 1</A> for LinuxDoc markup.</P>
<P>One way to compare is to inspect real HOWTOs at the LDP site.  Click
on either 
<A HREF="http://cvs.tldp.org/go.to/LDP/LDP/howto/docbook/">DocBook Index</A> or 
<A HREF="http://cvs.tldp.org/go.to/LDP/LDP/howto/linuxdoc/">LinuxDoc Index</A> to find them.  You'll notice that the DocBook docs are
cluttered with tags while the LinuxDoc docs have far fewer tags and
are thus more readable and easier to write and modify.  Some documents
at LDP are marked up much more clearly than others so you should
inspect at least a few documents.</P>
<P>You may at first think that DocBook is more advanced since there are
so many more tags but this isn't necessarily so.  If you create a
document in LinuxDoc and convert it to DocBook (by computer) there
will be many more tags in the DocBook version, including new tags that
were not in the LinuxDoc version.  Why?  Because LinuxDoc permits the
omission of tags while DocBook doesn't.  And in this way LinuxDoc is
more flexible and advanced than DocBook.  Not only does LinuxDoc often
allow the omission of end-tags like &lt;/title> but allows the
omission of both start and end tag pairs.  For example, in LinuxDoc
paragraphs are normally separated by blank lines instead of pairs of
paragraph tags &lt;p> (&lt;para> in DocBook) so that paragraph
tags are seldom needed.  Another example is just after the start of
a new section of a LinuxDoc document.  You just type in the title of
the section after the &lt;sect> tag while DocBook requires one to
also enclose the title in a pair of &lt;title> tags.</P>
<P>When one runs a program to convert LinuxDoc to say HTML, the first
thing the program does is to find all the omitted tags and add them to
the document.  For example, a pair of tags are added which are
equivalent to the pair of &lt;title> tags after a &lt;sect> tag
(including the cases of &lt;sect1> tags, etc.).  So in a sense,
LinuxDoc also has a lot of tags, but they are hidden from the user to
make the document both much easier to write and read.  In most cases,
the author writing a document in LinuxDoc is unaware of the existence
of most of the missing tags.  There's no need (in most cases) for the
author to know about them since they exist only in the computer memory
(or a temporary file) when the PC is converting LinuxDoc to some other
format (like to HTML).  Well, it is possible to save a file showing
the added tags but that is done mainly by programmers debugging the
LinuxDoc computer code (or by people like me that are curious about
how it works).</P>
<P>The DocBook tags are often longer than the equivalent LinuxDoc tags
such as &lt;em> instead of &lt;emphasis>.  For a short
comparison see the author's website 
<A HREF="http://www.lafn.org/~dave/linux/ld_vs_db.txt">Comparison of DocBook to LinuxDoc</A></P>
<P>However, the fact that many tags are omitted when writing LinuxDoc (but
are found by the software) is only one reason why LinuxDoc documents
have fewer tags.  Another reason is that DocBook actually has many
more tags to use than LinuxDoc does.  For example, LinuxDoc has just
one tag for the author's name while DocBook has separate tags for the
first middle and last names.  So in this sense DocBook is more
powerful than LinuxDoc but in another sense it's weaker since it can't
find missing tags.  The solution to this dilemma would be to merge
LinuxDoc with DocBook so as to retain the advantages of each.  DocBook
would then need to abandon it's current status as a "xml" language
since xml prohibits the omission of tags, etc. while sgml allows it.</P>
<P>One reason why omitted tags are not allowed in DocBook is that it makes
it easier for programmers to write software to parse it and convert it
to other formats.  There is no need for software capable of finding
and adding missing tags.  But making it easier for programmers, makes
it more difficult for the much large number of writers that have to
use DocBook.</P>
<P>There are special editors or word processors like Lyx and Bluefish
that make it easier to type DocBook documents.  For example, Bluefish
automatically adds end tags.  But for people who don't want to learn a
new editor or word processor, LinuxDoc is a lot easier since one can
type in the tags by hand or create a set of macros to insert the
(&lt;emphasis> tags.  I use the vim editor and if I type ;s it
inserts the &lt;sect1> tag.  ;r does &lt;sect>, ;i does
&lt;item>, etc.  For the header tags on the first several lines of
the document, I just copy them from another document and change the
words after the tags.  Of course I don't need to change the author's
name or email.  So a major advantage of LinuxDoc is that one can
easily use it with the same editor or word processor that they
currently use and know.</P>
<P>Some people who don't understand the situation have advocated making
DocBook about as easy as LinuxDoc by just using a subset of the
DocBook tags.  This doesn't work because DocBook will still require
a few times as many tags to get the same results due to the
requirement of DocBook to not permit any omitted tags.</P>
<P>In spite of the advantages of LinuxDoc, the number of people who use
DocBook greatly exceeds the number using LinuxDoc partly because
Linuxdoc was promoted by book publishers.  There's a program by Reuben
Thomas (ld2db) which can convert LinuxDoc documents to DocBook.  It's
not perfect and you will likely need to do some manual editing.  The
LDP also automatically converts a LinuxDoc HOWTO to DocBook after you
submit it.  It would be nice to have another program to automatically
convert DocBook docs to LinuxDoc so they can be modified by people
using the simpler LinuxDoc markup.</P>
