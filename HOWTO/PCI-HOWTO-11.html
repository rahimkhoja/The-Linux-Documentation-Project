<P>
<P>If you have some moneny to put into your machine, you'd be well off
with a Pentium90, ASUS-SP4, which is what I use at the moment. If you
can afford 32M RAM that would be much better than 16M RAM. 
<P>Real soon now the upcoming standard will be the Triton Chipset with
support for special SIMMS called EDODRAM, and SRAM. Both will be more
expensive than PS2-RAM, and at the time of writing (28-June-1995) SRAM is not
available. While EDO-DRAM is more expensive, this is not because of the 
production costs, they are said to be the same.  
<P>For a highperformance system I would still choose an ASUS-TP4/XE with EDO-DRAM,
but if you do not need to use it at the moment, I d rather wait some more.
<P>For Graphic-boards I'd say the best cheap board fitting perfectly on a
good Multisync-15 like the Samsung SyncMaster 15Gli, is the SPEA V7 Mirage
P64 with Trio64 Chipset and 2M DRAM. For more sophisticated Display
like the Iiyama-IDEK 8617A-T I think the PCI Mach64 ATI-GUP-Turbo
(not the cheaper GUP-Turbo-Windows) would be a 
good choice, with 4M RAM you can have truecolor in higher
resolutions. It is well supported in the XFree86(tm)-3.1.1, and there
are commercial X-Servers available of which I'd recommend
Accelerated/X by Roell, which supports the Mach64 very well and fast. 
<P>For SCSI I'd take the DPT rather than the (much cheaper and very fast)
NCR53c810 in case you plan to use SCSI-Tapes a lot. The NCR53c810
driver on Linux does lack disconnect/reconnect support, thus blocking
the SCSIbus on operations like "mt rewind", "mt fsf" etc. It bears a
performance penalty on tar-operations - but check out Drews new alpha
drivers before making a decision, perhaps it does solve all the problems.
<P>For building servers, the DPT
would be the controller of choice anyway because of all the nifty
hardware cache (with elevator sorting on accesses, so cache it is not a silly
thing even in a Linux enviroment where the OS does the caching) and RAID-Support
up to raid level 5. 
<P>If you do not want to spend that much money on computer equipment
(e.g.: you are having a life) you might go for an ASUS-SP3-SiS with
AMD-DX2/66 or DX4/100. The SPEA V7 Mirage P64 PCI with 2M DRAM would
be a good choice, since it uses the Trio64 S3 Chip, which is well
supported by XFree86(tm)-3.1.1, quite cheap to buy and fast, too. 
<P>Another fine card since XFree86(tm)-3.1 is the fast and cheap et4000/w32-PCI-card.
