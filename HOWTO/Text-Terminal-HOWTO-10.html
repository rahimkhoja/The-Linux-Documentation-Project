<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.1">Intro to Terminal Emulation</A>
</H2>

<P> A trivial type of terminal emulation is where you set up a real
terminal to emulate another brand/model of terminal.  To do this you
select the emulation you want (called "personality" in Wyse jargon)
from the terminal's set-up menu.  This section will not discuss this
case.</P>
<P>Since a PC has a screen and keyboard (as does a real terminal) but
also has much more computing power, it's easy to use some of this
computing power to make the PC computer behave like a real text
terminal.   Still a third type is where you just use a text-based
interface (at the console --usually just the monitor) to your Linux
PC, either by a terminal screen (such as xterm) in Xwindow or by a
"virtual terminal".  </P>
<P>To fully emulate a real terminal on a PC requires that a serial
port of the computer will be used to connect the emulated terminal to
another computer.  This would be either with a direct cable connection
from serial port to serial port, or via a modem.  But in other cases,
the serial port will not be used directly as the interface.  Instead,
the interface may be a network and the flow of bytes to and from the
terminal will travel in network packets via either a modem on a serial
port or via an ethernet port.</P>
<P>Emulation for connection to a remote computer provides more that just
a real text-terminal since the PC doing the emulation can also do
other tasks at the same time it's emulating a terminal.  For example,
for serial port connections, kermit or zmodem may be run on the PC to
enable transfer of files over the serial line (and possibly over the
phone line via a modem) to the other computer that you are connected
to.  The emulation needs only to be run on one of the virtual consoles
of the PC, leaving the other virtual consoles available for using the
PC in command-line-interface.</P>
<P>For Linux see 
<A HREF="#pc_as_terminal">Make a Linux PC a serial port terminal</A>.  Emulation software for this also available for use
under MS Windows.  See 
<A HREF="#non_linux_pc">Make a non-Linux PC a terminal</A>  This can be used to connect a Windows PC (as a
Text-Terminal) to a Linux PC.</P>
<P>Most Linux free software can only emulate a VT100, VT102, or
VT100/ANSI, xterm, pterm, or Wyse60 (but not fully).  Since most PC's
have color monitors while VT100 and VT102 were designed for a
monochrome monitor, the emulation usually adds color capabilities
(including a choice of colors).  Sometimes the emulation is not 100%
perfect but this usually causes few problems.  None of them provide
programmable function keys.  The non-free emulation software running
under MS Windows can emulate many more terminals than free Linux can.</P>

<H2><A NAME="term_not_for_emulation"></A> <A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.2">Don't Try to Use TERM Variable for Emulation</A>
 </H2>

<P> Some have erroneously thought that they could create an emulator
at a Linux console (monitor) by setting the environment variable TERM
to the type of terminal they would like to emulate.  This does not
work.  The value of TERM only tells an application program what
terminal you are using.  This way it doesn't need to interactively ask
you this question (and it's too dumb to be able to probe the terminal to
find out what type it is).  If you're at a Linux PC monitor (command
line interface) it's a terminal of type "Linux", and since you can't
change this, TERM must be set to "Linux".  But this "Linux" should be
set automatically, without you needing to do anything.</P>
<P>If you set it to something else, you are fibbing to an application
program.  As a result, it will incorrectly interpret certain escape
sequences from the console resulting in a corrupted interface.  Since
the Linux console behaves almost like a vt100 terminal, it could still
work almost OK if you falsely claimed it was a vt100 (or some other
terminal which is close to a vt100).  In this case it may seeming work
OK most of the time but once in a while will give errors.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.3">Serial Communication programs </A>
</H2>

<P>while the newer free PuTTY and Terra-Term programs can connect
directly to a serial line but can't dial out, most of of the older
programs did dialing out via a serial port modem.  Some dialing
programs are for making a PPP connection to the Internet via a modem,
such as wvdial, and don't normally include any terminal emulation.
But some other programs (such as minicom or seyon) do both terminal
emulation and modem dialing (without PPP so it's not easy to use them
to connect to the internet).  But since these programs connect to a
modem via a specified serial port (including "internal" serial ports
that have no connector on the back of the PC), they may be used to
connect to a serial line via a possible serial port connector on the
back of a PC.  For this case you just set them up to connect without
dialing a phone number.  The program "picocom" just does terminal
emulation although it's possible to type in a modem command and a
phone number to dial out manually.  These programs are also useful for
testing modems.  Seyon is only for use with X Window and can emulate
Tektronix 4014 terminals.  In the past (before the Internet was
widespread) one could use dialing programs to dial up some public
libraries to use their catalogs and indexes, or even read magazine
articles on line.  But today such activity is almost always done using
the Internet where there is a much larger choice of connections and no
long-distance telephone bills.  </P>
<P>The communication program C-Kermit (sometimes just called kermit)
doesn't do terminal emulation for Linux (in 2006).  But Kermit can
emulate many terminals in its non-free MS Windows versions so you`ll
see lots of claims that Kermit can do terminal emulation.  With Linux,
it's merely a semi-transparent pipe between whatever terminal you are
on and the remote site you are connected to.  Thus if you use kermit
on a Linux PC the terminal type will be "Linux".  If you have a Wyse60
connected to your PC and run kermit from that, you will appear as a
Wyse60 to the remote computer (which may not be able to handle Wyse60
terminals).  Minicom emulates a VT102 and if you use it on Wyse60
terminal vt102 the remote host will think you are a vt102 and send you
vt102 escape sequences.  These will flow into your computer's serial
port and will get translated to the Wyse escape sequences before going
out another serial port on your computer to your Wyse60 terminal.
C-Kermit can't do this sort of thing.</P>
<P>Emulators exist under DOS such as <CODE>telix</CODE> and <CODE>procomm</CODE> work
just as well.  The terminal emulated is often the old VT100, VT102, or
ANSI (like VT100).</P>

<H3>Emulation under X Window</H3>

<P>There are many terminal emulation programs (such as xterm, uxterm.
gnome-terminal, and konsole) which may be run under X Window.  They can
usually emulate a VT102, but some may be able to emulate at VT220, or
Tektronix 4014.  They provide a command line interface to the computer
but they don't communicate via the serial port like a text terminal.
See 
<A HREF="http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/virtual/x-terminal-emulator">Ubuntu -- x-terminal-emulator</A> for a brief list of such
emulators.  Some are multilingual.  Your Linux distribution has likely
installed one for you.</P>

<H3>Real terminals once were better</H3>

<P> Unless one was using X Window with a large display, a real
terminal was often nicer to use than emulating one.  It often had
better resolution for text (since it's monochrome), and had no disk
drives to make annoying noises.  Today, the resolution of modern color
displays is better than that of the old text-terminals and disk drives
are quieter.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.4">10.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.4">Testing Terminal Emulation</A>
</H2>

<P> For the VT series terminals there is a test program: <CODE>vttest</CODE>
to help determine if a terminal behaves correctly like a vt53, vt100,
vt102, vt220, vt320, vt420 etc.  There is no documentation but it has
menus and is easy to use.  To compile it run the configure script and
then type "make".  It may be downloaded from: 
<A HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="console_"></A> <A NAME="ss10.5">10.5</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.5">The Linux Console </A>
</H2>

<P> The console for a PC Linux system is normally the computer monitor
in text mode.  It emulates a terminal of type "Linux" and the escape
sequences it uses are in the man page: console_codes.  There is no way
to make this interface emulate anything else.  But of course you can run
emulation software on your PC so that the monitor and keyboard will
emulate a text terminal while that software program is running.
Setting the TERM environment variable to any type of terminal other
than "Linux" will not result in emulating that other terminal.  It
will only result in a corrupted interface since you have falsely
declared (via the TERM variable) that your "terminal" is of a type
different from what it actually is: Linux.  See 
<A HREF="#term_not_for_emulation">Don't Use TERM For Emulation</A></P>
<P>In X Window, using a terminal emulator gives you the equivalent of a
console.  For KDE they chose to call this emulation "konsole".
In some cases, the console for a Linux PC is a text-terminal.  One may
recompile Linux to make a terminal receive most of the messages which
normally go to the console.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-18.html#term_as_console">Make a Serial Terminal the Console</A>.</P>
<P>The "Linux" emulation of the monitor is flexible and has features
which go well beyond those of the vt102 terminal which it was intended
to emulate.  These include the ability to use custom fonts and easily
re-map the keyboard.  These extra features reside in the console
driver software (including the keyboard driver).  The console driver
only works for the monitor and will not work for a real terminal even
if it's being used for the console.  Thus the "console driver" is
really a "monitor driver".  In the early days of Linux one couldn't
use a real terminal as the console so "monitor" and "console" were
once always the same thing.</P>
<P>The stty commands work for the monitor-console just like it was a real
terminal.  They are handled by the same terminal driver that is used
for real terminals.  Bytes headed for the screen first go thru the
terminal (tty) driver and then thru the console driver.  For the monitor
some of the stty commands don't do anything (such as setting the baud rate).
You may set the monitor baud rate to any allowed value (such as a slow
300 speed) but the actual speed of putting text on the monitor screen
will not actually change.  The file /etc/ioctl.save stores stty
settings for use only when the console is in single user mode (but you
are normally in multiuser-user mode).  This is explained (a little) in the
init man page.</P>
<P>Many commands exist to utilize the added features provided by the
console-monitor driver.   Real terminals, which use neither scan codes
nor VGA cards, unfortunately can't use these features.  To find out
more about the console see the Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.  Also see
the various man pages about the console (type "man -k console").
Unfortunately, much of this documentation is outdated.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.6">10.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.6">Emulation Software</A>
</H2>

<P> Since there are free programs to emulate the most common
terminals, you will unlikely need to use any non-free software.  But
if you need to purchase software you should try to throughly check out
what other customers have to say about it.</P>

<H3><A NAME="pc_as_terminal"></A> Make a Linux PC a serial port terminal  </H3>

<P> Unless you want to emulate the standard vt100
(or close to it), xterm, or a Wyse 60, there doesn't seem to be much
free terminal emulation software available for Linux.  The free
programs are minicom, picocom, and for GUI: seyon and PuTTY.  Seyon
can emulate either xterm or vt100 while PuTTy uses its own termcap
(terminfo) named "putty" (put the terminal type "putty" in
/etc/inittab).  Putty's "pterm" can be used as a replacement for
xterm.</P>
<P>PuTTY is much newer than most other emulations and a major use of it
is as an SSH client but you can set its configuration for a serial
port connection.  Seyon is much older but with more features (some of
which are seldom needed).  There are also more recent (but weaker)
"emulators" for a GUI interface: gtkterm and cutecom, neither of which
can emulate any terminal except of type "dumb" ??).  Seyon can also
emulate a Tektronix 4014 terminal.  For Wyse see 
<A HREF="http://gutschke.com/wy60/">Wyse 60 emulator</A>.</P>
<P>Both gtkterm (and likely cutecom) don't use escape sequences, and
might be said to emulate a terminal of type "dumb" so they would be
quite slow if used as a text terminal for editing files on the host
computer using the vim editor, etc.  gtkterm is simple to set up and
very weak in capabilities but it does show its current status at the
bottom of the screen.</P>
<P>Minicom, PuTTY, picocom, gtkterm, or cutecom may be used to emulate a
directly connected terminal by simply starting one of them.  For
minicom, you must configure it for the serial port used).  Picocom is
like a mini-minicom and doesn't have automatic dialout capability.
Gtkterm might be called a "mini-mini-minicom".</P>
<P>Minicom : For the case of minicom you obviously don't try to dial-out.
When you want to quit minicom (after you logout from the other PC) you
use minicom's q command to quit without reset since there is no modem
to reset.  When minicom starts, it automatically sends out a modem
init string to the serial port.  But since there's no modem there, the
string gets put after the "login:" prompt.  If this string is mostly
capital letters, the getty program (which runs login) at the other PC
may think that your terminal has only capital letters and try to use
only capital letters.  To avoid this, configure the modem init strings
sent by minicom to null (erase the init strings).</P>
<P>The non-free terminal emulator "Procomm" (which is from the MS world),
can be used on a Linux PC if you run dosemu to emulate Dos or possibly
in a mode emulating MS Windows.  The last version of it seems to be
4.8 released in around 2000 so it will likely not work with modern MS
systems.  It was sold by Symantec which has many files supporting it
which may be found using their search engine at 
<A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/">http://www.symantec.com/</A>.  And if you check the Internet (in
2008), it's still being sold here and there.</P>
<P>There was a specialized Linux distribution: Serial Terminal Linux.  It
would turn a PC to into a minicom-like terminal.  It's small (fits on a
floppy) and will not let you use the PC for any other purpose (when it's
running).  The link to it is broken, but one similar to it (in 2013),
but on CD, is 
<A HREF="http://www.asashi.net/pages/pitux.html">ASASHI DOT NET: PITUX, micro SERIAL TERMINAL LINUX</A></P>
<P>TERM (non-free commercial software from Century Software) 
<A HREF="http://www.centurysoftware.com/terminal_emulator/advanced_terminal_emulator.php">Terminal Emulator</A>  can emulate Wyse60, 50; VT 220, 102, 100,
52: TV950, 925, 912; PCTERM; ANSI; IBM3101; ADM-1l; WANG 2110.  Block
mode is available for IBM and Wyse.  It runs on a Linux PC.</P>

<H3>Make a Linux PC an IBM network terminal</H3>

<P>This happens automatically when you run programs like telnet or
ssh, provided of course that your computer is connected to a network
(perhaps via a modem).  Telnet normally uses a network (often the
Internet) to connect your console, which emulates a terminal of type
"Linux", to a remote computer for you to log in to.  However, there
are some  free programs that allow you to use telnet with IBM terminal
emulation on your PC to connect with IBM mainframes.</P>
<P>One IBM program emulates an IBM tn5250 terminal and printer and
another emulates an IBM c3270.  There's also one that emulates an IBM
pr3287 printer (the mainframe thinks it's connected to the printer).
The Debian distribution has these.  It's reported that the tn5250
emulates a vt keyboard under Linux and not a 5250 keyboard like it
should.  Also, it's reported that the documentation and keyboard
mapping for the MS Windows version are better than for the Linux
version.</P>

<H3><A NAME="non_linux_pc"></A> Make a non-Linux PC a terminal </H3>

<P> Emulators exist which run on non-Linux PCs.  They permit you to
use a non-Linux-PC as a terminal to connected to a Linux-PC.  Under DOS
there were many programs that not only emulated a terminal but let you
dial out with a modem so that you could connect to other computers
over telephone lines (without getting connected to the Internet).  Of
historical interest is an article in Byte magazine from Feb 1994
entitled "DOS Serial Communications.  It was onetime at
http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec8/art1.htm.</P>
<P>Today Windows comes with "HyperTerminal" (formerly simply called
"Terminal" in Windows 3.x and DOS).  Competing with this is both the
free (open source) PuTTY and the non-free "HyperTerminal Private
Edition" 
<A HREF="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/index.html">http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/index.html</A> which is
non-free to business.  It can emulate vt-220.  PuTTY emulates xterm and
supposedly also vt-102 but it doesn't have file transfer capabilities
(such as zmodem) like HyperTerminal does.  But PuTTY permits a display
with a height of over 24 lines (set the Linux shell variable LINES to
say 32 by typing: LINES=32).  Turbosoft's TTWin (non-free) can emulate
over 80 different terminals under Windows.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.ttwin.com/">http://www.ttwin.com/</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.turbosoft.com.au/">http://www.turbosoft.com.au/</A> (Australia).  See also 
<A HREF="http://www.wrq.com/">WRQ</A></P>
<P>For using a Mac computer to emulate a common terminal use either
PuTTY, Linux's "minicom" (ported to the  Mac OS X) or the old "zterm"
(shareware).  For very old Macs prior to OS X, see the mini-howto:
Mac-Terminal.  
<A HREF="http://www.carnationsoftware.com/carnation/HT.Carn.Home.html">Carnation Software</A> has non-free software to emulate a wide
variety of terminals on a Mac.  Mac OS X has a "terminal" program that
gives you a terminal window just like the xterm window in Linux's X
Window.  In that window you may run "minicom" (if it's available).
Both the "fink" and "darwinports" projects have ported minicom to the
Mac, but they may not have the most recent version and you might need
to compile minicom yourself.</P>


<H2><A NAME="colors"></A> <A NAME="ss10.7">10.7</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc10.7">Colors on Emulated Terminals </A>
</H2>

<P>Since displays used for text terminal emulation are almost always
color displays, you can utilize color coding of words.  Besides
displaying directories this way (See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#ls_color">Example for ls Function</A>) some other Linux programs display color-coded text.
It seems to mostly happen without any configuring but there may be
color conflicts.  For example, if you have set the background color
green, then if a programs sends you green text, it will be difficult
or impossible to read.</P>
<P>Color usually works by programs sending ANSI escape sequences to the
terminal.  One might think that an emulated terminal would show the
ANSI escape codes in the 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#termcap1">terminfo</A>.
for the terminal.  But this is not usually the case since if a terminal
support colors it seems to be assumed that these color will be sent to
the terminal using the ANSI encoding.</P>
<P>If you want to see what these encodings are, look at "man
console_codes".  The ECMA-48 color codes in this man page appear to be
a subset of the ANSI color codes.  For excruciating details see 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI escape code - Wikipedia</A>.  Note that these ANSI codes cover more than just
colors.</P>
<P>For PuTTY one can select the precise color to display for every ANSI
code by using the settings menu and clicking on "Colours".  For
example if you have your screen background light green, then you can
remap that ANSI color to some shade of brown that you select.  Note
that light green is called "Green Bold".  It's bold because it
contains a lot of white which makes it a light color.</P>
