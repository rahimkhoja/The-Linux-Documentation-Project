<P>When properly used, these programs allow you to parse complex languages with
ease. This is a great boon when you want to read a configuration file, or
want to write a compiler for any language you (or anyone else) might have
invented.
<P>With a little help, which this document will hopefully provide, you will
find that you will never write a parser again by hand - Lex &amp; YACC are
the tools to do this.

</H2>

<P>Although these programs shine when used together, they each serve a
different purpose. The next chapter will explain what each part does.
