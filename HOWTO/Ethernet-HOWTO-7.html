<H2><A NAME="tech-intro"></A> <A NAME="s7">7. Technical Information</A></H2>

<P>
<P>For those who want to understand a bit more about how the card
works, or play with the present drivers, this
information should be useful. If you do not fall into this category,
then perhaps you will want to skip this section.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="data-xfer"></A> <A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Programmed I/O vs. Shared Memory vs. DMA</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you can already send and receive back-to-back packets, you just
can't put more bits over the wire. Every modern ethercard can receive
back-to-back packets. The Linux DP8390 drivers (wd80x3, SMC-Ultra,
3c503, ne2000, etc) come pretty close to
sending back-to-back packets (depending on the current interrupt
latency) and the 3c509 and AT1500 hardware have no problem at all
automatically sending back-to-back packets.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Programmed I/O (e.g. NE2000, 3c509)</H3>

<P>
<P>Pro: Doesn't use any constrained system resources,
just a few I/O registers, and has no 16M limit.
<P>Con: Usually the slowest transfer rate, the CPU is waiting
the whole time, and interleaved packet access is usually
difficult to impossible.
<P>
<H3>Shared memory (e.g. WD80x3, SMC-Ultra, 3c503)</H3>

<P>
<P>Pro: Simple, faster than programmed I/O, and allows random
access to packets. Where possible,
the linux drivers compute the checksum of
incoming IP packets as they are copied off the card, resulting in
a further reduction of CPU usage vs. an equivalent PIO card.
<P>Con: Uses up memory space (a big one for DOS users, essentially
a non-issue under Linux), and it still ties up the CPU.
<P>
<H3>Bus Master Direct Memory Access (e.g. LANCE, DEC 21040) </H3>

<P>
<P>Pro: Frees up the CPU during the data transfer, can string
together buffers, can require little or no CPU time lost on
the ISA bus.  Most of the bus-mastering linux drivers now use
a `copybreak' scheme where large packets are put directly into
a kernel networking buffer by the card, and small packets are
copied by the CPU which primes the cache for subsequent
processing.
<P>Con: (Only applicable to ISA bus cards)
Requires low-memory buffers and a DMA channel for
cards. Any bus-master will have problems with other bus-masters
that are bus-hogs, such as some primitive SCSI adaptors. A few
badly-designed motherboard chipsets have problems with
ISA bus-masters. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Performance Implications of Bus Width</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The ISA bus can do 5.3MB/sec (42Mb/sec), which sounds like more than
enough for 10Mbps ethernet. In the case of the 100Mbps cards, you
clearly need a faster bus to take advantage of the network bandwidth.
a 33MHz 32 bit PCI bus can do 133MB/sec which isn't enough for GigE.
<P>
<H3>ISA Eight bit and ISA 16 bit Cards</H3>

<P>
<P>You probably will have a hard time buying a new ISA ethercard
anymore, but you can probably still find some surplus or
obsolete cards suitable for ``home-ethernet'' systems.
If you want to really go retro, you can even use an old
half slot 8 bit ISA card, but note most of them are 10Base-2.
<P>Some 8 bit cards that will provide adequate performance for
light to average use are the wd8003, the 3c503 and the ne1000.
The 3c501 provides poor performance, and these poor 15 year
old relics of the XT days should be avoided. (Send them to
Alan, he collects them...)
<P>The 8 bit data path doesn't hurt performance that much, as you
can still expect to get about 500 to 800kB/s ftp download speed
to an 8 bit wd8003 card (on a fast ISA bus) from a fast host.
And if most of your net-traffic is going to remote sites, then
the bottleneck in the path will be elsewhere, and the only speed
difference you will notice is during net activity on your local
subnet.
<P>
<H3>32 Bit PCI (VLB/EISA) Ethernet Cards</H3>

<P>
<P>Obviously a 32 bit interface to the computer is a must for
100Mbps and higher networks.  If you get into GigE, then
the 133 megabyte/sec PCI bus (for 33MHz 32 bit PCI) will still
be your limiting factor.
<P>But an older 10Mbs network 
doesn't really  require a 32 bit interface.
See 
<A HREF="#data-xfer">Programmed I/O vs. ...</A> as to why
having a 10Mbps ethercard on an 8MHz ISA bus is really not a
bottleneck. Even though having a slow ethercard on a fast bus won't
necessarily mean faster transfers, it will usually mean reduced
CPU overhead, which is good for multi-user systems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Performance Implications of Zero Copy</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>As network data is sent or received, you can easily imagine
it being copied to/from the application into kernel memory
and from there being copied to/from the card memory.  All
this data movement takes time and CPU resources.  As hinted
above in the Bus Master DMA section, a properly designed card
can cut down on all this copying, and the most ideal case
would be zero copy of course.  With some of the modern PCI
cards, zero copy is possible by simply pointing the card at
the data and essentially saying "get it yourself."  If maximum
performance with minimum server load is important to you then
check to see if your hardware and driver will support zero copy.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Performance Implications of Hardware Checksums</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There is no guarantee that your data will travel from 
computer A to computer B without being corrupted.  To
make sure the data is OK, the sender adds up all the
numbers that make up your data, and sends this checksum
along as well. The receiver recomputes this checksum
and compares it to the one the sender computed. If the
two don't match, the receiver knows that the data has
been corrupted and it will reject the bad data.
<P>Computing these sums takes time and extra load on the 
main computer.  Some of the more fancy cards have the
ability to do these Rx and/or Tx sums in hardware, which 
allows the main CPU to offload this task to the card.  
<P>Cards that require a data copy don't benefit as much from 
hardware checksums, since the sum operation can be combined 
into the copy for only a minimal additional overhead.
Hence hardware Tx checksums are only used in zero copy 
(i.e. applications using <CODE>sendfile()</CODE>) situations,
and so hardware Rx checksums are currently more useful.
<P>Note that a reasonable computer can saturate a 100BaseT
link even when doing the copy and checksum itself, so
zerocopy/hw-checksum will only show up as decreased CPU use.
You would have to go to GigE to see a speed increase.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Performance Implications of NAPI (Rx interrupt mitigation)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When a card receives a packet from the network, what
usually happens is that the card asks the CPU for attention
by raising an interrupt. Then the CPU determines who caused
the interrupt, and runs the card's driver interrupt handler 
which will in turn read the card's interrupt status to determine 
what the card wanted, and then in this case, run the receive
portion of the card's driver, and finally exits.
<P>Now imagine you are getting lots of Rx data, say 10 thousand
packets per second all the time on some server.  You can
imagine that the above IRQ run-around into and out of the Rx
portion of the driver adds up to a lot of overhead.
A lot of CPU time could be saved by essentially turning off
the Rx interrupt and just hanging around in the Rx portion
of the driver, since it knows there is pretty much a steady
flow of Rx work to do.  This is the basic idea of NAPI.
<P>As of 2.6 kernels, some drivers have a config option to
enable NAPI. There is also some documentation in the 
<CODE>Documentation/networking</CODE> directory that comes with
the kernel.
