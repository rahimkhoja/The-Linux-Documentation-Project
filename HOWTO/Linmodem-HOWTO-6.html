<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Troubleshooting</A></H2>

<P>So you've read through this document, the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html">Modem-HOWTO</A>,
and the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO/index.html">PPP Howto</A>,
are pretty sure that your modem matches one of the drivers available,
but it still doesn't work?  There are a number of points in
the process at which something could break down.  
<P>Linux generally maintains records of networking connections which are
very useful in troubleshooting problems.  Their particular filenames
vary with both the Linux distribution and Dial-in software,
but
the system log files <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>, <CODE>/var/log/syslog</CODE>,
etcetera, should provide at least some information.
<P>For both
your own trouble shooting and queries for help to a list, it will be
useful if you accumulate the information requested below. As root, 
change to the directory in which the modem
install scripts are located, and 
start a
script record as shown below.  After this script is terminated
with "exit," copy it out of your Linux partition for transmission to the
list which may aid you. 
<P>(Below, # are explanatory comments.)
<PRE>
# start the recording,
script ModemTest.txt 
# type in as much info on your Modem card as you have
echo winmodem name, manufacturer, designation, and chip if possible
# this gives your current kernel version
uname -r
# this gives information on your serial ports
setserial -agv /dev/ttyS*
# this information on your interrupts (irq)
cat /proc/interrupts
# show the contents of your module installation script (insert script name):
cat ScriptName
# Check if your script is executable:
ls -l ScriptName
# a response is OK if it has "x" such as below:
# -rwxrw-rw-  1 root     root  654 Jan  6  2000 ltinst
# otherwise make it executable with:
chmod o+x ScriptName
# verify with
ls -l ScriptName
# if ScriptName has not been successfully run before under this kernel
# run it with:
./ScriptName
# what is the symbolic link /dev/modem set to:
ls -l /dev/modem
# What is the DeviceName specified in the ScriptName (/dev/ttyS14 or ...?)
echo DeviceName
# what is your modem driver name? Something like DriverName.o
# with the ".o" indicating it is a compiled binary
echo This is my DriverName.o
# if should have been inserted in the Modules Path
# Try to display it there with:
find /lib/modules | grep DriverName
# Is DriverName among the modules installed in the running kernel?
lsmod
# if not try a simple insertion:
insmod ./DriverName.o
# or if it was in the Modules Path, the following will suffice:
insmod DriverName
# check for insertion:
lsmod
# if not inserted, try forcing:
insmod -f ./DriverName
# list your inserted modules again.
lsmod
# If DriverName is NOT listed, 
# their is an incompatibility between modem hardware, driver and kernel.
# Further effort will be of No use.
# If DriverName is listed, let's do a bit more information.
# You may first wish to rerun the configuration utility 
# used to setup dial-in connections for your Linux installation.
# Remember to edit your PassWord from this record later.
# You will probably be queried for the following information 
# which you should have ready:
#Port to be used (/dev/modem or /dev/ttySn),Dial-inNumber, UserName, PassWord. 
# Run your configuration utility.
YourSetUpConf
# To stop recording 
exit
</PRE>
<P>If dialin was not successfull, append to this a record from your log file.
As an example, a section of a /var/log/syslog from a Debian
Linux system is below.
