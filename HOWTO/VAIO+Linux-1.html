<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Notes about different systems</A>
</H2>

<P>I've recently received some mail stating that some of contents in this
document is incorrect. It is because some reason, hardware installed on
more recent systems are slightly different than older systems. I will
start covering those information. But since of course, I don't have every
system in here, I would like to ask Sony VAIO owners to tell me more
information about it. This would help me a lot if you can put [VAIO
Information] in the beginning of the subject, so I can take extra
attention to it. Also, please include model number of the system. If it is
notebook, please include that information in a content, or in a subject. I
would like to apologize to ones that got confused by this document.

<P>Also most of procedures in this document is tested, I will
take no responsibilities for any problem caused by using any information
in this document. As like in GPL, please try anything in your own risk. I
am not native English writer, and you will find many mistakes in this
document. Please excuse me on those. Any corrections and clarifications

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What this document all about?</A>
</H2>

<P>In this HOWTO, I will go over how to use Linux under Sony VAIO
computers. The VAIO computers are great, but was not very friendly to
Linux.  But this isn't mean that you cannot use it, actually you can!
Throughout this document, I will assume that you own either PCV 70 or 90.
Since almost all VAIO models are similar in their architecture (although
newer ones have larger disks, updated video card, more RAM, etc), many of
contents in this document should apply to all VAIO models.
