<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The past</A>
</H2>

<P>More than 30 years ago Internet didn't exist. Interactive communications
were only made by telephone at PSTN line cost.
<P>Data exchange was expansive (for a long distance) and no one
had been thinking to video interactions (there was only television
that is not interactive, as known).
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Yesterday</A>
</H2>

<P>Few years ago we saw appearing some interesting things: PCs to
large masses, new technologies to communicate like cellular phones
and finally the great net: Internet; people begun to communicate
with new services like email, chat, etc. and business reborned with
the web allowing people buy with a "click".
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Today</A>
</H2>

<P>Today we can see a real revolution in communication world: everybody
begins to use PCs and Internet for job and free time to communicate
each other, to exchange data (like images, sounds, documents) and,
sometimes, to talk each other using applications like Netmeeting
or Internet Phone. Particularly starts to diffusing a common idea
that could be the future and that can allow real-time vocal communication:
VoIP.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 The future</A>
</H2>

<P>We cannot know what is the future, but we can try to image it
with many computers, Internet almost everywhere at high speed and
people talking (audio and video) in a real time fashion. We only
need to know what will be the means to do this: UMTS, VoIP (with
video extension) or other? Anyway we can notice that Internet has
grown very much in the last years, it is free (at least as international
means) and could be the right communication media for future.
