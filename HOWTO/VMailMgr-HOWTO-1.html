<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>VMailMgr (short for Virtual MAIL ManaGeR) is a package of programs designed to manage 
multiple domains of mail addresses and mailboxes on a single host. It co-operates with 
qmail for mail delivery and program control.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is VMailMgr and why should I use it?</A>
</H2>

<P>VMailMgr is:
<P>A series of utilities for managing virtual domains which include a password checking interface for qmail which 
replaces the usual checkpassword, and an authentication module 
for Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual mailboxes by one of 
three methods: 
<UL>
<LI> IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user) </LI>
<LI> username-based access (username-virtualuser) </LI>
<LI> hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or virtualuser:virtual.host) </LI>
</UL>
<P>You should use it if:
<P>You prefer to have each domain controlled by a seperate username,
allowing the use of system quotas and better security
