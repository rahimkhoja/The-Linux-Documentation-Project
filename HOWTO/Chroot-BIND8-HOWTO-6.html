<P>So, you had BIND 8.2.2_P7 all nicely chrooted and tweaked to your taste...
and then you hear this nasty rumour that there's a remotely-exploitable root
hole in that version too, and you need to upgrade to 8.2.3 right away.  Do
you have to go through this whole long process to install this new version?
<P>Nope.  In fact, you really just need the section on 
<A HREF="Chroot-BIND8-HOWTO-3.html#compiling">Compiling BIND</A> and the first two parts of the section on 
<A HREF="Chroot-BIND8-HOWTO-4.html#installing">Installing BIND</A> (installing the binaries outside and
inside the jail, respectively).
<P>The rest of the HOWTO deals with setting up the jail and other things like
that, which shouldn't need to be altered between versions of BIND.  You can
just dump the new binaries in over top of the old ones, and you're good to go.
But don't forget to kill and restart BIND afterwards, or the old, vulnerable
version will still be running!
<P>
