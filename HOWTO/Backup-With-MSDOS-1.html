<P>Earlier I posed the question on the Net, how does one back up a Linux
machine to a Colorado Jumbo 250 tape drive on an MS-DOS machine.
From the email I received,
it seems that this is a frequently pondered problem.
Now that I've figured it out, I'm posting the method.
If anybody wants to massage this into a HOWTO document, let me know.
I should thank Jim Nance
(
<A HREF="mailto:jlnance@isscad.com">jlnance@isscad.com</A>)
for pointing out that an MS-DOS machine need not always be an MS-DOS machine.
This technique should also work for any other tape drive
supported by the ftape module, and for SCSI tape drives with suitable
obvious changes (i.e. substituting /dev/st0 for /dev/ftape).
<P>The criteria I set were that the resulting setup should be as secure
as possible and should be fairly simple, and take up little or no space
on the MS-DOS machine's hard drive. It should also be capable of
recovering from the worst system corruptions, up to and including the
theft of the hard disk, requiring a restore to a bare Linux file system.
The technique described here uses no hard drive space on the MS-DOS
machine, though it requires that that machine be assigned an IP#.
You will need three formatted, blank 1.44MB diskettes.
