<P>NOTE: I have no idea if the IDE drive works the same way as the printer port
version does since I don't have one, so please don't ask me.
<P>
<P>The Debian install portion was basically just
copied with little or no editing by this author.  As such, there may
be some duplication of instructions.
<P>This document assumes the following:
<UL>
<LI> You have a printer port ZIP drive (since the ZIP Plus has 
both, I assume that it will work as well.)</LI>
<LI> You already have Linux installed and running; this document is
not for a first time install of Linux.</LI>
<LI> You have ppa support in your current kernel or if module, the
ppa module has been loaded.</LI>
<LI> The mount point for the ZIP disk is the /iomega directory.</LI>
</UL>
