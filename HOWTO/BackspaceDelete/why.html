><P
>I hope the basic problem is clear at this point: there is a
	 bottleneck between the keyboard and console applications, that is, the fact
	 that they can only communicate by <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ASCII</SPAN
> sequences. So
	 special keys must be first translated from keysyms to sequences, and then
	 from sequences to key capabilities. Since different consoles have different
	 ideas about what this translation can look like, we need a terminal
	 database. The system would work flawlessly, except for a small problem: it
	 is not always set up correctly, and not everyone uses it.
	 </P
><P
>Applications must have a way to know which database entry to use:
    this is accomplished by suitably setting the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>TERM</TT
>
    environment variable. In some cases, there is a mismatch between the
    terminal emulator and the content of the database entry suggested by
    <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>TERM</TT
>.</P
><P
>Moreover, many applications <EM
>do not use</EM
> the
	 terminal database (or at least not all of it), and consider
	 <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>BS</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>DEL</SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ASCII</SPAN
> codes
	 with an intended meaning: thus, without looking at the database, they
	 assign them semantics (usually, of course, the semantics is removing the
	 character before or under the cursor). So now our beautiful scheme is
	 completely broken (as every Linux user is bitterly aware). For instance,
	 the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>bash</SPAN
> assumes that <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>DEL</SPAN
>
	 should do a <SPAN
CLASS="ACTION"
>backward-delete-char</SPAN
>, that is,
	 backspace. Hence, on a fresh install the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
>
	 key works on the console as expected, but just because of two twists in a
	 row! Of course, the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Delete</B
> key does not work. This happens
	 because the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>bash</SPAN
> does not look into the terminal
	 database for the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kdch1</TT
> capability.</P
><P
>Just to illustrate how things have become entangled, consider the
	 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fix_bs_and_del</B
> script provided with the Red Hat
	 distribution (and maybe others). It assigns on-the-fly the
	 <SPAN
CLASS="KEYSYM"
>BackSpace</SPAN
> keysym to the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> key,
	 and the <SPAN
CLASS="KEYSYM"
>Delete</SPAN
> keysym to the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Delete</B
>
	 key. Now the shell works! Unfortunately, all programs relying on the
	 correct coupling of keysym generation and terminal database mappings are
	 now not working at all, as the <SPAN
CLASS="KEYSYM"
>Delete</SPAN
> keysym is mapped to
	 <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>DEL</SPAN
>, and the latter to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kbs</TT
> key
	 capability by the terminfo database, so in such programs both keys produce
	 backspacing.</P
