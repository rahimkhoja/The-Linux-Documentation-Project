>With the release of PA-RISC architecture in Debian 3.0
			(aka <EM
>Woody</EM
>), a major improvement was
			made in term of quantity and quality of hardware support.
			Since 0.9.3 released<A
NAME="AEN123"
HREF="#FTN.AEN123"

CLASS="footnote"
>[1]</SPAN
></A
>, the kernel has been
			greatly improved, so that much unsupported hardware by the time 0.9.3 went out
			is now handled. That's why even if your model is not listed here, you might
			give it a try and report your result to the mailing list:

>Mind that as of this document's publication date, the 2.4 series of the
			Linux kernel are deemed obsolete, and no development happens in that branch.
			Any new comer to the PA-RISC/Linux port should look at the 2.6 kernel series,
			which supports much more hardware than the 2.4 does. Accordingly, one will not try
			to use the now aging <EM
>Woody</EM
> release and will instead focus
			on its successor: <EM
>Sarge</EM
>, or even better, the upcoming 
			<EM
>Etch</EM
