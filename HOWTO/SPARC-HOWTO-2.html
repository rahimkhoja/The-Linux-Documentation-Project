<H2><A NAME="s2">2. SPARC, which one ?</A></H2>

<P>This document deals only with SPARC based 
computers, in order to check, just
type <CODE>uname -m</CODE> command and you should read
something like <CODE>sparc4x</CODE> where x is blank,c,d,m,u
if the system runs Solaris, or <CODE>sparc</CODE> for 32 bits SPARC architectures
and <CODE>sparc64</CODE> for 64 bits SPARC architectures if it runs Linux.
2.x.y
<P>
<P>
<P>SPARC stands for Scalable Processor ARChitecture,
it derives from research done between 1984-1988 
on the  RISC architecture at UC Berkeley.
It exists 3 versions of this archiecture, SPARC-V7, SPARC-V8 
(32 bits) and SPARC-V9 (64 bits).
As you  are likely to encounter a lot of implementations of
the SPARC architecture, in the next section,  the main features
of theses processors are summarized.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Sun SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This is quite obsolete, it is an implementation of the 
SPARC-V7 ; its main feature are an Integer unit (IU), an external Floating Point Unit (FPU),
an unified data + instruction 64KB direct associative cache, and an Memory Managment Unit (MMU).
There is a 4 stage pipeline for the integer instructions 
(fetch F, decode D, exec E, update WB)
FPU and IU are synchronized.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Super SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This is Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it is usualy found at around 50Mhz clok rates
featuring up to 1MB of L2 cache, it is available both as single and dual processor modules 
(SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20). The higher clock frequency I
have encountered so far is 60Mhz.
<P>On a technical point of view this is a SPARC-V8 implementation,
it is a superscalar processor,
having 2 caches, one for instruction the other one for data. 
<UL>
<LI>The 20kB instruction cache is a 5 way associative.</LI>
<LI>The 16KB data cache is 4 way associative. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Micro SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This is once again Texas Instrument and Sun's brainchild, it can be found
in the SparcStation Classic, SparcStation LX, at frequency up to
50Mhz. Its derivative, the Micro SPARC II can be found in the SparcStation
4 and SparcStation 5 at frequencies up to 110Mhz.
<P>On a technical point of view, its main features are a high level of
integration, having 2 caches, one for instructions, the other one for
data.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A 4KB instruction direct associative cache.</LI>
<LI>A 2KB data direct associative cache.</LI>
</UL>
 
<P>It is not possible to add an L2 cache.
If you wish to learn more about the MicroSPARC processor you can browse
Sun's 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/processors/index.html"> Ultra SPARC</A> ressources. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Hyper SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>This processor was introduced by ROSS in 1993, it is usualy found in the 
SparcStation 10, and SparcStation 20, at frequencies up to 150Mhz 
(I have heard of 200Mhz dual processor modules, but Have not
witnessed one yet). It can be found on single or dual
processor modules.
<P> 
On a technical point of view it is an implementation of the SPARC-V8,
it is superscalar. It can be found with L2 cache up to 512KB
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 ERC32</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a radhard SPARC V7 microprocessor designed to be used on the
space segment.
<P>It comes as a single unit or as a three chip 
package. Main manufacturer is  <CODE>ATMEL</CODE> in Nantes,
France. At least, one software vendor claims to have GNU/Linux running
on this CPU, this is for the 
<P>

has not been updated since March 2001. As I have not had the
opportunity to check this claim. I am more than doubtful.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 LEON</A>
</H2>

<P>This is also a radhard implementation of the SPARC V8 designed to be
used on the space segment. It is the ESA's brainchild and the lead
designer is jiri gaisler. 
More information can be found on LEON's website:
<A HREF="http://www.gaisler.com/leonmain.html">http://www.gaisler.com/leonmain.html</A><P>The 2.4 and 2.5 kernel series are not yet supported, however the 2.0 kernel
series is supported by the <CODE>uClinux</CODE> MMU less
GNU/Linux distribution. 
This distribution has been built at ESA/ESTEC December 26 2003
on a SuSE 8.0 GNU/Linux distribution
with gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 and a 2.4.18 kernel.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Ultra SPARC</A>
</H2>

<P>The Ultra SPARC processor is an extension of the SPARC-V9
architecture, it is a 64 bits processor, it features some video
processing instructions. It is found in all the computer whose name
start with Ultra.
<P>The Ultra SPARC II is an improvement of the Ultra SPARC, the 
Ultra SPARCIII is actually the second generation of Ultra SPARC
processors, it was first introduced in the SunBlade 1000 Workstation.
If wish to learn more about the UltraSPARC processors you can browse
Sun's 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/processors/index.html"> Ultra SPARC</A> ressources. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 SPARC64 V</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This processor is based on the SPARC V9 and is made by Fujitsu
It is a 64bits CPU with some very interesting error handling features such as
ECC memory for
the L1 cache, hardware instruction retry, error classification.
<P>There is a 64 bit virtual address space and 43 bit physical address space. 
It is used in the PRIMEPOWER high end servers to mainframe class of Fujitsu's 
offering.
<P>The cache is organized as :
<UL>
<LI>A 128kB 2 way associative L1 instruction cache</LI>
<LI>A 128kB 2 way associative L1 data cache</LI>
<LI>A 2MB unified 4 way associative L2 cache</LI>
</UL>
<P>More information can be found on the

whitepaper.
<P>You may read the
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/CPU-Design-HOWTO.html">CPU-Design-HOWTO</A>, this HOWTO has a lot of interesting links
when it comes to studying the CPUs.
<P>To summarize, the 32 bits workstations are the:
<UL>
<LI>The sun4 workstation is the 
sun4/330 model.</LI>
<LI>The sun4c workstations are the
SparcStation 1,2, IPC and IPX models.</LI>
<LI>The sun4m workstations are the 
SparcStation 5, 10 and 20. </LI>
</UL>

Only the SparcStation 10 and SparcStation 20 are SMP
capable: up to 2 CPU modules.
<P>For more information on the SparcStation 5, 10, 20
you can read Sun's
<A HREF="http://docs.sun.com/"> documentation </A>online or download it available.
<P>The following model have an 64 bits UltraSPARC
architecture (sun4u).
SunUltra 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000, 1500, 2000.
The SunUltra 2, 60, 80 and SunBlade 1000 are SMP capable, 
with the Ultra 80 and SunBlade 1000 and 2000 accepting up to 4 CPU modules, 
the SunUltra 2 and 60 accepting only 2 CPU modules.
<P>The SunBlade 2000 is the latest one featuring Sun's latest marvel
the Ultra III CPU, at a premium price of course.
You can have a summary of the UltraWorkstation still in production
at 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/desktop/products/">Sun's</A> website.
<P>A lot of information has been compiled in 
the 
<A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/local/datorhandbok/SunHardwareFAQ.html">Sun hardware reference</A> that is found on many sites,  
or on 
<A HREF="http://www.sunhelp.org/info-ref.php">SunHelp</A> 's  website.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.9">2.9 Deciphering the CPUs</A>
</H2>

<P>At first, a reference like SM61 or RT-200-D-125/512 seems 
to be, to say the least, quite cryptic.
Actually, understanding theses references is really easy.
<P>
<H3>Ross Technology.</H3>

<P>Theses CPUs's naming scheme is <CODE>RT-a00-b-freq/cache</CODE>
where 
<UL>
<LI><CODE>a</CODE> is a digit:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>1</CODE> SparcStation 10.</LI>
<LI><CODE>2</CODE> SparcStation 20.</LI>
<LI><CODE>6</CODE> SPARC MP600 ( not exactly a workstation ).</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>b</CODE> is a letter:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>D</CODE> Dual CPU.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Q</CODE> Quad CPU.</LI>
<LI><CODE>S</CODE> Single CPU.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>freq</CODE> The frequency expressed in Megahertz.</LI>
<LI><CODE>cache</CODE> The amount of cache memory expressed in Kilobytes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When these modules are in a workstation the naming convention is 
HSxy, for example <CODE>ywing</CODE> is a SparcStation 20 HS22,
thus it is easier to have a look inside the workstation.
<H3>SM modules.</H3>
