>X Window System</A
> is the display and networking protocol 
     developed by MIT.  The X is built with network in mind with the capability to run a (graphical) session on a remote computer.
     In it, an X Display Manager is used to start a session from a local system or from another computer.  The request and the start 
     of the session is handled by the XDMCP, which stands for "X Display Manager Control Protocol" and is a network protocol. 
     It provides a way of running the X-Terminal to run on your PC (or MAC) and it uses the X Server to provide a client/server 
     interface between display hardware (the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop environment while also providing 
     both the windowing infrastructure and a standardized application interface (quoted from XFree86 Project home page).  
     The X-Terminal can be displayed with an individual window or multiple windows, based on your X window system's software capabilities and setup.

>     I am always looking for the best way to use Linux, both at home and in work.  One of the biggest advantages among all is the ability to re-use the 
     older systems (like Pentium, Pentium II, Pentium III and even the 486 and AMD x86 CPUs) as a Xterminal (by using the Win32 apps; 
     like Hummingbird's Exceed, Reflection X, X-Win32 or X-ThinPro.  For MAC, try eXodus) to run 
     from any of your PC remotely. 
     I found out, somehow very surprising, that there are many documents on the INTERNET that can help you to set it up, 
     but not with a step by step HOW-TO format!  
     This is how I came up with this document as a way to share my experiences with all users.  By using X and XDMCP, 
     you can build a good, reliable and low cost X- environment for your home or work IT solution.  Best of all, it is free!
     You will also find out that those long abandoned PC by the current Windows system can run the X in Linux just fine!  
     It can save you money and spare the mother earth!

>     In recent years, new Linux distributions are getting easier to use by adding new user UI.  However, I still believe much in manual
     control of the system and application if I can, because in this way, I know what I am going to change in my system in the way
     I wanted it.  Therefore, I will focus this document on manual configuration.
