principles

<!--
sgml
-->

The principle of any sgml'ed document (linuxdoc, docbook, html) is
more or less the same:
<P>Don't write how it should <EM>look like</EM>, but write what it <EM>is</EM>.
<P>This is a different approach than the standard
&quot;wysiwyg&quot;
<BLOCKQUOTE>What you see is what you (should) get
(if you are a very lucky one and your computer wins the war against
buggy software)</BLOCKQUOTE>
 one
<BLOCKQUOTE>You might want to call it
<CODE>wysiwym</CODE>, i.e. &quot;What you see is what you mean&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
.
You do not tell the program that this line should be in a bigger font,
<B>to look like</B> a headline.
What you do is telling that this line <B>is</B> a headline.
You do not try to make your document <B>look like</B> a
report, but you tag it <B>to be</B> a report.
So you <EM>tag</EM> the text with the appropriate &lt;tag&gt;.
<P>
<P>The big advantages of this approache are:
<OL>
<LI>You do not need to mess around with fontsetting, line gaps or
anything directly connected to the layout.</LI>

<!--
portability
-->

You describe your document in a more abstract way so it's more
reusable and can be mapped to different media types.
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you ever tried the reuse a document written in a
specialized wysiwy layout for html then you know what I'm
talking about.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition in all sgml-style documents you will find named symbols
This is a concept to expand the charset of the document and to avoid
inconsitences in decision of the parser, how to interpret or map some
special characters.
<P>How should the parser know weather a <CODE>&lt;</CODE> character is
starting a tag or should be printed directly.
This is solved by the named character <EM>lt</EM>.
If you write <CODE>&amp;lt;</CODE> this one will result to <CODE>&lt;</CODE> in your
text.
For a list of the named symbols see

<DT><B>Hint for the new user</B><DD><P>It might be a good idea, to download this document not only as a dvi or
ps document, but also to download the sgml source.
This offers you the chance to look into the sources, if you find something
within this article, wich might fit your needs.
