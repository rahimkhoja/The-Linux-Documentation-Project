<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Configuring a kernel for the ZIP drive</A></H2>

<P>To use the ZIP drive with Linux, you must have a kernel configured
with support for the SCSI system, support for SCSI disks, and support
for the host adapter you are using.  If you are not familiar with
building a kernel, you should read up on the 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Linux Kernel HOWTO</A> for information.
<P>You must begin the process of building a kernel with the configuration
step.  Here, you identify the specific kernel components that you
need. First step <CODE> cd /usr/src/linux</CODE>. There are several
ways to actually do the configuration. Under X windows I use 
<B>make xconfig</B>. There is also <CODE>make menuconfig</CODE>
or <CODE>make config</CODE> for command line prompts. The easiest way 
is with xconfig. 
<P>In the section <B>SCSI Support</B> set <B>SCSI support = Y</B>.
Also set <B>SCSI disk support = Y</B>.
<P>In the section <B>SCSI low-level drivers</B> you want to set 
<B>IOMEGA Parallel Port ZIP drive SCSI support = M</B>. The M
stands for modules. 
<P>In the section <B>Character Devices</B> find and set 
<B>Parallell Printer support = M</B>
<P>If you are a bit unsure about any of this, use zdisk for the make
step. This will build and install the kernel to floppy. If you 
screw it up somehow, you still have a good bootable system on the hard
drive. 
<P>Now build the kernel with these steps:
<UL>
<LI> make dep</LI>
<LI> make clean</LI>
<LI> make zImage or zlilo or zdisk </LI>
<LI> make modules</LI>
<LI> make mdoules_install</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>hint</B> if you want to create an output log of the make zImage
step you can use
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   make zImage 2>&amp;1 | tee zImage.out
   
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This is really
a good thing to do, if you have compile errors or other conflicts
in the configuration, now you have a file with the error messages or
compile errors. This makes asking for help much easier.
<P>You also need to load the modules somewhere. On my system I just added
a couple of lines to the boot.local file.
<UL>
<LI> insmod ppa</LI>
<LI> insmod lp</LI>
</UL>

My system is Suse 5.3 and this file is in /etc/rc.d. The location of this
file will vary by distribution, but there will be a file somewhere, for
local changes to be made at start up time. You should use the file that
is applicable for your distribution. 
<P>Now <CODE>shutdown and reboot</CODE>. 
<P>You can also build all or part of the SCSI system as modules.  If you
do this, be sure to load scsi.o, then sd.o and finally the driver for
your host adapter, before you try to access the ZIP drive.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 SCSI version</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you already have a SCSI disk in your system, and you are connecting
the ZIP drive to the same controller, there is no additional kernel
configuration required.  Otherwise, you will most likely have to build
a new kernel.
<P>If you are building a kernel to support the SCSI version of the ZIP
drive, you should select SCSI support and SCSI disk support.  You must
also select a driver for the interface card you will use. If you have
a ZIP Zoom, select the aha152x driver.
<P>Be sure to read the documentation for your adapter in the SCSI HOWTO
and any README files in the drivers/scsi subdirectory of the Linux
source tree.  Pay attention to command line parameters that you might
have to use to help the kernel initialise your adapter.
<P>For instance, if you are using the ZIP Zoom card, you will have to add
something like
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          aha152x=0x340,11,7,1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to the boot command (or include it in your /etc/lilo.conf file in an
append clause).  This tells the driver the port address and IRQ of
your ZIP Zoom card - be sure to use the numbers that correspond to the
way your jumpers are set.
<P>You should also read Paul Gortmaker's
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html">BOOTPROMPT HOWTO</A> for information
about configuring your kernel with LILO or LOADLIN.
