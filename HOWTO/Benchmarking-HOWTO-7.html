<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 How this document was produced</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The first step was reading section 4 "Writing and submitting a HOWTO" of the HOWTO Index by Tim Bynum.
<P>I knew absolutely nothing about SGML or LaTeX, but was tempted to use an automated documentation generation package after reading the various comments about SGML-Tools. However, inserting tags manually in a document reminds me of the days I hand-assembled a 512 byte monitor program for a now defunct 8-bit microprocessor, so I got hold of the LyX sources, compiled it, and used its LinuxDoc mode. Highly recommended combination: <B>LyX and SGML-Tools</B>.

</H2>

<P>
<P>David Niemi, the author of the Unixbench suite, has proved to be an endless source of information and (valid) criticism.
<P>I also want to thank Greg Hankins one of the main contributors to the SGML-tools package, Linus Torvalds and the entire Linux community. This HOWTO is my way of giving back.

<P>
<P>Your mileage may, and will, vary. Be aware that benchmarking is a touchy subject and a great time-and-energy consuming activity.
