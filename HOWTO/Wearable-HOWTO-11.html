<P>
<H3>Commercial Solutions.</H3>

<P>Some manufacturers ( eg Seiko, Citizen, Casio ) manufactured
Wristwatches that could be linked to a computer, ( I remember that in
1982 Seiko showed a prototype of a wirstwatch TV ( monochrome LCD )).
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.casio.com">Casio </A> has a broad set of wristwatches, some of
them could be descibed as Wearables that can display time among other
things, of interest are the
<UL>
<LI>The PC Unite that can exchange data with a computer using
an infra red link.</LI>
<LI>The ATC1200-1V Forester features an electronic compass.
plus thermometer and barometer. I used to own one of these it is a
great piece of hardware</LI>
<LI>The Technowear products have different features including voice
recording, IR remote control, Databank...</LI>
<LI>The 
<A HREF="http://205.158.10.200/gps/top.html">GPS </A>watch is one of the most intruiging watch I have
ever seen</LI>

<P>
<H3>The Wristwatchcomputer.</H3>

<P>In 1998 S. Mann displayed a 
<A HREF="http://www.wearcam.org/wristwatchcomputer/">Wristwatch </A>videoconferencing computer, it runs
GNU/Linux and uses an XF86 Server, there is a pinhole video camera on
the watch itself. This device is to say the least impressive, some of
the software, is 
<A HREF="http://www.wearcam.org/orbits/orbits_v1.08.tar.gz">downlable </A> and GPLed.
<P>
<P>It is also possible to use a 4 lines LCD display connected to the
serial port of your laptop ( numerous paper or online electronics
magazine offer schematics ).
<P>
<H3>PDA type          </H3>

<P>PDA's seem to be a cheap and efficient way of sending and displaying
data for a wearable, actually any PDA with a VT100 emulation program
and a serial link can be used effectively as a terminal ( I have
successfully used my HP200LX running 
<A HREF="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit">kermit </A> 
<P>as a terminal for my desktop,
giving me an emergency access to it if the display failed )

<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Head UP displays</A>
        </H2>

<P>The distinction between obstrusives an non obstrusives ones is not
from the wearer point of view but from the other people, that is is
the display forbid to see the wearer's eyes
<H3>Obstrusives displays          </H3>

<P>
<H3>Hacks with LEDs            </H3>

<P>Some people managed to use blinking LEDs in order to retrieve
information from their device. This is one of the simplest display
one can imagine : a LED or a row of LED blinking.
<P>
<H3>Sony GLASSTRON            </H3>

<P>Sony sells a device called the Glasstron; in Paris, France the FNAC
Montparnasse sells the PVD-V30
glasstron 55 at 13999F ( this is about US $2333 ).
<P>
<H3>The M1</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.tekgear.ca/displays/m1.html">Tekgear</A> manufactures the M1.
<P>
<H3>The VRD ( Virtual Retinal Display )            </H3>

<P>With this device a manufactured by 
<A HREF="http://www.mvis.com">Microvison</A>
a  LASER LED draws the image on the wearer's retina,
the US Navy tested it in the summer 1999, at Hawaii ( see in the army
now ).
<H3>Nonobstrusives displays          </H3>

<P>The 
<A HREF="http://www.microopticalcorp.com">Microptical </A>corporation manufactures two
displays the Integrated Eyeglass display and the ClipOn display.
