<P>E-Mail delivery can be invoked by issuing the command &quot;sendmail -q&quot;.
For those who are interested in what sendmail actually does,
&quot;sendmail -q -v&quot; will give a more verbose version of the delivery
process.
<P>It is very convenient to automate the process of e-mail delivery. A
tool commonly used for this process is cron.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 How to have e-mail delivered at special times.</A>
</H2>

<P>Edit your crontab:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
crontab -e
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Add lines of the form:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
05 18-23,0-7    * * Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri /usr/sbin/sendmail -q
05 *            * * Sat,Sun             /usr/sbin/sendmail -q
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Please refer to the crontab man page (available through &quot;man 5 \
crontab&quot;) for further information. I think the format is pretty
obvious. The example crontab entries shown above send e-mail (if,
and only if, e-mail is available from the queue) 5 minutes after an
hour on weekdays, starting at 6:05 pm, and stopping at 7:05 am.  On
weekends, e-mail is delivered 5 minutes after an hour, starting at
12:05 pm on Saturday, and stopping 11:05 pm on Sunday.
<P>As a dial-on-demand user, it is sometimes desirable to have your
system collect your e-mail via the POP3 protocol at certain times of
the day. You could therefore add an entry similar to the following
to your crontab:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
0 21            * * * popclient -3 -u &lt;your pop3 user name
goes here&gt; -p &lt;put your password here&gt; -o /var/spool/mail/&lt;the user
on your system that should receive the collected e-mail&gt;
&lt;mailhost.somedomain.com&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of course, this should all go on a single line.
<P>Then, save the file and leave the editor. The crontab should now be
installed.
