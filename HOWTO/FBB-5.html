<P><EM>Notice: You see, folks, that I keep trying to get
as many as possible versions of this great
software (Jean-Paul, F6FBB, must be very proud after
reading these words now). What I think when mention
"as many as possible versions" means that we have
learned how to get both WinFBB and X11 LinFBB on
the same computer. But, that's not all. There is a
variety of daemon versions of LinFBB. In this section
we are going to discuss how to *add* a daemon LinFBB
to the existing two: X11 LinFBB and WinFBB!</EM></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Well, many amateurs have suggested me to install
a couple of packages that weren't look to me as
really requested for LinFBB daemon to work.
Anyway, I installed those packages <EM>before</EM>
the installation of LinFBB itself:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      libax25.rpm
      ax25apps.rpm
      ax25tool.rpm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


</LI>
<LI>Now it is the right time to install <CODE>fbbsrv.rpm</CODE>
package. The archive was composed to make its
own directories, as "base" directories. The last new
version to start with, that I have managed to find as
a <CODE>.rpm</CODE> package, was 7.01f Release 4 (09 December
1999).


</LI>
<LI>A file called <B>fbb.conf</B>, serving as the
replacement for <B>init.srv</B>, is placed in the
location: <B>/etc/ax25/fbb.conf</B>


</LI>
<LI><EM>Unless</EM> you are going to install daemon-<EM>only</EM>
system, you should make a backup of the
following existing files:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      dirmes.sys
      etat.sys
      heard.bin
      inf.sys
      statis.dat
      tpstat.sys
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


</LI>
<LI>Now you have to edit <B>/etc/ax25/fbb.conf</B>
and change some paths in case you already
have X11 LinFBB installed on a <EM>different</EM>
path. Here you have some examples that cover
my particular situation...


</LI>
<LI>Directory of data files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb,
should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/system</B>


</LI>
<LI>Directory of config files, instead of /etc/ax25/fbb,
should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/system</B>


</LI>
<LI>Directory of message files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb/mail,
should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/mail</B>


</LI>
<LI>Directory of compressed files, instead of /var/ax25/fbb/binmail,
should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/binmail</B>


</LI>
<LI>Directory of users, instead of .../home/fbbdos/...,
should be ...<B>/mnt/win/fbb/users</B>... (case you
don't mind that both your WinFBB and LinFBB users handle
the same location for users' files)


</LI>
<LI>Directory of YAPP files, instead of /home/fbbdos/yapp,
should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/users/yapp</B> (the same
reason as above)


</LI>
<LI>Directory of documentation files, instead of
/var/ax25/fbb/docs, should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/docs</B>


</LI>
<LI>Directory of pg programs, instead of /usr/local/pg,
should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/pg</B>


</LI>
<LI>Path and filename for import file, instead of
C:\FBB\MAIL.IN should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb/mail.in</B>


</LI>
<LI>Now you have to edit <B>/usr/sbin/xfbb.sh</B>
and change some paths in case you already
have running X11 version of LinFBB on a <EM>different</EM>
path. Here you have an example that cover
my particular situation...


</LI>
<LI>Base directory of XFBB software, instead of
/var/ax25/fbb, should be <B>/mnt/win/fbb</B>


</LI>
<LI>So far - so good. Now it is the time to start
LinFBB daemon. The command for that is in the
location: <B>/usr/sbin/xfbb.sh</B> and it may
be executed within an <EM>xterm</EM>. If
everything is OK, you should get several
system messages on your screen, ending with
something like:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      xfbbC/X server running ...
      xfbbd ready and running ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


</LI>
<LI>Well, daemon itself can't be used to access the
BBS so it is needed to activate a <EM>client</EM>
that is <B>/usr/sbin/xfbbC</B>. It has a couple
of parameters (a callsign/password pairs that are
stored in <B>/fbb/passwd.sys</B>). Note that xfbbC can
also be activated within another <EM>xterm</EM>.


</LI>
<LI>If you are like me, you would like to activate one
more <EM>xterm</EM> with xfbbC in a way to monitor
your radio frequency. If you have enough room on
your screen, you may place all three <EM>xterm</EM>
windows side by side.


</LI>
<LI>When you finish your xfbbC console session, it is suitable
to use the same <EM>xterm</EM> to eventually stop the
daemon. First of all, with the command <B>ps ax</B>
you should locate PIDs of xfbb.sh shell and daemon itself,
that you may <B>kill</B> after that.</LI>
