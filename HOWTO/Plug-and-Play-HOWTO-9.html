<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc9.1">Unexpected Interrupt </A>
</H2>

<P> This means that an interrupt happened that no driver expected.
It's unlikely that the hardware issued an interrupt by mistake.  It's
more likely that the software has a minor bug and doesn't realize that
some software did something to cause the interrupt.  In many cases you
can safely ignore this error message, especially if it only happens
once or twice at boot-time.  For boot-time messages, look at the
messages which are nearby for a clue as to what is going on.  For
example, if probing is going on, perhaps a probe for a physical device
caused that device to issue an interrupt that the driver didn't
expect.  Perhaps the driver wasn't listening for the correct IRQ
number.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc9.2">Plug and Play Configuration Error (Dell BIOS) </A>
</H2>

<P>The BIOS was unable to configure bus-resource.  There may be an
interrupt conflict which can't be avoided.  Dell suggests that you
remove some of your non-essential cards and see if it goes away.  In
one case this problem was due to a defective motherboard.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc9.3">isapnp: Write Data Register 0xa79 already used (from logs)</A>
</H2>

<P>If you use isa-pnp, the IO address 0xa79 must not ever be used by
any device.  So if other hardware is using 0xa79 when you try to load
the isa-pnp module, you'll get this message in your logs and the
isa-pnp will exit.  One way to try to fix this is to load the isa-pnp
module early before other hardware is initialized.  For PCMCIA this
means to load isa-pnp before running cb modules and service.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc9.4">Can't allocate region (PCI)</A>
</H2>

<P>Here "region" means address range.  A PCI device that needs two
addresses will have region 0 for the first address and region 1 for the
second address needed.  Use the command: lspci -vv to see the various
resource regions (often just called regions) and whether the address
is of type IO or memory.  In PCI jargon region 2 is "base address 2"
(or "base address register 2"), etc.  </P>
