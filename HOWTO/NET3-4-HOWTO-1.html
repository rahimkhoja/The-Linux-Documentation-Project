<P>This is the first release since LinuxPorts has become the author of
this document. First let me say that we hope that over the next few months
you will find this document to be of use and that we are able to provide
accurate and timely information in regards to networking issues with Linux.
<P>This document like the other howto's that we manage is going to become very
different, this document will shortly become the Networking-HOWTO not just
the Net-3(4) Howto. We will cover such items as PPP, VPN, and others...
