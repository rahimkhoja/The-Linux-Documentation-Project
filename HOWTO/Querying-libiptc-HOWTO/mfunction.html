>The tables that you change are not written back until the

is possible for two library users operating on the same chain to race 
each other; locking would be required to prevent this, and it is not 
currently done. There is no race with counters, however; counters are 
added back in to the kernel in such a way that counter increments 
between the reading and writing of the table still show up in the new 
table. <EM

your changes</EM
