><P
>&#13;	    To gain any benefit from this method, the signed envelope
	    sender address that you generate should be useless in the
	    hands of spammers.  Typically, this would imply that the
	    signature incorporates a time stamp that would eventually
	    expire:

	  </P

>&#13;	    With this in mind, you could generate a <A
HREF="gloss.html#envfrom"

	    Although this address does not expire, if you start seeing
	    junk mail to it, you will at least know the source of the
	    leak - it is incorported in the recipient address.
	    Moreover, you can easily block specific recipient address
	    signatures, without affecting normal mail delivery to that
	    same recipient.

>&#13;	    Two more issues occur with mailing list servers.  Usually,
	    replies to request mails (such as
	    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"subscribe"</SPAN
>/<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"unsubscribe"</SPAN
>) are
	    sent with no envelope sender.

><P
>&#13;		The first issue pertains to servers that send
		responses back to the <A
HREF="gloss.html#envfrom"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Envelope Sender</I
></A
>
		address of the request mail (as in the case of
		<TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:discuss@en.tldp.org"
>discuss@en.tldp.org</A
>&#62;</TT
>).  The problem is
		that commands for the mailing list server (such as
		<B
CLASS="command"
>subscribe</B
> or
		<B
CLASS="command"
>unsubscribe</B
>) are typically sent to
		one or more different addresses
		(e.g. <TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org"
>discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org</A
>&#62;</TT
> and
		<TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org"
>discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org</A
>&#62;</TT
>,
		respectively) than the address used for list mail.
		Hence, the subscriber address will be different from
		the sender address in messages sent to the list itself
		-- and in this example, also different from the
		address that will be generated for unsubscription
		requests.  As a result, you may not be able to post to
		the list, or unsubscribe.
	      </P
><P
>&#13;		The compromise would be to incorporate only the
		recipient <EM

> in the sender
		signature.  The sender address might then look like:

>&#13;		The second issue pertains to those that send responses
		back to the reply address in the message header of the
		request mail (such as
		<TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:spam-l-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com"
>spam-l-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com</A
>&#62;</TT
>).
		Since this address is not signed, the response from
		the list server would be blocked by your server.
	      </P
><P
>&#13;		There is not much you can do about this, other than to
		<SPAN

>&#13;	At this point, this approach starts losing some of its edge.
	Moreover, even legitimate DSNs are rejected unless the
	original mail has been sent via your server.  Thus, you should
	only consider doing this if for those of your users that do
	not roam, or otherwise send their outgoing mail via servers
	outside your control.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	That said, in situations where none of the above concerns
	apply to you, this method gives you a good way to not only
	eliminate collateral spam, but also a way to educate the
	owners of the sites that (presumably unwittingly) generate it.
	Moreover, as a side benefit, sites that perform <A
HREF="smtpchecks.html#callback"
>Sender Callout Verification</A
> will only get a positive response from
	you if the original mail was, indeed, sent from your site.  In
	essence, you are reducing your exposure to sender address
	forgeries by spammers.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	You could perhaps allow your users to specify whether to sign
	outgoing mails, and if so, specify which hosts should be
	allowed to return mails to the unsigned version of their
	address.  For instance, if they have system accounts on your
	mail server, you could check for the existence and content,
	respectively, of a given file in their home directory.
