      SMTP transaction than others.  Some are simply better than
      others.  Nearly all have their proponents and opponents.

>&#13;      Needless to say, these controversies extend to the methods

	  Service Provider (ISP), not on the merits of their
	  particular message.
	</P

>&#13;	  Some point out that ratware traps like <A
HREF="smtpdelays.html"
>SMTP transaction delays</A

HREF="greylisting.html"
>Greylisting</A

	  easily overcome and will be less effective over time, while

      then talk a little about my own experiences using some of them.
    </P

>&#13;      That said, there are some filtering methods in use today that I
      deliberately omit from this document:
    </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  Challenge/response systems (like <A
HREF="http://tmda.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>TMDA</A
>).  These are not
	  suitable for SMTP time filtering, as they rely on first
	  accepting the mail, then returning a confirmation request to
	  the <A
HREF="gloss.html#envfrom"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Envelope Sender</I
></A
>.  This technique is therefore
	  outside the scope of this document.

><P
>&#13;	  <A
HREF="gloss.html#bayesian"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"

>.  These require training specific
	  to a particular user, and/or a particular language.  As
	  such, these too are not normally suitable for use during the
	  SMTP transaction (But see <A
HREF="usersettings.html"
>User Settings and Data</A

></LI

><P
>&#13;	  <A
HREF="gloss.html#micropay"

	  weeding out junk mail until all the world's legitimate mail
	  is sent with a virtual <EM
>postage stamp</EM
>.
	  (Though in the mean time, they can be used for the opposite
	  purpose - that is, to accept mail carrying the stamp that
	  would otherwise be rejected).
	</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;      Generally, I have attempted to offer techniques that are as
      precise as possible, and to go to great lengths to avoid <A
HREF="gloss.html#falsepos"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>False Positive</I
></A
>s.  People's e-mail is important to them,
      and they spend time and effort writing it.  In my view,
      willfully using techniques or tools that reject large amounts of
      legitimate mail is a show of disrespect, both to the people that
      are directly affected and to the Internet as a whole.

      This is especially true for SMTP-time system wide filtering,
      because end recipients usually have little or no control over
      the criteria being used to filter their mail.
