	let alone by experimenting with primitive filtering techniques
	such as DNS blacklists (SpamHaus, SPEWS, SORBS...), chances
	are that you have lost some valid mail.

><P
>&#13;	Spam, just like many other artifacts of greed, is a social
	disease.  Call it affluenza, or whatever you like; lower life
	forms seek to destroy a larger ecosystem, and if successful,
	will actually end up ruining their own habitat in the end.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Larger social issues and philosophy aside: You - the mail system
	administrator - face the very concrete and real life dilemma of
	finding a way to deal with all this junk.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	As it turns out, there are some limitations with the
	conventional way that mail is being processed and delegated by
	the various components of mail transport and delivery
	software.  In a traditional setup, one or more <A
HREF="gloss.html#mx"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Mail Exchanger</I
></A
>(s) accept most or all incoming mail deliveries
	to addresses within a domain.  Often, they then forward the
	mail to one or more internal machines for further processing,
	and/or delivery to the user's mailboxes.  If any of these
	servers discovers that it is unable to perform the requested
	delivery or function, it generates and returns a DSN back to
	the sender address in the original mail.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	As organizations started deploying spam and virus scanners,
	they often found that the path of least resistance was to work
	these into the message delivery path, as mail is transferred
	from the incoming <A
HREF="gloss.html#mx"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Mail Exchanger</I
></A
>(s) to internal delivery
	hosts and/or software.  For instance, a common way filter out
	spam is by <EM
>routing</EM
> the mail through
	SpamAssassin or other software before it is delivered to a
	user's mailbox, and/or rely on spam filtering capabilities in
	the user's <A
HREF="gloss.html#mua"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Mail User Agent</I
></A
>.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Options for dealing with mail that is classified as spam or
	virus at this point are limited:

>&#13;	    You can return a <A

> back to the sender.
	    The problem is that nearly all spam and e-mail borne
	    virii are delivered with faked sender addresses.  If you
	    return this mail, it will invariably go to innocent third
	    parties -- perhaps warning a grandmother in Sweden, who
	    uses Mac OS X and does not know much about computers, that
	    she is infected by the Blaster worm.  In other words, you
	    will be generating <A

><P
>&#13;	    You can drop the message into the bit bucket, without
	    sending any notification back to the sender.  This is an
	    even bigger problem in the case of <A
HREF="gloss.html#falsepos"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>False Positive</I
></A

	    the receiver will ever know what happened to the message
	    (or in the receiver's case, that it ever existed).
	  </P

><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Depending on how your users access their mail (for
	    instance, if they access it via the IMAP protocol or use a
	    web-based mail reader, but not if they retreive it over
	    POP-3), you may be able to file it into a separate junk
	    folder for them -- perhaps as an option in their account
	    settings.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    This may be the best of these three options.  Even so, the
	    messages may remain unseen for some time, or simply
	    overlooked as the receiver more-or-less periodically scans
	    through and deletes mail in their <SPAN

>&#13;	As you would have guessed by now, the <EM

	virus filtering during the SMTP dialogue from the remote host,
	as the mail is being received by the inbound mail exchanger
	for your domain.  This way, if the mail turns out to be
	undesirable, you can issue a SMTP <EM
