>&#13;	  A filter that assigns a probability of spam based on the
	  recurrence of words (or, more recently, word
	  constellations/phrases) between messages.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  You initially train the filter by feeding it known junk mail
	  (spam) and known legitimate mail (ham).  A bayesian score
	  is then be assigned to each word (or phrase) in each
	  message, indicating whether this particular word or phrase
	  occurs most commonly in ham or in spam.  The word, along
	  with its score, is stored in a <EM
>bayesian
	  index</EM
>.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Such filters may catch indicators that may be missed by
	  human programmers trying to manually create keyword-based
	  filters.  At the very least, they automate this task.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Bayesian word indexes are most certainly specific to the
	  language in which they received training.  Moreover, they are
	  specific to individual users.  Thus, they are perhaps more
	  suitable for individual content filters (e.g. in <A
HREF="gloss.html#mua"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Mail User Agent</I
></A
>s) than they are for system-wide, SMTP-time
	  filtering.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Moreover, spammers have developed techniques to defeat
	  simple bayesian filters, by including random dictionary
	  words and/or short stories in their messages.  This
	  decreases the spam probability assigned by a baynesian
	  filter, and in the long run, degrades the quality of the
	  bayesian index.
