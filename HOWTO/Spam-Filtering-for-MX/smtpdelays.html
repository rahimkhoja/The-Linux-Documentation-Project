>2.1. SMTP Transaction Delays</H1
><P
>&#13;      As it turns out, one of the more effective ways of stopping spam
      is by imposing transaction delays during an inbound SMTP
      dialogue.  This is a primitive form of
      <EM
>teergrubing</EM
>, see: <A
HREF="http://www.iks-jena.de/mitarb/lutz/usenet/teergrube.en.html"

>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Most spam and nearly all e-mail borne virii are delivered
      directly to your server by way of specialized SMTP client
      software, optimized for sending out large amounts of mail in a
      very short time.  Such clients are commonly known as
      <A
HREF="gloss.html#ratware"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Ratware</I
></A
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In order to accomplish this task, ratware authors commonly take
      a few shortcuts that, ahem, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"diverge"</SPAN
> a bit
      from the RFC 2821 specification.  One of the intrinsic traits of
      ratware is that it is notoriously impatient, especially with
      slow-responding mail servers.  They may issue the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>HELO</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>EHLO</B
> command
      before the server has presented the initial SMTP banner, and/or
      try to pipeline several SMTP commands before the server has
      advertised the <B
CLASS="command"
>PIPELINING</B
> capability.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Certain <A
HREF="gloss.html#mta"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Mail Transport Agent</I
></A
>s (such as Exim) automatically
      treat such SMTP protocol violations as
      <EM
>synchronization errors</EM
>, and immediately
      drop the incoming connection.  If you happen to be using such an
      MTA, you may already see a lot of entries to this effect in your
      log files.  In fact, chances are that if you perform any
      time-consuming checks (such as 
      <A
HREF="dnschecks.html"
>DNS checks</A
>) prior to presenting the initial
      SMTP banner, such errors will occur frequently, as ratware
      clients simply do not take the time to wait for your server to
      come alive (Things to do, people to spam).
    </P
><P
>&#13;      We can help along by imposing additional delays.  For instance,
      you may decide to wait:
    </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  20 seconds before presenting the initial SMTP banner,
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  20 seconds after the Hello (<B
CLASS="command"
>EHLO</B
> or
	  <B
CLASS="command"
>HELO</B
>) greeting,
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  20 seconds, after the <B
CLASS="command"
>MAIL FROM:</B
>
	  command, and
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  20 seconds after each <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT TO:</B
> command.
	</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;      Where did 20 seconds come from, you ask.  Why not a minute?  Or
      several minutes?  After all, RFC 2821 mandates that the sending
      host (client) should wait up to several minutes for every SMTP
      response.  The issue is that some receiving hosts, particularly
      those that use Exim, may perform <A
HREF="smtpchecks.html#callback"
>Sender Callout Verification</A
> in
      response to incoming mail delivery attempts.  If you or one of
      your users send mail to such a host, it will contact the <A
HREF="gloss.html#mx"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Mail Exchanger</I
></A
> (MX host) for your domain and start an SMTP
      dialogue in order to validate the sender address.  The default
      timeout of such <A
HREF="smtpchecks.html#callback"
>Sender Callout Verification</A
>s is 30 seconds - if
      you impose delays this long, the peer's sender callout
      verification would fail, and in turn the original mail delivery
      from you/your user might be rejected (usually with a temporary
      failure, which means the message delivery will be retried for 5
      days or so before the mail is finally returned to the sender).
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In other words, 20 seconds is about as long as you can stall
      before you start interfering with legitimate mail deliveries.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you do not like imposing such delays on every SMTP
      transaction (say, you have a very busy site and are low on
      machine resources), you may choose to use
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"selective"</SPAN
> transaction delays.  In this case, you
      could impose the delay:
    </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  If there is a problem with the peer's DNS information (see
	  <A
HREF="dnschecks.html"
>DNS checks</A
>).
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  After detecting some sign of trouble during the SMTP
	  transaction (see <A
HREF="smtpchecks.html"
>SMTP checks</A
>).
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  Only in the highest-numbered MX host in your DNS zone,
	  i.e. the mail exchanger with the last priority.  Often,
	  <A
HREF="gloss.html#ratware"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Ratware</I
></A
> specifically target these hosts,
	  whereas legitimate MTAs will try the lower-numbered MX hosts
	  first.
	</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;      In fact, selective transaction delays may be a good way to
      incorporate some less conclusive checks that we will discuss in
      the following sections.  You probably do not wish to reject the
      mail outright based the results from e.g. the SPEWS <A
HREF="dnschecks.html#dnsbl"
>blacklist</A
>, but on the other hand, it may
      provide a strong enough indication of trouble that you can at
      least impose transaction delays.  After all, legitimate mail
      deliveries are not affected, other than being subjected to a
      slight delay.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Conversely, if you find conclusive evidence of spamming (e.g. by
      way of certain <A
HREF="smtpchecks.html"
>SMTP checks</A
>), and your server
      can afford it, you may choose to impose an extended delay,
      e.g. 15 minutes or so, before finally rejecting the delivery
      <A
NAME="AEN632"
HREF="#FTN.AEN632"
><SPAN
CLASS="footnote"
>[1]</SPAN
></A
>.
      This is for little or no benefit other than slowing down the
      spammer a little bit in their quest to reach as many people as
      possible before DNS blacklists and other collaborative network
      checks catch up.  In other words, pure altruism on your
      side. :-)
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In my own case, selective transaction delays and the resulting
      SMTP synchronization errors account for nearly 50% of rejected
      incoming delivery attempts.  This roughly translates into saying
      that nearly 50% of incoming junk mail is stopped by SMTP
      transaction delays alone.
