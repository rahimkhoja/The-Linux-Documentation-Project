>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:marc (at) merlins.org"
>marc (at) merlins.org</A
>&#62;</TT
>),
          specifically for running SpamAssassin at SMTP time in Exim.
          This program operates through Exim's
          <TT
CLASS="option"
>local_scan()</TT
> interface, either patched
          directly into the Exim source code, or via Marc's own
          <TT

          <EM

          scan happens after the message data has been received,
          neither of these two features may be as useful as they
          would be earlier in the SMTP transaction.

        message through either SpamAssassin or Brightmail, and
        triggers if these indicate that the message is junk.  By
        default, it connects to a SpamAssassin daemon
        (<TT
CLASS="option"

        <TT

>&#13;        In our implementation, we are going to reject messages
        classified as spam.  However, we would like to keep a copy of
        such messages in a separate mail folder, at least for the time
        being.  This is so that the user can periodically scan for
        <A
HREF="gloss.html#falsepos"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>False Positive</I
></A
>s.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Exim offers <EM
>controls</EM
> that can be applied
        to a message that is accepted, such as
        <TT
CLASS="option"
>freeze</TT
>.  The Exiscan-ACL patch adds one more
        of these controls, namely <TT
CLASS="option"
>fakereject</TT
>.
        This causes the following SMTP response:

        <SPAN

        Finally, an <TT
CLASS="option"
>X-Spam-Status:</TT

        the message.  The idea is that the <A

        the recipient's <A

          Especially I find this to be the case since spammers have
          learned to defeat such systems by seeding random dictionary
          words or stories in their mail (e.g.  in the metadata of
