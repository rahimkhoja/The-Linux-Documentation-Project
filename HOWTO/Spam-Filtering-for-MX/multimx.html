      (a.k.a. <SPAN

      mind that in order to have any effect, any SMTP time filtering
      you incorporate on the primary MX has to be incorporated on all
      the others as well.  Otherwise, the sending host would simply
      sidestep filtering by retrying the mail delivery through your
      backup server(s).
    </P

>&#13;      If the backup server(s) are not under your control, ask
      yourself whether you need multiple MXs in the first place.  In
      this situation, chances are that they serve only as
      <EM
>redundant</EM
> mail servers, and that they in
      turn forward the mail to your primary MX.  If so, you probably
      don't need them.  If your host happens to be down for a little
      while, that's OK -- well-behaved sender hosts will retry
      deliveries for several days before giving up

    </P

>&#13;      A situation where you <EM
>may</EM
> need multiple
      MXs is to perform load balancing between several servers -
      i.e. if you receive so much mail that one machine alone could
      not handle it.  In this case, see if you could offload some
      tasks (such as <A
HREF="datachecks.html#virusscanners"
>virus</A
> and
      <A
HREF="datachecks.html#spamscanners"
>spam</A
> scanners) to other
      machines, in order to reduce or eliminate this need.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Again, if you do decide to keep using several MXs, your backup
      servers need to be (at least) as restrictive as the primary
      server, lest filtering in the primary MX is useless.
