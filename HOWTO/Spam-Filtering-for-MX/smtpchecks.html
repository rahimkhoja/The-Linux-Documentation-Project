>&#13;      Once the SMTP dialogue is underway, you can perform various
      checks on the commands and arguments presented by the remote
      host.  For instance, you will want to ensure that the name
      presented in the Hello greeting is valid.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      However, even if you decide to reject the delivery attempt early
      in the SMTP transaction, you may not want to perform the actual
      rejection right away.  Instead, you may stall the sender with
      SMTP transaction delays until after the <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT
      TO:</B
>, then reject the mail at that point.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The reason is that some ratware does not understand rejections
      early in the SMTP transaction; they keep trying.  On the other
      hand, most of them give up if the <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT TO:</B

      fails.

	  that IP addresses should always be enclosed in square
	  brackets when presented in lieu of a name.

	</P
><P
>&#13;	  In particular, you may wish to issue a strongly worded
	  rejection message to hosts that introduce themselves using
	  <EM
>your</EM
> IP address - or for that matter,
	  your host name.  They are plainly lying.  Perhaps you want
	  to stall the sender with an exceedingly long SMTP
	  transaction delay in response to such a greeting; say,
	  hours.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  For that matter, my own experience indicates that
	  <EM
>no</EM
> legitimate sites on the internet
	  present themselves to other internet sites using an IP
	  address literal (the [x.y.z.w] notation) either.  Nor should
	  they; all hosts sending mail directly on the internet should
	  use their valid <A
HREF="gloss.html#fqdn"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Fully Qualified Domain Name</I
></A
>.  The only use of use
	  of IP literals I have come across is from mail user agents
	  on my local area network, such as Ximian Evolution,
	  configured to use my server as outgoing SMTP server
	  (smarthost).  Indeed, I only accept literals from my own
	  LAN.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  You may or may not also wish to reject unqualified host
	  names (host names without a period).  I find that these are
	  rarely (but not never - how's that for double negative
	  negations) legitimate.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Similarly, you can reject host names that contain invalid
	  characters.  For internet domains, only alphanumeric letters
	  and hyphen are valid characters; a hyphen is not allowed as
	  the first character.  (You may also want to consider the
	  underscore a valid character, because it is quite common to
	  see this from misconfigured, but ultimately well-meaning,
	  Windows clients).
	</P
><P

	  command without first having received a Hello greeting,
	  well, polite people greet first.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  On my servers, I reject greetings that fail any of these
	  syntax checks.  However, the rejection does not actually
	  take place until after the <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT TO:</B
>
	  command.  In the mean time, I impose a 20 second transaction
	  delay after each SMTP command (<B
CLASS="command"

	  the provided name via DNS.  You can:
	</P
><P
></P

><P
>&#13;	  If either of these two checks succeeds, the name has been
	  verified.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Your MTA may have a built-in option to perform this check.
	  For instance, in Exim (see <A
HREF="exim.html"
>Appendix A</A
>),
	  you want to set "helo_try_verify_hosts = *", and create ACLs
	  that take action based on the "verify = helo" condition.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  This check is a little more expensive in terms of processing
	  time and network resources than the simple syntax checks.
	  Moreover, unlike the syntax checks, a mismatch does not
	  always indicate ratware; several large internet sites, such
	  as hotmail.com, yahoo.com, and amazon.com, frequently
	  present unverifiable Hello greetings.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  On my servers, I do a DNS validation of the Hello greeting
	  if I am not already stalling the sender with transaction
	  delays based on prior checks.  Then, if this check fails, I
	  impose a 20 second delay on every SMTP command from this
	  point forward.  I also prepare a
	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X-HELO-Warning:"</SPAN

	  to the message(s), and use to increase the <A

>&#13;	  You may find that this check alone may not be suitable as a
	  trigger to reject incoming mail.  Occasionally, legitimate
	  mail, such as a recurring billing statement, is sent out
	  from automated services with an invalid return address.
	  Also, an unfortunate side effect of spam is that some users

>2.3.3.3. Dictionary Attack Prevention</H3
><P
>&#13;	  <EM
>Dictionary Attack</EM
> is a term used to
	  describe SMTP transactions where the sending host keeps
	  issuing <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT TO:</B
> commands to probe for
	  possible recipient addresses based on common names (often
	  alphabetically starting with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"aaron"</SPAN
>, but
	  sometimes starting later in the alphabet, and/or at random).
	  If a particular address is accepted by your server, that
	  address is added into the spammer's arsenal.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Some sites, particularly larger ones, find that they are
	  frequent targets of such attacks.  From the spammer's
	  perspective, chances of finding a given username on a
	  large site is better than on sites with only a few users.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  One effective way to combat dictionary attacks is to issue
	  increasing transaction delays for each failed address.  For
	  instance, the first non-existing recipient address can be
	  rejected with a 20-second delay, the second address with a
	  30-second delay, and so on.
