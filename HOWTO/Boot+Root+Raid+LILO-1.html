<P>The essence of the information I've put together here was originally provided by 
Harald Nordgård-Hansen <CODE>&lt;</CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:hnh@bukharin.hiof.no">hnh@bukharin.hiof.no</A><CODE>></CODE> and posted to the raid
mail list in a lilo.conf file with commentary by  Martin Bene <CODE>&lt;</CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:mb@sime.com">mb@sime.com</A><CODE>></CODE>. Many thanks for your contribution. I've tried to
put this information and the helpful work of many others who contribute to
the raid mail list and linux raid project into a <B>COOKBOOK</B> form,
including many examples from real systems so that bootable
root raid is easy to set up and understand. One section is devoted to the
conversion of a standard single drive system to RAID. The key to the
conversion, in my humble opinion, is the understanding of bootable root
raid.

<P>Yes, I'm sure there are some. If you'd be good enough to report them, I will
correct the document. ;-)
