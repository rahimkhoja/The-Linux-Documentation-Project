<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 History</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The <EM>Umsdos</EM> project was started in 1992 and made available
to the net in January 1994 as a patch. It was included in the standard
kernel distribution in July, starting with kernel 1.1.36.
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> was early adopted in the <EM>Slackware</EM> distribution
even before it was officially included in the official kernel.
<P><EM>Umsdos</EM> was improved starting at kernel 1.1.60. Its performance
has been dramatically enhanced, especially for writing. Since 1.1.70
(around this), it is stable again.
<P>A major bug was solve in <EM>Linux</EM> 1.2.2. This bug was causing
some grief to users since the beginning (some file were
silently renamed, giving the sad impression that they were
deleted). Beware that <EM>Slackware</EM> 2.2 is still shipping
release 1.2.1 of the kernel, so has this bug.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Availability</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>It is available as a patch for kernel 1.0.x. It is built-in
for kernel 1.2. It can be compiled in or load as a module.
Beware that for now, if you intend to load <EM>umsdos</EM> as a module,
you must also use the Ms-DOS fs as a module. This come from
a limitation in the module system (some symbols are only
export when the drivers is installed as a module).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Distribution supporting it</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>So far, I think only <EM>Slackware</EM> does support it. I am surely
wrong, so please send me info to correct this.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Home site</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The home site for <EM>Umsdos</EM> is sunsite.unc.edu. Look in
the directory <CODE>/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/umsdos</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Technical documentation</A>
</H2>

<P>There is quite a lot of documentation about the internal of
<EM>Umsdos</EM>. It is available both in <CODE>HTML</CODE> and text format
at the same location as the utilities.
<P>As far as I know, the <CODE>HTML</CODE> version is not available online
on any web site. You must down-load it and "UN-tar" it and
read it locally.
