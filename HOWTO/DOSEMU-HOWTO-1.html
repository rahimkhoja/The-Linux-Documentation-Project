<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is dosemu, anyway?</A>
</H2>

<P>To quote the manual, "dosemu" is a user-level program which uses
certain special features of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor
to run MS-DOS/FreeDOS/DR-DOS in what we in the biz call a `DOS box.'
The DOS box, a combination of hardware and software trickery, has these
capabilities:
<P>o the ability to virtualize all input/output and processor control
instructions
<P>o the ability to support the word size and addressing modes of the
iAPX86 processor family's "real mode," while still running within
the full protected mode environment
<P>o the ability to trap all DOS and BIOS system calls and emulate such
calls as are necessary for proper operation and good performance
<P>o the ability to simulate a hardware environment over which DOS
programs are accustomed to having control.
<P>o the ability to provide DOS services through native Linux
services; for example, dosemu can provide a virtual hard disk
drive which is actually a Linux directory hierarchy."
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What operating systems does dosemu work under ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Dosemu is primarily written for Linux. It also works on NetBSD and
possibly FreeBSD, however the graphics emulation is unlikely to work
on NetBSD, which means that all DOS programs that use graphics mode
(most DOS programs) will not work under NetBSD.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What processors does dosemu work on ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Dosemu only works on Intel 80x86 processors, e.g. 80386, 80486, 
Pentium etc.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What if I have an Alpha/Sparc/Motorola/other non-Intel CPU ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Dosemu only works on Intel 80x86 processors but there are alternatives:
Bochs (<B>
<A HREF="http://www.bochs.com">http://www.bochs.com</A></B>) is an open
source shareware PC emulator that
runs on most Unixes (as well as MS-Windows), and there are other
(non-free) alternatives - see the comp.emulators.misc FAQ, available via
usenet or <B>
<A HREF="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/emulators/misc/">ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/emulators/misc/</A></B>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Do I need MS-DOS to use dosemu ?</A>
</H2>

<P>No. You need some version of DOS but not necessarily MS-DOS.
See the section "What versions of DOS are known to run with dosemu ?"
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 Can I run Microsoft Windows programs under dosemu ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Not reliably. You would be better to use the Windows emulator
Wine (<B>
<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com">http://www.winehq.com</A></B>). If you insist on running Windows
under dosemu, see section 8 - dosemu and MS-Windows 3.1.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 I want to run something that won't run under DOSemu or Wine</A>
</H2>

<P>See section 1.4.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 Names and numbers</A>
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
(xx/yy/zz) means day zz in month yy in year xx.
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
winemu mean WinOS/2 running in dosemu.
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9 What version of Dosemu should I use?</A>
</H2>

<P>Dosemu uses the same numbering scheme as the kernel. Uneven second
numbers are for possible unstable developer releases, even second numbers
are for releases considered stable. At the time of writing, <B>0.98.8</B>
is the latest stable release, while <B>0.99.10</B> is the latest
developer's release. So if you want to use dosemu, get the latest 
<B>stable</B> release. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.10">1.10 What's the newest version of dosemu and where can I get it?</A>
</H2>

<P>The newest version of dosemu as of 99/04/09 is
<B>dosemu0.98.8</B> and can be ftp'ed from:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/pub/dosemu/">ftp://ftp.dosemu.org/pub/dosemu/</A></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<P>Remember that this is ALPHA code, however: there may be serious bugs
and very little documentation for new features. The development version 
is particularly likely to have bugs. Please use it only if you
like to do active development. Don't report bugs in the development
version, fix them instead.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.11">1.11 Where can I ask questions?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have problems regarding installing and running dosemu after
reading the documentation, first try to help yourself: Your question
has probably been asked and perhaps answered before. Try some search
engine on the internet to retrieve that information. E.g. you can ask
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">http://www.dejanews.com</A></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to find all newsnet articles containing the keywords of your
question. Helping yourself will probably be faster than asking a well
known question. It also frees up the time of developers from answering
trivial question and so helps the further development of dosemu.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.12">1.12 Where can I report bugs and ask questions?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to ask questions and report bugs regarding dosemu, you
should consider subscribing to the linux-msdos mailing list.
To subscribe, send mail to <B>
<A HREF="mailto:Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A></B>
with the following command in the body of your email message:
<PRE>
    subscribe linux-msdos your_username@your.email.address
</PRE>

If you ever want to remove yourself from the mailing list, you can
send mail to <B>
<A HREF="mailto:Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A></B>
with the following command in the body of your email message:
<PRE>
    unsubscribe linux-msdos your_username@your.email.address
</PRE>

(95/8/11). When you are subscribed to linux-msdos, you can send your
report as mail to linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu. There is a gate that
send mails to linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu as postings to the
newsgroup named <B>linux.dev.msdos</B>. If your News provider
doesn't carry that group, ask her(him) to add that group. 
Before you ask a question, you should carefully read all of the
documentation, including this HOWTO and check one of the mailing list
archives listed at <B>
<A HREF="http://www.dosemu.org/mailinglist.html">http://www.dosemu.org/mailinglist.html</A></B> to see whether your
question has already been asked and answered.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.13">1.13 What documentation is available for dosemu?</A>
</H2>

<P>Dosemu comes with documentation. The main documentation files
README.txt and README-tech.txt cover virtually all aspects of dosemu
and may be more up-to-date than this HOWTO.
<P>The "dosemu Novice's Altering Guide" or DANG is a road map to the
inner workings of dosemu.  It is designed for the adventurous, those
who wish to modify the source code themselves.  The DANG is maintained
by Alistair MacDonald (<B>
<A HREF="mailto:alistair@slitesys.demon.co.uk">alistair@slitesys.demon.co.uk</A></B>) and is
found in the doc directory of the dosemu source tree.
<P>
<P>The EMU failure list (EMUfailure.txt) is a partial list of programs known
<B>not</B> to work under dosemu.
<P>
<P>And then, of course, there is the dosemu FAQ/HOWTO.  But you already
know about that, don't you.  It is also posted once in a while to the
mailing list and found in the doc-directory.  The most recent version
can be found at <B>
<A HREF="http://www.dosemu.org">http://www.dosemu.org</A></B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.14">1.14 I have a program that fails, not listed in EMUfailure.txt </A>
</H2>

<P>First check, if the failure of your program is not caused by some
of the fundamental incapabilities of dosemu, listed in EMUfailure.txt. If
you think you have something new, please report to 
<A HREF="mailto:linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu">linux-msdos@vger.rutgers.edu</A>.
Perhaps it can be made going with the help others. Give detailed
information about your setup, tell the version of kernel, dosemu etc
and name the observed errors. You can use xdos to cut and paste the
error message into your report. But keep your report in a readable
form. We know the content of ../etc/config.dist. So only send the
active lines from your dosemu.conf. Try running dosemu with some or all
debug output turned on and scan through your debug output
and at first only send those parts you think are relevant. Few people
are willing to decode some long attachment to a mail, to do debugging
for others. But keep your logs at hand, in case others ask detailed
questions.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.15">1.15 How do I submit changes or additions to the HOWTO?</A>
</H2>

<P>The preferred method is to edit the file
<B>dosemu-HOWTO-xx.x.sgml</B> to incorporate the changes, create a
diff file by typing something like
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
diff -uw original-file new-file
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and send it to <B>
<A HREF="mailto:davidhodges@altavista.net">davidhodges@altavista.net</A></B>.
If you do not know SGML, that's ok.  Changes or new information in any
form will be accepted.  Creating the diff file just makes it easier on
the HOWTO maintainer.  :-)
