<H2><A NAME="s3">3. General Setup and Kernel Module Issues</A></H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Kernel Module Support</A>
</H2>

<P>All of the kernel drivers listed here are released as kernel modules; therefore,
you must be sure to have a kernel which supports modules.  In addition, 
"module version" support should be enabled to aid the use of 
kernels and modules which are not version matched, as described further below.
If you use a kernel from a reasonably recent Linux distribution, such module support
is most likely already enabled.  If you're compiling the kernel yourself, then you
should already be aware of how to enable modules, via the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HOWTO</A>.  
In any case, you can check to make sure that the following
settings exist in your kernel configuration  file
(which is usually found under <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE>):
<PRE>
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
</PRE>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 ISA Plug-n-Play</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have an ISA Plug-n-Play modem, you will most likely 
need to use isapnptools to allocate resources to the modem card.
For this, you need to have isapnptools installed and have an entry in 
the <CODE>/etc/isapnp.conf</CODE> file
for the modem.  You should read the manual pages and the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html">Plug-and-Play-HOWTO</A>, but if you have no other 
ISA devices you're concerned about, basically all you need to do is:
<OL>
<LI> If possible, configure your BIOS to "Non-PNP OS."</LI>
<LI> As root, run <CODE>pnpdump</CODE> to generate a prototype isapnp.conf
file based on probed cards and your system's current resource usage.</LI>
<LI> Look for your modem in this output, and uncomment the lines
corresponding to the (otherwise unused) IRQ you wish to use for the
modem.  For example, Sean's <CODE>isapnp.conf</CODE> for a Thinkpad i1411 with
a Lucent LT modem includes:
<P>
<PRE>
(CONFIGURE ACRd119/1 (LD 0                   
  (INT 0 (IRQ 11 (MODE +E)))                   
  (IO 1 (SIZE 8) (BASE 0x0100) (CHECK))       
  (NAME "ACRd119/1[0]{LT Win Modem        }") 
# (ACT Y)                                    
))                                           
</PRE>

Strangely, in this case at least, it was necessary to leave
the <CODE>#(ACT Y)</CODE> commented out.  If it doesn't work for you one way,
try it the other.
</LI>
<LI> Copy the file to <CODE>/etc/isapnp.conf</CODE></LI>
<LI> Reboot.  You should see a message along the lines of 'Initializing
ISA PNP devices...OK' on booting.  If it fails, you have probably selected
an IRQ/DMA setting which is already in use; try another of the options
given in the <CODE>pnpdump</CODE> output.
(Note that it is probably not necessary to reboot, if you run <CODE>isapnp</CODE>
with the right flags.  However, it's easiest for the beginner to simply reboot
at this point.)</LI>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 PCI Modems</A>
</H2>

<P>   
If you wish to know more about your PCI modem
than <CODE>cat /proc/pci</CODE> gives, utilities within the software package
<CODE>pciutils</CODE> are useful, such as <CODE>scanpci</CODE> and <CODE>lspci</CODE>.
In particular, <CODE>lspci -vv</CODE> gives lots of nice, useful information.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Module tools</A>
</H2>

<P>The following commands are useful when dealing with modules.  Many
require root priveleges.  See the manual pages (e.g., <CODE>man insmod</CODE>)
for more detailed information on these commands.
<P>
<H3>insmod, insmod -f, and modprobe</H3>

<P>A version-matched kernel module should usually be inserted using the command 
<CODE>modprobe</CODE> <EM>module_name</EM>; <CODE>modprobe</CODE> will try to
insert any other modules on which your module depends (as determined
by <CODE>depmod</CODE>, described below). 
<P>A single module can be inserted (without those modules on which it depends)
using the command <CODE>insmod</CODE> <EM>module_name</EM>.  
If the module were compiled under a different kernel than the current one,
<CODE>insmod</CODE> would report the version mismatch and refuse load the module.
One can, however, pass a flag to force the module to load despite the mismatch:
<CODE>insmod -f</CODE> <EM>module_name</EM>.  If the kernel interface the
module uses did not actually change with the kernel version, the
module will be inserted and could be to some degree functional.  
<P>This is the case with, for example, the ESS modem module <CODE>esscom.o</CODE>
which, while compiled under 2.2.12, can be forcibly inserted with later kernels
and will function to a greater or lesser extent up through kernel version 2.2.14
without further changes; beyond 2.2.15, the patch to <CODE>tty.h</CODE> described
below is required.  However, even forcing insertion fails for kernels
from the 2.4 series.
<P>
<P>
<H3>rmmod</H3>

<P>A module can be unloaded (removed from the kernel) after use by issuing
the command <CODE>rmmod</CODE>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>depmod</H3>

<P>The <CODE>depmod</CODE> commands analyzes module dependencies.
The compatility of precompiled modules with a running kernel
can be checked with a command like:
<PRE>
   depmod -e ltmodem.o
</PRE>

For the specific example of the ltmodem.o module compiled under kernel 2.2.12
with a running kernel 2.2.17, the returned information includes:
<UL>
<LI> depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in ltmodem.o</LI>
<LI> depmod:    bh_mask</LI>
<LI> depmod:    schedule_timeout</LI>
<LI> depmod:    request_region</LI>
<LI> depmod:    pcibios_read_co</LI>
<LI>  and many others.</LI>
</UL>

Using a module with unresolved symbols can be a dangerous thing, as described
below.
