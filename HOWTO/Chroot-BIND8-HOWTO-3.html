<P>You should be able to find the BIND source by visiting 
<A HREF="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">http://www.isc.org/bind.html</A>.  You need the <CODE>bind-src.tar.gz</CODE>
package.  Be sure to get the latest version!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Modifying Paths</A>
</H2>

<P>Things can get a bit confusing at this point, because different parts of the
BIND package will be referring to the same directories by different names
(depending on whether or not they're running inside the jail).  I'll try not to
confuse you <B>too</B> much :-).
<P>The main directory that we have to worry about here is <CODE>/var/run</CODE>, because
its contents are required for both the main <CODE>named</CODE> daemon (inside the
jail), and the <CODE>ndc</CODE> utility (on the outside).  We'll start by setting
everything up to find this directory from the outside world.  To do this, we
need to modify <CODE>src/port/linux/Makefile.set</CODE> (substitute your port's
directory if you're not running Linux), and change the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DESTRUN=/var/run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DESTRUN=/chroot/named/var/run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

While you're in there, you may want to change the other destination paths from
<CODE>/usr</CODE> to <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>.
<P>Now everything should be able to find that directory... except the <CODE>named</CODE>
daemon itself, to which it's still just <CODE>/var/run</CODE> inside the jail.  We can
get around this by making a small change in the <CODE>named</CODE> source.  In the file
<CODE>src/bin/named/named.h</CODE>, find the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#include "pathnames.h"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and add the following line immediately after it
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#define _PATH_NDCSOCK    "/var/run/ndc"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This way, <CODE>named</CODE> will ignore our definition of <CODE>DESTRUN</CODE> over in
<CODE>Makefile.set</CODE> and use the correct location (from its perspective in the
chroot jail).  You will notice some warnings about redefinitions of
_PATH_NDCSOCK when you do the build; just ignore them.
<P>

</H2>

<P>You should now be able to compile BIND as normal, following the instructions in
the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file.  At this stage, we only want to compile BIND, not install
it.  Don't go too far when following the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file.  Essentially, it's
just <CODE>make clean</CODE>, <CODE>make depend</CODE>, and <CODE>make</CODE>.
