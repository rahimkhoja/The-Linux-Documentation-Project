<P>This HOWTO is about packet filtering.  This means deciding whether a
packet should be allowed to pass or not.  However, Linux being the
hacker's playground that it is, you probably want to do more than
that.
<P>
<P>One problem is that the same tool (``ipchains'') is used to control
both masquerading and transparent proxying, although these are
notionally separate from packet filtering (the current Linux
implementation blurs these together unnaturally, leaving the
impression that they are closely related).
<P>
<P>Masquerading and proxying are covered by separate HOWTOs, and the auto
forwarding and port forwarding features are controlled by separate
tools, but since so many people keep asking me about it, I'll include
a set of common scenarios and indicate when each one should be
applied.  The security merits of each setup will not be discussed
here.

<P>You can buy off-the-shelf firewalls.  An excellent one is WatchGuard's
FireBox.  It's excellent because I like it, it's secure, it's
Linux-based, and because they funded the maintenance of ipchains as
well as the new firewalling code (for 2.4).  In short, WatchGuard were
paying for me to eat while I work for you.  So please consider their

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Common Firewall-like Setups</A>
</H2>

<P>You run littlecorp.com.  You have an internal network, and a single
dialup (PPP) connection to the Internet (firewall.littlecorp.com which
is 1.2.3.4).  You run Ethernet on your local network, and your
personal machine is called "myhost".
<P>
<P>This section will illustrate the different arrangement which are
common.  Read carefully, because they are each subtly different.
<P>
<H3>Private Network: Traditional Proxies</H3>

<P>In this scenario, packets from the private network never traverse the
Internet, and vice versa.  The IP addresses of the private network
should be assigned from the RFC1918 Address Allocation for Private
Internets (ie. 10.*.*.*, 172.16.*.*-172.31.*.* or 192.168.*.*).
<P>
<P>The only way things ever connect to the Internet is by connecting to
the firewall, which is the only machine on both networks which
connects onwards.  You run a program (on the firewall) called a proxy
to do this (there are proxies for FTP, web access, telnet, RealAudio,
Usenet News and other services).  See the Firewall HOWTO.
<P>
<P>Any services you wish the Internet to access must be on the firewall.
(But see 
<A HREF="#limited-services">Limited Internal Services</A>
below).
<P>
<P>Example: Allowing web access from private network to the Internet.
<OL>
<LI> The private network is assigned 192.168.1.* addresses, with
myhost being 192.168.1.100, and the firewall's Ethernet interface
being assigned 192.168.1.1.
</LI>
<LI> A web proxy (eg. "squid") is installed and configured on the
firewall, say running on port 8080.
</LI>
<LI> Netscape on the private network is configured to use the
firewall port 8080 as a proxy.

<LI> DNS does not need to be configured on the private network.

<OL>
<LI> Netscape connects to the firewall port 8080, using port 1050 on
myhost.  It asks for the web page of "http://slashdot.org".
</LI>
<LI> The proxy looks up the name "slashdot.org", and gets
207.218.152.131.  It then opens a connection to that IP address (using
port 1025 on the firewall's external interface), and asks the web
server (port 80) for the web page.
</LI>
<LI> As it receives the web page from its connection to the web
server, it copies the data to the connection from Netscape.
</LI>
<LI> Netscape renders the page.</LI>

<P>ie.  From slashdot.org's point of view, the connection is made from
1.2.3.4 (firewall's PPP interface) port 1025 to 207.218.152.131

<H3>Private Network: Transparent Proxies</H3>

<P>In this scenario, packets from the private network never traverse the
Internet, and vice versa.  The IP addresses of the private network
should be assigned from the RFC1918 Address Allocation for Private
Internets (ie. 10.*.*.*, 172.16.*.*-172.31.*.* or 192.168.*.*).
<P>
<P>The only way things ever connect to the Internet is by connecting to
the firewall, which is the only machine on both networks, which
connects onwards.  You run a program (on the firewall) called a
transparent proxy to do this; the kernel sends outgoing packets to the
transparent proxy instead of sending them onwards (ie. it bastardizes
routing).
<P>
<P>Transparent proxying means that the clients don't need to know there
is a proxy involved.
<P>
<P>Any services you wish the Internet to access must be on the firewall.

</LI>
<LI> As the packets from myhost (port 1050) to slashdot.org (port

is where the original packets were going).

proxy.
<P>
<H3>Private Network: Masquerading</H3>

<P>In this scenario, packets from the private network never traverse the
Internet without special treatment, and vice versa.  The IP addresses
of the private network should be assigned from the RFC1918 Address
Allocation for Private Internets (ie. 10.*.*.*, 172.16.*.*-172.31.*.*
or 192.168.*.*).
<P>
<P>Instead of using a proxy, we use a special kernel facility called
"masquerading".  Masquerading rewrites packets as they pass through
the firewall, so that they always seem to come from the firewall
itself.  It then rewrites the responses so that they look like they
are going to the original recipient.
<P>
<P>Masquerading has separate modules to handle "tricky" protocols, such
as FTP, RealAudio, Quake, etc.  For really hard-to-handle protocols,
the "auto forwarding" facility can handle some of them by
automatically setting up port forwarding for related sets of ports:
look for ``ipportfw'' (2.0 kernels) or ``ipmasqadm'' (2.1 kernels).
<P>
<P>Any services you wish the Internet to access must be on the firewall.
(But see 
<A HREF="#limited-services">Limited Internal Services</A>

</LI>
<LI> The firewall is set up to masquerade any packets coming from
the private network and going to port 80 on an Internet host.
</LI>

</LI>
<LI> As the packets from myhost (port 1050) to slashdot.org (port
80) pass through the firewall, they are rewritten to come from the PPP
interface of the firewall, port 65000.  The firewall has a valid

routed back OK.
</LI>

firewall.littlecorp.com (port 65000) come in, they are rewritten to go

remembers when it rewrites outgoing packets to it can write them back
as replies come in.

<H3>Public Network</H3>

<P>In this scenario, your personal network is a part of the Internet:
packets can flow without change across both networks.  The IP
addresses of the internal network must be assigned by applying for a
block of IP addresses, so the rest of the network will know how to get
packets to you.  This implies a permanent connection.
<P>
<P>In this role, packet filtering is used to restrict which packets can
be forwarded between your network and the rest of the Internet, eg. to
restrict the rest of the Internet to only accessing your internal web
servers.
<P>
<P>Example: Allowing web access from private network to the Internet.

block you have registered, (say 1.2.3.*).

<H3><A NAME="limited-services"></A> Limited Internal Services</H3>

<P>There are a few tricks you can pull to allow the Internet to access
your internal services, rather than running the services on the
firewall.  These will work with either a proxy or masquerading based
approach for external connections.
<P>
<P>The simplest approach is to run a "redirector", which is a poor-man's
proxy which waits for a connection on a given port, and then open a
connection a fixed internal host and port, and copies data between the
two connections.  An example of this is the "redir" program.  From the
Internet point of view, the connection is made to your firewall.
From your internal server's point of view, the connection is made from
the internal interface of the firewall to the server.
<P>
<P>Another approach (which requires a 2.0 kernel patched for ipportfw, or
a 2.1 or later kernel) is to use port forwarding in the kernel.  This
does the same job as "redir" in a different way: the kernel rewrites
packets as they pass through, changing their destination address and
ports to point them at an internal host and port.  From the Internet's
point of view, the connection is made to your firewall.  From your
internal server's point of view, a direct connection is made from the
Internet host to the server.
