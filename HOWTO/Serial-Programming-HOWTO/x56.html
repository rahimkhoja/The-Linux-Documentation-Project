>2.1. Debugging</A

><P
>      The best way to debug your code is to set up another Linux box, and
      connect the two computers via a null-modem cable. Use miniterm
      (available from the LDP programmers guide
      (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/programmers-guide/lpg-0.4.tar.gz</TT
>
      in the examples directory) to transmit characters to your Linux
      box. Miniterm can be compiled very easily and will transmit all
      keyboard input raw over the serial port. Only the define statement
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define MODEMDEVICE "/dev/ttyS0"</TT
> has to be checked. Set it to
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ttyS0</TT
> for COM1, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ttyS1</TT
> for COM2, etc.. It is
      essential for testing, that <EM
>all</EM
> characters are transmitted raw
      (without output processing) over the line. To test your connection,
      start miniterm on both computers and just type away. The characters
      input on one computer should appear on the other computer and vice
      versa. The input will not be echoed to the attached screen.
    </P
><P
>      To make a null-modem cable you have to cross the TxD (transmit) and
      RxD (receive) lines. For a description of a cable see sect. 7 of the
      Serial-HOWTO. 
    </P
><P
>      It is also possible to perform this testing with only one computer, if
      you have two unused serial ports. You can then run two miniterms off
      two virtual consoles. If you free a serial port by disconnecting the
      mouse, remember to redirect <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/mouse</TT
> if it exists. If you
      use a multiport serial card, be sure to configure it correctly. I had
      mine configured wrong and everything worked fine as long as I was
      testing only on my computer. When I connected to another computer, the port
      started loosing characters. Executing two programs on one computer
      just isn't fully asynchronous.

      has to be kept in mind when programming communication with a raw
      device. E.g. the ports are configured to echo characters sent from the
      device back to it, which normally has to be changed for data
      transmission.

      block, until the read is satisfied. In asynchronous mode the
      <TT

></H3
><P
>      This is not a different input mode, but might be useful, if you are
      handling multiple devices. In my application I was handling input over
      a TCP/IP socket and input over a serial connection from another computer
      quasi-simultaneously. The program example given below will wait for
      input from two different input sources. If input from one source
      becomes available, it will be processed, and the program will then
      wait for new input.
    </P
><P
>      The approach presented below seems rather complex, but it is important
      to keep in mind that Linux is a multi-processing operating system. The
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>select</TT
> system call will not load the CPU while waiting for
      input, whereas looping until input becomes available would slow down
      other processes executing at the same time.
