<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Packet Filtering Basics</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What?</A>
</H2>

<P>All traffic through a network is sent in the form of <B>packets</B>.  For
example, downloading this package (say it's 50k long) might cause you
to receive 36 or so packets of 1460 bytes each, (to pull numbers at
random).
<P>
<P>The start of each packet says where it's going, where it came from,
the type of the packet, and other administrative details.  This start
of the packet is called the <B>header</B>.  The rest of the packet,
containing the actual data being transmitted, is usually called the
<B>body</B>.
<P>
<P>Some protocols, such <B>TCP</B>, which is used for web traffic, mail, and
remote logins, use the concept of a `connection' -- before any packets
with actual data are sent, various setup packets (with special
headers) are exchanged saying `I want to connect', `OK' and `Thanks'.
Then normal packets are exchanged.
<P>
<P>A packet filter is a piece of software which looks at the <EM>header</EM>
of packets as they pass through, and decides the fate of the entire
packet.  It might decide to <B>deny</B> the packet (ie. discard the
packet as if it had never received it), <B>accept</B> the packet
(ie. let the packet go through), or <B>reject</B> the packet (like deny,
but tell the source of the packet that it has done so).
<P>
<P>Under Linux, packet filtering is built into the kernel, and there are
a few trickier things we can do with packets, but the general
principle of looking at the headers and deciding the fate of the
packet is still there.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Why?</A>
</H2>

<P>Control.  Security.  Watchfulness.
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Control:</B><DD><P>when you are using a Linux box to connect your internal
network to another network (say, the Internet) you have an opportunity
to allow certain types of traffic, and disallow others.  For example,
the header of a packet contains the destination address of the packet,
so you can prevent packets going to a certain part of the outside
network.  As another example, I use Netscape to access the Dilbert
archives.  There are advertisements from doubleclick.net on the page,
and Netscape wastes my time by cheerfully downloading them.
Telling the packet filter not to allow any packets to or from the
addresses owned by doubleclick.net solves that problem (there are
better ways of doing this though).
<P>
<DT><B>Security:</B><DD><P>when your Linux box is the only thing between the
chaos of the Internet and your nice, orderly network, it's nice to
know you can restrict what comes tromping in your door.  For example,
you might allow anything to go out from your network, but you might be
worried about the well-known `Ping of Death' coming in from malicious
outsiders.  As another example, you might not want outsiders
telnetting to your Linux box, even though all your accounts have
passwords; maybe you want (like most people) to be an observer on the
Internet, and not a server (willing or otherwise) -- simply don't let
anyone connect in, by having the packet filter reject incoming packets
used to set up connections.
<P>
<DT><B>Watchfulness:</B><DD><P>sometimes a badly configured machine on the local
network will decide to spew packets to the outside world.  It's nice
to tell the packet filter to let you know if anything abnormal occurs;
maybe you can do something about it, or maybe you're just curious by
nature.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="basics-how"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 How?</A>
</H2>

<H3>A Kernel With Packet Filtering</H3>

<P>You need a kernel which has the new IP firewall chains in it.
You can tell if the kernel you are running right now has this
installed by looking for the file `/proc/net/ip_fwchains'.  If it
exists, you're in.
<P>
<P>If not, you need to make a kernel that has IP firewall chains.
First, download the source to the kernel you want.  If you have a
kernel numbered 2.1.102 or higher, you won't need to patch it (it's in
the mainstream kernel now).  Otherwise, apply the patch from the web
page listed above, and set the configuration as detailed below.  If
you don't know how to do this, don't panic -- read the Kernel-HOWTO.
<P>
<P>
<P>The configuration options you will need to set <EM>for the 2.0-series
kernel</EM> are:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=y
        CONFIG_FIREWALL=y
        CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL=y
        CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_CHAINS=y
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>For the <EM>2.1 or 2.2 series kernels</EM>:
<HR>
<PRE>
        CONFIG_FIREWALL=y
        CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL=y
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>The tool <CODE>ipchains</CODE> talks to the kernel and tells it what packets to
filter.  Unless you are a programmer, or overly curious, this is how
you will control the packet filtering.
<P>
<H3>ipchains</H3>

<P>The <CODE>ipchains</CODE> tool inserts and deletes rules from the kernel's packet
filtering section.  This means that whatever you set up, it will be
lost upon reboot; see 
<A HREF="#permanent">Making Rules Permanent</A> 
for how to make sure they are restored the next time Linux is booted.
<P>
<P><CODE>ipchains</CODE> replaces <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE>, which was used for the
old IP Firewall code.  There is a set of useful scripts available from
the ipchains ftp site:
<P>
<A HREF="http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/ipchains/ipchains-scripts-1.1.2.tar.gz">http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/ipchains/ipchains-scripts-1.1.2.tar.gz</A><P>
<P>This contains a shell script called <CODE>ipfwadm-wrapper</CODE> which
allows you to do packet filtering as it was done before.  You probably
shouldn't use this script unless you want a quick way of upgrading a
system which uses <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE> (it's slower, and doesn't check
arguments, etc).  In that case, you don't need this HOWTO much either.
<P>See Appendix 
<A HREF="IPCHAINS-HOWTO-8.html#ipfwadm-diff">Differences between ipchains and ipfwadm</A> 
and Appendix 
<A HREF="IPCHAINS-HOWTO-9.html#upgrade">Using the `ipfwadm-wrapper' script</A> 
for more details on <CODE>ipfwadm</CODE> issues.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="permanent"></A> Making Rules Permanent</H3>

<P>Your current firewall setup is stored in the kernel, and thus will
be lost on reboot.  I recommend using the `ipchains-save' and
`ipchains-restore' scripts to make your rules permanent.  To do this,
set up your rules, then run (as root):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# ipchains-save > /etc/ipchains.rules
#
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Create a script like the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
# Script to control packet filtering.

# If no rules, do nothing.
[ -f /etc/ipchains.rules ] || exit 0

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo -n "Turning on packet filtering:"
        /sbin/ipchains-restore &lt; /etc/ipchains.rules || exit 1
        echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        echo "."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo -n "Turning off packet filtering:"
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        /sbin/ipchains -F
        /sbin/ipchains -X
        /sbin/ipchains -P input ACCEPT
        /sbin/ipchains -P output ACCEPT
        /sbin/ipchains -P forward ACCEPT
        echo "."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/packetfilter {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Make sure this is run early in the bootup procedure.  In my case
(Debian 2.1), I make a symbolic link called `S39packetfilter' in the
`/etc/rcS.d' directory (this will be run before S40network).
