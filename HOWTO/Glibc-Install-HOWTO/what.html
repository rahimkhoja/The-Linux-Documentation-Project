><P
>&#13;If you do not know what glibc is by now, don't worry! When I
first had problems with a new program I wanted to compile, I only
knew that my version of glibc was not sufficient for the
compile.  Now that I know more, I will try to explain in a very simple way what
glibc does.</P
><P
>The glibc package contains a library written in the
programming language of C.  Libraries are a very useful thing in programming;
instead of inventing the wheel from scratch for operations such as
computing the square-root of a number, such common functions
are stored in separate files&#8212;the so-called libraries.
When a new version of a library is published it often contains
some new functions, uses more efficient algorithms for already
implemented functions, and so on.</P
><P
>This is the reason why some programs complain about an older
version of glibc: the current version just does not contain all the functions
the program needs in order to run.</P
><P
>I know this is not technically correct in all detail, but it
gives you a basic understanding of the architecture behind.</P
