><P
>Sometimes you get configuration error telling you that, for example, a
requirement is not met&#8212;typical for software or other
library-packages which are to old. I encountered this with a series of
programs, especially during the compile of all the static
software. Normally there should be no problem: get an up-to-date
version of the software or libraries needed and then compile them
according to the description found in the source tree (usually
called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>README</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>INSTALL</TT
> or 
something similar).</P
><P
>But there are sometimes cases where this just does not want to work. For
example, I experienced problems compiling a new version of my
binutils (one of the reasons why I mention them in the
requirements), as I needed to compile glibc.
In return, the configure script for the binutils told me, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Your
glibc is to old!"</SPAN
>  So I thought, <EM
>Here the snake starts eating
its tail</EM
>. Thankfully there is a solution for this problem: if you 
can not take one big step, try taking smaller ones, but more of them.</P
><P
>In my distribution, a glibc with the version number 2.1.1 was
included. To get around the error I tried to compile version
2.1.3, which was no problem. After I installed this version of the
library, I tried to compile the binutils once more, and this time
all the requirements were met.</P
><P
>If you encounter such a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop,"</SPAN
> try to find out what 
version of the software required is the minimum, then download that version
(I think that is one of the reasons why so many old versions are
still lying around on the FTP servers). After successfully
compiling and installing, try to build the software that
complained about the version again; in most cases you should now be
able to compile. It may be necessary that you continue to use this method 
to compile missing or old software.
This is what I call <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the long tail of the rat"</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"domino-effect."</SPAN
>  You only wanted to do one thing, but you needed
to do many more before you could make the move you wanted to. It
might be very nasty, but there is one good side to it:  afterwards
you can be quite sure that many of the programs which were really
old will replaced by the time you finish your installation.
