<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 /sbin/init doesn't start.</A>
</H2>

<P>A common problem with /sbin/init is that some distributions (e.g., Red Hat
Linux) come with /sbin/init dynamically linked.  So you have to provide
a correct /lib setup to the client. An easy thing one could try is replacing
/sbin/init (for the client) with a statically linked ``Hello World'' program.
This way you know if it is something more basic, or ``just'' a problem with
dynamic linking.
<P>
<P>Also note that Busybox by default installs its <CODE>init</CODE> symlink in
<CODE>/bin</CODE> rather than <CODE>/sbin</CODE>.  You may need to move it or
pass an explicit <CODE>init=</CODE> parameter on the kernel command line, as
shown in the final example of the previous section.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 /dev troubles.</A>
</H2>

<P>If you get some garbled messages about ttys when booting, then you
should run a MAKEDEV from the client in the /dev directory. There are
rumors that this doesn't work with certain server OSes that use
64-bit device numbers; should you run into this, please consider updating
this section!  A potential solution would be to create a small /dev
ram disk early in the boot process and reinstall the device nodes each time,
or simply embed directly into the kernel a suitably initialized ramdisk.
