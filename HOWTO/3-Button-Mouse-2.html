<P>
<P>Most X applications are written with the assumption that the user will
be working with a 3 button mouse.  Serial mice are commonly used on
computers and are cheap to buy.  Many of these mice have 3 buttons and
claim to use the Microsoft protocol, which in theory means they are
ideal for the X windows setup.  (The record for the cheapest working
3 button mouse currently stands at $1.14!)
<P>
<P>Most dual-protocol mice will work in two modes:
<UL>
<LI>2-button Microsoft mode.</LI>
<LI>3-button MouseSystems mode.</LI>
</UL>

This document leads you through the different steps needed to configure your
mouse in these two different modes, especially the steps needed to use the 
more useful 3-button mode.
<P>
<P>As distributions become easier to set up, some of the problems ought to go away.
For instance, RedHat have a <CODE>mouseconfig</CODE> program to set things up for you.
However, some versions of RH5.0 had a bug in <CODE>mouseconfig</CODE>, so make
sure you check for patches.
