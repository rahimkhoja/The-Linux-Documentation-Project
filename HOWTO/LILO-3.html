<P>Most Lilo installations use a configuration file like the
following one:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
boot = /dev/hda   # or your root partition
delay = 10        # delay, in tenth of a second (so you can interact)
vga = 0           # optional. Use "vga=1" to get 80x50
#linear           # try "linear" in case of geometry problems.

image = /boot/vmlinux  # your zImage file
  root = /dev/hda1     # your root partition
  label = Linux        # or any fancy name
  read-only            # mount root read-only

other = /dev/hda4   # your dos partition, if any
  table = /dev/hda  # the current partition table
  label = dos       # or any non-fancy name
</PRE>
</P>

<P>You can have multiple ``image'' and ``other'' sections if you want. It's
not uncommon to have several kernel images configured in your
<EM>lilo.conf</EM>, at least if you keep up to date with kernel
development.</P>

</H2>

<P>If you compile a ``zImage'' kernel and it is too big to fit in half a
megabyte (this is common with new 2.1 kernels), you should build a
``big zImage'' instead: ``<CODE>make bzImage</CODE>''. To boot a big
kernel image nothing special is needed, but you need version 18 or
newer of Lilo. If your installation is older, you should upgrade your
Lilo package.</P>

</H2>

<P>Here I will give you an order of routines you have to do if you want
to have both Linux and NT entries under Lilo menu:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First of all, I would suggest you to install a fresh copy of
Windows NT 4.0 on your hard disk. I suppose that you already
made a backup of your important data, so the NT installation
shouldn't be a problem. During the NT installation, setup is
not going to ask you where to place NT's boot loader, so it
would be placed into the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your hard
disk. But, there is a possibility for a previous content of
the MBR to remain within the MBR (especially any previous
Lilo), so I would suggest you (before installation of NT) to
boot the computer with a DOS floppy diskette having DOS version
of FDISK. At the prompt a:\  just enter the command: fdisk /mbr  
and restart the computer again (without that floppy).


</LI>
<LI>After you have successfully installed your NT, you will see that
it uses the whole hard disk or a specific partition of the hard
disk (depending on what you decided during the setup process).
So, it is advisable to 'shrink' the partition where NT resides
in order to make some free space on the disk. Onto that free space
you will install your Linux. After you have your NT configured
and running, you have to boot your computer using a floppy
diskette with Partition Magic utility by Power Quest. It is a
graphical tool able to see all partitions on all hard disks you
have. The best thing is that you can make some changes with your
partitions but not to destroy your existing data. One of the
available changes is to make your existing partition(s) smaller,
so to get some free space on the disk(s) for other purposes.
Although you are advised to make a backup before you make any
changes to the partitions, I usually practice to 'shrink' NT's
partition before I installed anything but NT itself (so, if
needed, a repetitive re-installation wouldn't be a problem).
Well, Partition Magic (or any other similar utility you are
familiar with) will shrink your NT's partition (either NTFS or
FAT) to a smaller measure and place it to either the beginning
or to the end of the previous measure. It means that you may
choose to have your 'shrinked' NT partition at the beginning
or at the end of your disk (I usually choose NT to be at the
beginning, so the ending part of the disk will become a 'free
space'). After the 'shrinking' is finished, you may re-boot your
NT in order to check the new situation: you may use Windows
Explorer or Disk Administrator for that.


</LI>
<LI>So far so good. Next step is to install your Linux. Case you 
are familiar with RedHat distribution (I hope with other distros
is the same or similar), you start by putting your installation
CD in the drive and re-boot the computer). Well, when you are about
to choose what type of installation it will be (Gnome or KDE 
Workstation, Custom, etc.) you may choose whatever you planned
before, but I would suggest to install a Workstation at first.
This is good because Linux setup will find automatically the
free space on the (first) hard disk, make all partitions needed
for Linux, format them properly, make majority of option by
default so you won't have much pain during the setup (later, if
you want, you may either to add missing components or re-install
Linux as Custom over the existing linux partitions). Lilo should
go to the MBR.


</LI>
<LI>After it looks that Linux installation is finished, you are going
to re-start the computer and there there you will only see Lilo
with one Linux entry to boot (or maybe more than one Linux
entry, in case your hardware is multi-processor one). But, don't
panic! Your Windows NT is still there where you had installed it
before Linux. You should become some familiar with Linux as soon
as possible, in order to be able to find and edit your new
/etc/lilo.conf file. When you open this file for the first time,
you'll see that there is only one (or more) Linux entry. Well,
you should know the exact position (read: a partition) where
Windows NT has been installed, so you could add an appropriate
entry into /etc/lilo.conf file. After you do that, restart Lilo
and, after the next re-boot, you will have both 'linux' and 'nt'
entries under Lilo menu.

</H2>

<P>Well, you may use the same procedure as described above.
I suggest you to read 
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+WinNT.html">Linux+WindowsNT</A> mini-HOWTO that also talks 
about booting Windows 2000, which is installed on the same part of disk 
where Windows NT was <EM>before</EM>. There you'll find many useful details
regarding various Linux+WinNT/2000/98 combinations.</P>
