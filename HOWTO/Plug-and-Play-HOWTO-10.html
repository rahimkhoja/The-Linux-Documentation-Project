</H2>

<P>When two or more devices use the same interrupt line (and the same
IRQ number) it's either "Interrupt Sharing" or an "Interrupt
Conflict".  The PCI bus allows all PCI devices to share interrupts
with each other so this is called "sharing".  But if an ISA device (or
a LPC device ??) uses the same interrupt (IRQ) as some other device
(either PCI, ISA, or LPC ??) there is usually an interrupt conflict.</P>
<P>There are exceptions to what's stated above.  Some very old PCI
devices (pre 1995 ??) do not allow interrupt sharing.  Conversely, a
few ISA devices have been designed to share interrupts (between two
ISA devices ??) but both ISA devices must be designed this way and be
driven by software that knows about sharing interrupts.  The
motherboard must support it too.  The following discussion pertains to
PCs that have an ISA bus.</P>
<P>A conflict means that when an interrupt happens, no device driver (or
the wrong one) may be called and bad things happen like buffer
overruns (loss of data).  A device may nearly ground its interrupt
line when it's not sending its interrupt, thus preventing any other
device from using that interrupt wire.  That's OK if only that device
uses that interrupt.  But if a second device tries to use the same
interrupt line it can't do so.  If this second device also nearly
grounds the line when not sending an interrupt, then neither device
can use the interrupt.  But both Linux and the two devices are unaware
of this conflict and merrily send out interrupts anyway that mostly go
nowhere and are thus lost.</P>
<P>Interrupt conflicts were common when the IRQs were set by jumpers on
cards (ISA bus) because the kernel often didn't know how these jumpers
were set.  ISA plug-and-play (no jumpers on the cards) helped since
the software could change IRQs.  The demise of ISA in favor of PCI has
nearly eliminated IRQ conflicts.  Still, your PC likely has devices on
the motherboard (not on a plug-in card) on an ISA bus, a LPC bus, or
an X-bus.  But the BIOS and the kernel should know how these are set
and thus avoid using them for PCI devices, thereby avoiding interrupt
conflicts.  But there is still a possible interrupt problem with PCI
since it could run out of available interrupts, especially on older
PCs that only have 16 interrupts.</P>
<P>But IRQ sharing on the PCI bus, while eliminating the conflict
problem, has introduced another problem which is less serious: the IRQ
balancing problem.  If too many high-irq-issuing devices share the
same IRQ, it may cause delays in the IRQs getting serviced and can't
even result in buffer overruns and other errors.  This is not due to
congestion on the interrupt line, but it's due to the way that the
software determines which device issued the interrupt.  
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-11.html#pci_irq_share">PCI interrupt sharing</A></P>
<P>There are two types of interrupt conflicts.  One is a real conflict
as described above.  In this case interrupts don't work and the device
driver keeps trying to control its device and is not aware that
interrupts are not working.  The second type of interrupt conflict is
where a device driver is started but discovers that the interrupt it
needs is already in use so it issues an error message and exits.  The
message could say something like "resource busy", and not clearly
state that it was an interrupt problem.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc10.2">Real Interrupt Conflict</A>
</H2>

<P>Both the BIOS and the the kernel will not knowingly allow any
interrupt conflict, so how can they happen?   One way is if someone
has put an incorrect IRQ into a configuration file, such as giving a
parameter to a module like: irq=9.  In this example, suppose the irq
of the device is really irq5.  Then when another device driver starts
up where its device is set to irq5, you have two real devices using
irq5 and a real conflict.  The kernel approved of letting the second
device use irq5 since it erroneously thought that the first device was
using irq9 and that irq5 was free.</P>
<P>There are other cases like this where the kernel fails to know that an
irq is in use.  One is when an old ISA card with an irq set by a
jumper is present, but it's driver hasn't started yet (or it may not
even have a driver).  Another case is where the BIOS set an irq in the
hardware but no linux driver for that hardware ever started and Linux
doesn't know about that irq.  This can happen even for a PCI card and
the irq will show up in <EM>lspci -v</EM> but will not be in the
<EM>/proc/interrupts</EM> directory and thus not known by the kernel.
Is this a bug in the kernel?</P>
<P>What are the symptoms of an interrupt conflict.  One might think that
the devices will not work at all, but since the addresses are known,
the driver does communicate.  Interrupts are often used to control the
flow of data to and from the device and without interrupts, flow is not
controlled.  This may mean buffer overruns or even no flow at all
since interrupt are used to initiate flow.  For a serial modem, the
result is extremely slow flow with long pauses and frequent errors.
For a sound card it may mean that a word or two is heard and then
nothing more.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc10.3">No Interrupt Available</A>
</H2>

<P>This is when a device driver starts but immediately exits
in order to avoid an interrupt conflict.  It should display or log an
error message something like "resource busy".</P>
<P>One case when an ISA device is activated but can't be assigned an
interrupt (IRQ) since none are available.  Or an interrupt may be
available, but it can't be used since the hardware of the device that
needs the interrupt doesn't support the interrupt number available (or
the motherboard doesn't support it due to "routing" problems, see 
<A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO-7.html#pci_int">PCI Interrupts</A>).  If the ISA devices use up all
the interrupts, then one or more PCI cards may be in conflict since
they can't get any IRQs.</P>
<P>Normally, the BIOS will assign interrupts and will not create
conflicts.  But it may be forced to create conflicts if it runs out of
IRQs.  This can happen if someone has set up the BIOS to reserve certain
IRQs for legacy ISA devices that are not PnP.  These settings may be
wrong and should be checked out, especially if you're having problems.
For example, someone may have reserved an IRQ for an ISA card that has
long since been removed from the PC.  If you unreserved this IRQ then
this IRQ is available and and conflict disappears.</P>
<P>Sometimes the BIOS will solve the problem of an IRQ shortage by using
what it calls IRQ 0.  There is no such IRQ available since the real
IRQ 0 is permanently assigned to the computer's timer.  But IRQ 0
here means that the driver should use polling instead of IRQs.  This
means that the driver frequently checks the device (polls it) to see
if the device needs servicing by the interrupt service routine.  Of
course, this wastes computer time and there's more likelihood of a
buffer overrun inside a device since it might not get serviced by the
driver promptly enough.</P>
