<P>This mini-HOWTO is a guide how to do remote X applications.  It was
written for several reasons.
<OL>
<LI> Many questions have appeared on usenet on how to run a remote
X application.</LI>
<LI> I see many, many hints of ``use <CODE>xhost +hostname</CODE>'' or even
``<CODE>xhost +</CODE>'' to allow X connections. <B>This is ridiculously
insecure</B>, and there are better methods.</LI>
<LI> I do not know of a simple document that describes the options you
<EM>do</EM> have. Please inform me 
<A HREF="mailto:zweije@xs4all.nl">zweije@xs4all.nl</A> if you know more.</LI>

<P>This document has been written with unix-like systems in mind. If either
your local or remote operating system are of another flavour, you may
find here how things work. However, you will have to translate examples
yourself to apply to your own system(s).
