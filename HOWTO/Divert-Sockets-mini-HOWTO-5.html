<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Getting and Compiling the Source Code</A></H2>

<P>In order to use divert sockets under Linux you will
need two things - the kernel source code that has been
patched for divert sockets and the source code to ipchains-1.3.9
that, also, has been patched to use divert sockets.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Getting *The Source*</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="kernel"></A> Both pieces of source code can be retrieved from the divert socket
web-site 
<A HREF="http://www.anr.mcnc.org/~divert">http://www.anr.mcnc.org/~divert</A>
You can get the source code for divert sockets kernel in two
forms - as a patch to linux-2.2.12 that you have to apply to a
fresh 2.2.12 source, or as an already patched kernel tarball (much larger
than the patch). <EM>ipchains</EM> source is provided as complete source
tarball only.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Compiling </A>
</H2>

<P>Compiling <EM>ipchains</EM> is straightforward - simply say 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in the ipchains-1.3.9 subdirectory.
<P>
<P>When compiling the divert-socket kernel - use your favorite way
of configuring it: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make config
</PRE>
 or
<PRE>
make menuconfig
</PRE>
 or 
<PRE>
make xconfig
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Don't forget to enable "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
before proceeding. There are only three compile-time options that affect the 
behavior of divert sockets and they are explained in
the following 
<A HREF="#comp-time">section</A><P>
<H3><A NAME="comp-time"></A> Kernel compile-time options</H3>

<P>In order to enable divert sockets in your kernel you must enable
firewalling and IP firewalling first. The three kernel compile-time 
options that affect the behavior of divert sockets are:
<DL>
<DT><B>IP: divert sockets</B><DD><P>Enables the divert sockets in your kernel.
<DT><B>IP: divert pass-through</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="passthru"></A> Changes the behavior of DIVERT rules:
by default if a DIVERT rule is present in a firewall and no application
is listening on the port that the rule specifies, any packet that satisfies
the rule is silently dropped, as if it were a DENY rule. 
<P>Enabling the pass-through mode results in such packets continuing
their way through the IP stack as if nothing happened. This could be helpful
if you want to have a static rule in the firewall, but don't always want
to listen on it.
<DT><B>IP: always defragment</B><DD><P>Changes the way that the sockets deal with
fragmentation. By default the divert socket receives individual fragments
of packets that are larger than MTU, which it then forwards to user space.
The burden of defragmentation in this case lies with the application listening
on the divert socket. Also, an application cannot inject any fragments that
are larger than MTU, because they will be dropped (this is the limitation
of the kernel, not the divert sockets - Linux kernels up to 2.2.x do NOT
fragment raw packets with IP_HDRINCL option set). Typically, thats OK,
since if you simply reinject the fragments the way you received them,
everything will work fine, since none of them are going to be larger
than MTU.
<P>If you enable the <EM>always defragment</EM> option, then all the defragmentation
will be done for you in the kernel. This severely affects the performance of
the interception mechanism, since now every large packet you want intercepted
will first have to be reassembled prior to being forwarded to you, and then,
if you choose to reinject it - it will have to be fragmented again (the kernel
with this option will be enabled to fragment raw packets with IP_HDRINCL)
<P>
<P>This was the only option available for divert sockets under Linux 2.0.36 
because of the way the firewall code was structured - it only looked at the
first fragment of every packet and passed all other fragments without looking
at them. This way, if the first fragment were dropped by the firewall, the
rest of them would be eventually discarded by the defragmenter. That's why
in order for DIVERT sockets to work you were forced to compile the <EM>always
defragment</EM> option in, so that you would always get the whole packet diverted
to you and not just the first fragment.
<P>
<P>In 2.2.12, thanks to changes in the firewall code you now have an option of
having the kernel or yourself doing fragmentation/defragmentation.
<P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> the defragmentation feature has not been added as of release 1.0.4
of divert sockets. It is in the works though.
