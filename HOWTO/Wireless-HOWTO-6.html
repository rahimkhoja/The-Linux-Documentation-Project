<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Setup </A></H2>

<P>Here I report some examples (I hope useful!) on how to configure more diffuse
and not expansive Wireless Cards. 
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 General setup info </A>
</H2>

<P>Wireless cards have interface similar to any Ethernet cards, so you have
to add in /etc/conf.modules: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>&quot;alias ethx module&quot;, where ethx is the interface you want to
assign to your wireless card and module is name of kernel module. </LI>
<LI>&quot;options module io=0xAAA irq=I ...&quot;, where 0xAAA is the io base
address to assign the card, I is the IRQ and so on if there are other parameters.
 </LI>
</OL>
<P>After this you'll be able to use ifconfig and route commands to configure
your card at IP level. 
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Proxim Symphony </A>
</H2>

<P>Network type: FHSS, Adhoc only and with proprietary protocol OpenAir. 
<P>Web site:
<A HREF="http://www.proxim.com">http://www.proxim.com</A> where you need to download documentation and driver for Linux
and Win9x. 
<P>Drivers come with source code to compile: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>untar it in a empty directory </LI>
<LI>type make for help. </LI>
<LI>make modules; make modules_install to install the driver rlmod.o and the
utility rl2cfg.  </LI>
<LI>to run the driver (after modified /etc/conf.modules: see Par.6.1.) you
only need to turn up the interface with ifconfig command. </LI>
</OL>
<P>Utility rl2cfg (for help type man rl2cfg once done c step) let you change
typical data-link level settings: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>&quot;rl2cfg dev ethx sta&quot; to set it to station (Slave) </LI>
<LI>&quot;rl2cfg dev ethx msta&quot; to set it to master station (Master) </LI>
<LI>&quot;rl2cfg dev ethx alt&quot; to set it to automatically mode </LI>
</OL>
<P>This is all you have to know to get it properly working.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Webgear Aviator 2.4 and AviatorPro </A>
</H2>

<P>Network type: FHSS, Adhoc only for Aviator 2.4 and Infrastructure for AviatorPro.
<P>These cards need more for working, because you have to compile Pcmcia source
as they come with Pcmcia plug. 
<P>Web site is 
<A HREF="http://www.webgear.com">http://www.webgear.com</A>. 
<P>To configure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>You have to download source pcmcia and to expand it to /usr/src/pcmcia
(see Par 5.2)  </LI>
<LI>Download driver form 
<A HREF="http://www.webgear.com">http://www.webgear.com</A> and type &quot;tar zxvf driver.tgz&quot; in /usr/src/pcmcia
directory. </LI>
<LI>reconfig pcmcia (see Par 5.2) </LI>
<LI>Following instructions you have to append to file /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
entry &quot;source ./ray_cs.opts&quot;.  </LI>
<LI>Note that in /etc/pcmcia/ray_cs.opts there is a line like this: &quot;module
&quot;ray_cs&quot; opts &quot;...&quot;. Here you have to modify some settings
at data-link level present in "opts" .</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<PRE>
Arguments: 
</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>pc_debug=x , where x is the log level. </LI>
<LI>net_type=x, x=0 for AdHoc, x=1 for Infrastructure. </LI>
<LI>essid=x, x is the ESSID</LI>
</UL>
<P>Finally, to verify configuration with pc_debug &gt; 0, you will see data-link
messages in your console like these: &quot;network started&quot; for a new
Wireless network created and &quot;network joined&quot; for a new Wireless
network joined to another one. 
<P>Also File /proc/ray_cs can help you: flied BSSID report to which Subnet
you belong to, if it is null you can receive data from no one cards. 
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Lucent Wavelan I, II, Orinoco products and Cabletron </A>
</H2>

<P>Network type: DSSS, Adhoc and Infrastructure. 
<P>Lucent products are very professional ones. 
<P>Web site: 
<A HREF="http://www.lucent.com">http://www.lucent.com</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.orinoco.net">http://www.orinoco.net</A>. 
<P>Setup is like WebGear-like: step 1,2,3 are similar 
<P>Then you have to add to file /etc/pcmcia/config.opts: module &quot;wavelan_cs&quot;
opts &quot; ...&quot; for Lucent Wavelan I module and &quot;wavelan2_cs&quot;
opts &quot; ...&quot;, for Lucent Wavelan II or Orinoco. 
<P>Under opts you will specify: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>port_type=x, where x indicates Adhoc(3) or Infrastructure(1) </LI>
<LI>channel=x, x=channel, option relevant for AdHoc mode only. </LI>
<LI>transmit_rate=x, to fix the speed rate: attention to this setting for compatibility
with Cabletron cards. </LI>
</OL>
<P>Note: Ideally, it is possible in a Linux Box to have 2 Lucent Wavelanx
cards, one in Adhoc mode and the other in Infrastructure mode. Only one of
them could properly works because, when starting pcmcia service, all 2 cards
are set with same opts value (so in Adhoc or Infrastructure mode). So we have
to create a Linux module (or maybe a user mode program) that can change data_link
parameters at run-time such as access mode and channel used in Adhoc mode!
<P>
<P>The channel parameter is usually used to avoid interference with near other
Wireless TX/RX. 
<P>Lucent drivers could also be used for Cabletron cards 
<A HREF="http://www.cabletron.com">http://www.cabletron.com</A><H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 YDI </A>
</H2>

<P>Network type: DSSS, Adhoc and Infrastructure. 
<P>YDI sells very professional cards with antennas, amplifiers and more.

<P>
<PRE>
To install: 
</PRE>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>untar it in a empty directory.</LI>
<LI>type make for compile. </LI>
<LI>make install to install the driver am930_isa and the wlanctl utility</LI>
</OL>
<P>Once done you can choose if type manual commands using "wlanctl" data-link
utility or run the "scripts/wlan" file or "scripts/rc.wlan" file to automatically
config your network. 
<P>In manual case these are major settings: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>&quot;wlanctl scan ...&quot; to search for BSSs already present. </LI>
<LI>&quot;wlanctl netlist&quot; show you what's found with &quot;wlanctl scan
...&quot;. </LI>
<LI>&quot;wlanctl bsscreate ... ssid&quot; to create a new network with ssid
parameter. </LI>
<LI>&quot;wlanctl bssjoin bssid&quot; to join the network identified by bssid.
 </LI>
<LI>&quot;wlanctl authen&quot; and &quot;wlanctl assoc&quot; for authentication
services.</LI>
