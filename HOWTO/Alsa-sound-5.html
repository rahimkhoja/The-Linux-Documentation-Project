<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Loading the driver</A></H2>

<P>There are two ways to use the ALSA-sound-modules. I personally prefer using
the manual method, meaning that I insert the driver at startup. The ALSA-drivers
were designed as loadable/unloadable modules - for instance they do not
reset the mixer after loading - so you can easily use the kerneld approach.
<P>Please do read the section 
<A HREF="#backw-compat">Backwards Compatibility</A>.
You need it to have sound support ``the old way''.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Inserting with modprobe</A>
</H2>

<P>Note: If you have a PnP audio-card, you first need to set it to the right
(or at least some known) IO/IRQ/DMA. See the Plug-and-Play-HOWTO. Did
you configure your Plug-and-Play-soundcard? Ok, then read on please.
The main part is: do a "modprobe snd-card-&lt;soundcard>". This should do
the trick. Please note that not all distributions do include /sbin in your path.
If you get a "bash: modprobe: command not found", this will most
likely mean that modprobe is not in your path. Try ``/sbin/modprobe snd-card-sb16'',
or try to find the modprobe utility elsewhere.
<P>The most important difficulty is with the Crystal chipsets, for these
the ALSA-drivers are not auto probing. More recent information may be acquired
from the INSTALL file in the driver-directory. Two examples, then a list:
Gravis UltraSound (GUS) and compatibles:

However, if you have a 0.3.0-pre4 package, the GUS Classic driver is called ``snd-gusclassic'' and the

<A NAME="no-card"></A> 
For ALSA version 0.3.0-pre4, you need to leave out the ``card-'' part in most (not all!) of the drivernames.
So ``snd-card-sb16'' becomes ``snd-sb16'', however, ``snd-card-cs4232'' remains ``snd-card-cs4232''
(modprobe snd-cs4232 will do something, but it will not produce any sound!)
<P><B>(**)</B>
<A NAME="trident"></A> 
In older ALSA versions this driver was called ``snd-card-trid4wave'' and ``snd-trid4wave''.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 modprobe for drivers without auto-probing</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have a non-autoprobing driver, you need to supply additional info
at startup to have the driver work. More information can be found in the
file INSTALL in the driver directory.
<H3>OPL3-SA2 and OPL3-SA3</H3>

<P>According to the INSTALL file you need to supply all the information for
this driver. If you initialized the card with the isapnp-tools, you can
probably get info from the /etc/isapnp.conf file for the following values:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

snd_port - control port # for OPL3-SA chip
snd_wss_port - WSS port # for OPL3-SA chip (0x530,0xe80,0xf40,0x604)

You would do a "modprobe snd-card-opl3sa snd_port=0xNNN snd_wss_port=0x530 snd_midi_port=-1
snd_fm_port=0x388 snd_irq=5 snd_dma1=0 snd_dma1_size=NN snd_dma2=1 snd_dma2_size=NN"
to load this driver (without midi-support. I am still convinced that midi-support
is the thing you need when you have synthesizers and stuff and want to
connect them to your Linux box. Never needed Midi-support even to play
midi-files.)
<P>Note that the "NN" values need to be supplied, only I do not know what
would be reasonable values. I do not know if the dma size option is really required.
<P>If you happen to have an IBM Thinkpad with this chipset, then 
<A HREF="http://www.cirs.org/patrick/index.html">http://www.cirs.org/patrick/index.html</A> might be of help.
<P>If you use the driver from 0.3.0-pre4, then leave out the ``card-'' part in the name.
<P>
<H3>CS4231 chips</H3>

<P>According to the INSTALL file you need to supply the main port for this
card. Note that with the driver for 3235/6/7/8/9 cards, the one below,
I ended up supplying all information (except DMA-size), otherwise the driver did not work.
So you may as well use the whole command line to insert the driver. If
you initialized the card with the isapnp-tools, you can probably get info
from the /etc/isapnp.conf file for the following values:

soundcard. (Without midi-support, see the note at Yamaha OPL-3).
If you used different values in /etc/isapnp.conf, then
you would use the values here also (Note: it can be wise to use your brains
anyway ;)

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 The kerneld approach</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE>kerneld</CODE> is a daemon that inserts modules on request, and unloads them once
they are not in use anymore. Since I have no experience with kerneld, I
do not know if the information below is accurate. The info comes from the
INSTALL file in the ALSA-drivers package. Excellent information about kerneld
can be found in the kerneld-mini-HOWTO.
<P>Follow these steps:
<UL>
<LI>Edit your /etc/conf.modules (see below for examples)</LI>
<LI>Run 'modprobe snd-card' where card is name of your card [Which I find rather
strange, since kerneld is supposed to load them? VS]</LI>
