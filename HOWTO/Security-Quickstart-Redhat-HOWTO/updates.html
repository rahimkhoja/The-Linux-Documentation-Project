> OK, this section should be comparatively short, simple and straightforward
 compared to the above, but no less important.</P
><P
> The very first thing after a new install you should check 
  the errata notices at <A
HREF="http://redhat.com/errata/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://redhat.com/apps/errata/</A
>,
 and apply all relevant updates. Only a year old you say? That's a long
 time actually, and not current enough to be safe. Only a few months or few
 weeks? Check anyway. A day or two? Better safe than sorry. It is quite
 possible that security updates have been released during the pre-release
 phase of the development and release cycle. If you can't take this step,
 disable any publicly accessible services until you can.&#13;</P

> Linux distributions are not static entities. They are updated with new, 
 patched packages as the need arises. The updates are just as important 
 as the original installation. Even more so, since they are fixes. Sometimes
 these updates are bug fixes, but quite often they are security fixes because
 some hole has been discovered. Such <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"holes"</SPAN
> are
 <EM
>immediately</EM
> known to the cracker community, and they are
 quick to exploit them on a large scale. Once the hole is known, it is quite
 simple to get in through it, and there will be many out there looking for it.
 And Linux developers are also equally quick to provide fixes. Sometimes the
 same day as the hole has become known!&#13;</P
><P
> Keeping <EM
>all</EM
> installed packages current with your release 
 is one of the most important steps you can take in maintaining a secure
 system. It can not be emphasized enough that all installed packages should be
 kept updated -- not just the ones you use. If this is burdensome, consider
 uninstalling any unused packages. Actually this is a good idea anyway. &#13;</P
><P
> But where to get this information in a timely fashion? There are a number of
 web sites that offer the latest security news. There are also a number of
 mailing lists dedicated to this topic.   In fact, Red Hat has the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"watch"</SPAN
>
 list, just for this purpose at <A
HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/redhat-watch-list"
TARGET="_top"
>https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/redhat-watch-list</A
>. This is a very low 
 volume list by the way.  This is an excellent way to stay abreast of
 issues effecting your release, and is <EM
>highly
 recommended</EM
>. <A
HREF="http://linuxsecurity.com"
TARGET="_top"
>http://linuxsecurity.com</A
> is a good
 site for Linux only issues. They also have weekly newsletters available:
 <A
HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/general/newsletter.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxsecurity.com/general/newsletter.html</A
>.
 </P
><P
> 
  Red Hat also has the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>up2date</SPAN
> utility 
 for automatically keeping your system(s) up to date ;-). See the man page 
 for details.&#13;</P
><P
> This is not a one time process -- it is ongoing. It is important to stay 
 current. So watch those security notices. And subscribe to 
   that 
 security mailing list today! If you have cable modem, DSL, or other 
 full time connection, there is no excuse not to do this religiously. 
 All distributions make this easy enough!
 </P
><P
> One last note: any time a new package is installed, there is also a 
 chance that a new or revised configuration has been installed as well. 
 Which means that if this package is a server of some kind, it may be 
 enabled as a result of the update. This is bad manners, but it can 
 happen, so be sure to run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>netstat</SPAN
> or 
 comparable to verify your system is where you want it after any 
 updates or system changes. In fact, do it periodically even if there are no
 such changes.&#13;</P

><P
> It is very simple: make sure your Linux installation is current. Check 
   the Red Hat errata  
 for what updated packages may be available. There is nothing 
 wrong with running an older release, just so the packages in it are 
 updated according to what   Red Hat 
 has made available since the initial release. At least as long as 
   Red Hat  is still supporting
 the release and updates are still being provided.  For instance,
 Red Hat has stopped providing updates for 5.0 and 5.1, but still does for
 5.2.
