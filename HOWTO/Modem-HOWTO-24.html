<P> This section was adapted from Text-Terminal-HOWTO.</P>
<P>A terminal server is something like an intelligent switch that can
connect many modems (or terminals) to one or more computers.  It's
not a mechanical switch so it may change the speeds and protocols of
the streams of data that go thru it.  A number of companies make
terminal servers: Xyplex, Cisco, 3Com, Computone, Livingston, etc.
There are many different types and capabilities.  Another HOWTO is
needed to compare and describe them (including the possibility of
creating your own terminal server with a Linux PC).  Most are used for
modem connections rather than directly connected terminals.</P>
<P>One use for them is to connect many modems (or terminals) to a high
speed network which connects to host computers.  Of course the
terminal server must have the computing power and software to run
network protocols so it is in some ways like a computer.  The
terminal server may interact with the user and ask what computer to
connect to, etc. or it may connect without asking.  One may sometimes
send jobs to a printer thru a terminal server.</P>
<P>A PC today has enough computing power to act like a terminal server
except that each serial port should have its own hardware interrupt.
PC's only have a few spare interrupts for this purpose and since they
are hard-wired you can't create more by software.  A solution is to
use an advanced multiport serial card which has its own system of
interrupts (or on lower cost models, shares one of the PC's interrupts
between a number of ports).  See Serial-HOWTO for more info.  If such
a PC runs Linux with getty running on many serial ports it might be
thought of as a terminal server.  It is in effect a terminal server if
it's linked to other PC's over a network and if its job is mainly to
pass thru data and handle the serial port interrupts every 14 (or so)
bytes.  Software called "radius" is sometimes used.</P>
<P>Today real terminal servers serve more than just terminals.  They also
serve PC's which emulate terminals, and are sometimes connected to a
bank of modems connected to phone lines.  Some even include built-in
modems.  If a terminal (or PC emulating one) is connected directly to
a modem, the modem at the other end of the line could be connected to
a terminal server.  In some cases the terminal server by default
expects the callers to use PPP packets, something that real text
terminals don't generate.</P>
