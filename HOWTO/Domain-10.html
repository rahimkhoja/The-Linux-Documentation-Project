<P>This is a list of the meanings of some of the words and acronyms used
in this document.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>CGI Script</B><DD><P>A Common Gateway Interface Script. This is a program
which is run on demand to generate the content of a web page. If a web
page has to do more than simply feed an unchanging text and graphics
display to the viewer, you will probably need some sort of dynamic
content generation program such as a CGI Script. Examples include
discussion boards, feedback forms, e-commerce shopping carts, and
more.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-dhcp"></A> DHCP</B><DD><P>Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol. A standard, defined in RFC 1531, for computers on a TCP/IP
network to request from a central server information such as the IP
number they should be using, the netmask, the gateway, etc. Rather
than an administrator entering this information into the machine
configuration, the machine simply requests it from the server as it is
preparing to attach to the network.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-dns"></A> DNS</B><DD><P>Domain Name Service. A standard for
translating domain names into 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A>s, or vice versa, by looking up data in centralized databases.
<DT><B>DSL</B><DD><P>Digital Subscriber Line. A relatively high speed network
connection, usually delivered through specialized telephone wiring.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-dyn-ip"></A> Dynamic IP Number</B><DD><P>An 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A> which is assigned periodically
or on a per-session basis. No guarantee is made that the number will
remain constant. A dynamic IP number might change only when your
network connection hangs up and reconnects, or it might change
periodically under 
<A HREF="#glossary-dhcp">DHCP</A>
negotiation. Certain session-based services such as <EM>telnet</EM>
and <EM>ssh</EM> will stop working if the IP number of either end of
the connection is changed during the session.
<DT><B>Forward DNS Query</B><DD><P>A 
<A HREF="#glossary-dns">DNS</A> query
which converts a domain name into an 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A>.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-ftp"></A> FTP</B><DD><P>The File Transfer Protocol. A
standard system for sending files between machines over the Internet.
<DT><B>ftpd</B><DD><P>The daemon responsible for providing 
<A HREF="#glossary-ftp">FTP</A> services on a host. It responds to queries initiated by a
remote client.
<DT><B>Internet Service Provider</B><DD><P>See 
<A HREF="#glossary-isp">ISP</A>.
<DT><B>IP</B><DD><P>See 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A>.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-ip-num"></A> IP Number</B><DD><P>The ``address'' of a
certain network interface. Under the current addressing standard,
called ipv4, this number consists of four 8-bit values, generally
written as base-10 numbers separated by dots. Communication between
computers on the Internet is based on packets of information sent
between IP numbers.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-isp"></A> ISP</B><DD><P>Internet Service Provider. The
company which provides your network connectivity, including connection
hardware, service hosting, and leasing out the IP numbers under their
control.
<DT><B>Masquerading</B><DD><P>A form of filtering in which packets from one
machine to the outside world have their headers rewritten so that they
appear to come from an intermediate machine. That intermediate machine
then passes responses back to the originating machine. The net effect
is that an entire network of machines can appear to use a single IP
number, that of the masquerading host, for the purpose of outgoing
connections.
<DT><B>named</B><DD><P>The name server daemon. This is the daemon which answers
<A HREF="#glossary-dns">DNS</A> queries, and is distributed as part
of the BIND package.
<DT><B>Network Time Protocol</B><DD><P>See 
<A HREF="#glossary-ntp">NTP</A>.
<DT><B>
<A NAME="glossary-ntp"></A> NTP</B><DD><P>Network Time Protocol. A standard
for synchronizing your system clock with the ``true time'', defined as
the average of many high-accuracy clocks around the world.
<DT><B>OS</B><DD><P>Operating system. Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, BeOS, HP-UX, etc.
<DT><B>PHB</B><DD><P>
<A HREF="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/about/html/boss.html">Pointy-Haired Boss</A>. A creation of Scott Adams, of Dilbert
fame. 
<DT><B>Provider</B><DD><P>See 
<A HREF="#glossary-isp">ISP</A>.
<DT><B>Reverse DNS Query</B><DD><P>A 
<A HREF="#glossary-dns">DNS</A> query
which converts a 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A> into a domain name.
<DT><B>Router</B><DD><P>A specialized hardware device which implements rules for
where to send packets based on their 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A>s, and which bridges between your Ethernet hardware
and whatever communications medium connects you to your 
<A HREF="#glossary-isp">ISP</A>.
<DT><B>ssh</B><DD><P>The secure shell. A cryptographically strong replacement for
<EM>rlogin</EM>, <EM>telnet</EM>, <EM>ftp</EM>, and other programs.
Protects against ``spoofing'', man in the middle attacks, and packet
sniffing.
<DT><B>Static IP Number</B><DD><P>An 
<A HREF="#glossary-ip-num">IP Number</A>
which has been assigned or leased to you permanently. Barring
revocation of the agreement which granted you this number, that IP
number will always be available for your use, and no other machine on
the Internet is allowed to use that number. Contrast this with 
<A HREF="#glossary-dyn-ip">Dynamic IP Number</A>s.
