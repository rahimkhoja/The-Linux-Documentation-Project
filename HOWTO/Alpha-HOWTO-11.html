<P> All of the DS evaluation boards and motherboard designs are
license-free and the whole documentation kit for a design costs about
\$50. That includes all the schematics, programmable parts sources,
data sheets for CPU and support chipset. The doc kits are available
from Digital Semiconductor distributors. I'm not suggesting that many
people will want to rush out and buy this, but I do want to point out
that the information is available.
