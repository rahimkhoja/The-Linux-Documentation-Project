><P
>&#13;	A partition is labeled to host a certain kind of file system (not to
	be confused with a volume label (see <A
HREF="labels.html"
>Section 6</A
>)).
	Such a file system could be the linux standard ext2 file system or
	linux swap space, or even foreign file systems like (Microsoft) NTFS
	or (Sun) UFS. There is a numerical code associated with each
	partition type. For example, the code for ext2 is
	<TT
CLASS="literal"
>0x83</TT
> and linux swap is <TT
CLASS="literal"
>0x82</TT
>.
	To see a list of partition types and their codes, execute
	<TT

CLASS="command"
>/sbin/sfdisk</B

>3.2. Foreign Partition Types</H2
><P
>&#13;	The partition type codes have been arbitrarily chosen (you can't
	figure out what they should be) and they are particular to a given
	operating system. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that if
	you use two operating systems with the same hard drive, the same
	code might be used to designate two different partition types. OS/2
	marks its partitions with a 0x07 type and so does Windows NT's NTFS.
	MS-DOS allocates several type codes for its various flavors of FAT
	file systems: 0x01, 0x04 and 0x06 are known. DR-DOS used 0x81 to
	indicate protected FAT partitions, creating a type clash with
	Linux/Minix at that time, but neither Linux/Minix nor DR-DOS are
	widely used any more.

>3.3. Primary Partitions</H2
><P
>&#13;	The number of partitions on an Intel-based system was limited from
	the very beginning: The original partition table was installed as
	part of the boot sector and held space for only four partition
	entries.  These partitions are now called primary partitions.

>3.4. Logical Partitions</H2
><P
>&#13;	One primary partition of a hard drive may be subpartitioned. These
	are logical partitions. This effectively allows us to skirt the
	historical four partition limitation.
</P
><P
>&#13;	The primary partition used to house the logical partitions is called
	an extended partition and it has its own file system type (0x05).
	Unlike primary partitions, logical partitions must be contiguous.
	Each logical partition contains a pointer to the next logical
	partition, which implies that the number of logical partitions is
	unlimited. However, linux imposes limits on the total number of any
	type of partition on a drive, so this effectively limits the number
	of logical partitions. This is at most 15 partitions total on an
	SCSI disk and 63 total on an IDE disk.

>3.5. Swap Partitions</H2
><P
>&#13;	Every process running on your computer is allocated a number of
	blocks of RAM. These blocks are called pages. The set of in-memory
	pages which will be referenced by the processor in the very near
	future is called a "working set." Linux tries to predict these
	memory accesses (assuming that recently used pages will be used
	again in the near future) and keeps these pages in RAM if possible.
</P
><P
>&#13;	If you have too many processes running on a machine, the kernel will
	try to free up RAM by writing pages to disk. This is what swap space
	is for. It effectively increases the amount of memory you have
	available. However, disk I/O is about a hundred times slower than
	reading from and writing to RAM. Consider this emergency memory and
	not extra memory.
</P
><P
>&#13;	If memory becomes so scarce that the kernel pages out from the
	working set of one process in order to page in for another, the
	machine is said to be thrashing. Some readers might have
	inadvertenly experienced this: the hard drive is grinding away like
	crazy, but the computer is slow to the point of being unusable. Swap
	space is something you need to have, but it is no substitute for
	sufficient RAM.  See the discussion in  <A
HREF="requirements.html#SwapSize"
>Section 4.4</A
> for tips on determining the size of swap space
	you need.
