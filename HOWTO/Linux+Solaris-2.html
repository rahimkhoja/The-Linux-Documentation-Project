<H2><A NAME="harddrive"></A> <A NAME="s2">2. Preparing your Hard Drive</A></H2>

<P>To Prepare your hard-drive for Solaris, you need
to know about standard PC partition tables and
about Solaris disk slices. In this HOWTO I talk
about single-disk systems only, but all the
information should also apply to a multi-disk
environment. 
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Traditional PC partitions</A>
</H2>

<P>The standard partition-table has only 4 entries. The
entries important for us are the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>A Primary Partition</B><DD><P>Takes up one entry, and contains exactly one
partition. A waste of resources, but the only partition
you can boot from!
<DT><B>An extended Partition</B><DD><P>Takes up one entry, but can
contain multiple DOS, Linux, and other partitions
<DT><B>A Solaris Partition</B><DD><P>Takes up one entry,
but can contain multiple Solaris Partitions
</DL>

To find out what partitions are present on your system, use
the <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program. Partitions numbers 1 to 4
(<CODE>hda1</CODE>..<CODE>4</CODE>, <CODE>sda1</CODE>..<CODE>4</CODE>, ...) are the ones 
in your partition table.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Solaris partition labels</A>
</H2>

<P>Solaris has its own partitioning scheme. It
uses one entry in the partition table, and
this entry is and acts as this partition would
be the entire disk. 
<P>This virtual disk is then divided in up to 8 slices. The
third slice, s2, covers the whole virtual disk, so you
actually have up to 7 slices for Solaris.
<P>Unfortunately, the Solaris partition entry has the same
type as a Linux Swap partition (82). Therefore, you should
not have any Linux swap partitions as primary
partitions. Linux doesn't care about this, but who knows
what Solaris does?
<P>Although the Linux fdisk program has some ``Sun
disklabel'' support, this doesn't seem to help any.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Hard disk space</A>
</H2>

<P> Of course, Solaris needs disk space. The minimum
installation of Solaris 8 is about 300 MB. For the normal
tools its about 700 MB, and for a ``developer-system'' about
1 GB.
<P>But this is only the space required for the base
installation. You might want to add a lot of GNU-Tools, and
other stuff. And if you want to share data between Solaris
and Linux, this has to happen on the Solaris partitions.
<P>You might even think of sharing your home directories
between Solaris and Linux. As the time of this writing:
Forget it! I messed up my home directory doing so and I was
<EM>very</EM> happy about my backup. See also section
<A HREF="Linux+Solaris-6.html#sharing">sharing data</A><H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Quick check list</A>
</H2>

<P>Here's the quick check list. Make sure you:
<UL>
<LI>have used no more than 3 entries in your partition table</LI>
<LI>have no Linux swap partitions as primary partitions</LI>
<LI>Have at least 1 Linux ext2 partition as primary</LI>
<LI>Have at least 1 GB unpartitioned space</LI>
</UL>
