<H2><A NAME="perf"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. Performance Tips</A></H2>

<P>Here are some tips that you can use if you are suffering
from low ethernet throughput, or to gain a bit more
speed on those ftp transfers.
<P>The <CODE>ttcp.c</CODE> program is a good test for measuring
raw throughput speed. Another common trick is to do
a <CODE>ftp> get large_file /dev/null</CODE> where
<CODE>large_file</CODE> is &gt; 1MB and residing in the buffer
cache on the Tx'ing machine. (Do the `get' at least
twice, as the first time will be priming the buffer
cache on the Tx'ing machine.) You want the file in
the buffer cache because you are not interested in
combining the file access speed from the disk into
your measurement. Which is also why you send the
incoming data to <CODE>/dev/null</CODE> instead of onto
the disk.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 General Concepts</A>
</H2>

<P>Even an 8 bit card is able to receive back-to-back packets
without any problems. The difficulty arises when the computer
doesn't get the Rx'd packets off the card quick enough to
make room for more incoming packets. If the computer does not
quickly clear the card's memory of the packets already received,
the card will have no place to put the new packet.
<P>In this case
the card either drops the new packet, or writes over top of
a previously received packet. Either one seriously interrupts
the smooth flow of traffic by causing/requesting re-transmissions
and can seriously degrade performance by up to a factor of 5!
<P>Cards with more onboard memory are able to ``buffer'' more
packets, and thus can handle larger bursts of
back-to-back packets without dropping packets.
This in turn means that the card does not require as low
a latency from the the host computer with respect to pulling
the packets out of the buffer to avoid dropping packets.
<P>Most 8 bit cards have an 8kB buffer, and most 16 bit cards have
a 16kB buffer. Most Linux drivers will reserve 3kB of that
buffer (for two Tx buffers), leaving only 5kB of
receive space for an 8 bit card. This is room enough for
only three full sized (1500 bytes) ethernet packets.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 ISA Cards and ISA Bus Speed</A>
</H2>

<P>As mentioned above, if the packets are removed from the card
fast enough, then a drop/overrun condition won't occur even
when the amount of Rx packet buffer memory is small. The
factor that sets the rate at which packets are removed from
the card to the computer's memory is the speed of the data path
that joins the two -- that being the ISA bus speed. (If the
CPU is a dog-slow 386sx-16, then this will also play a role.)
<P>The recommended ISA bus clock is about 8MHz, but many
motherboards and peripheral devices can be run at higher
frequencies. The clock frequency for the ISA bus can usually
be set in the CMOS setup, by selecting a divisor of the
mainboard/CPU clock frequency. Some ISA and PCI/ISA
mainboards may not have this option, and so you are stuck
with the factory default.
<P>For example, here are some receive speeds as measured by
the TTCP program on a 40MHz 486, with an  8 bit WD8003EP
card, for different ISA bus speeds.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        ISA Bus Speed (MHz)     Rx TTCP (kB/s)
        -------------------     --------------
        6.7                     740
        13.4                    970
        20.0                    1030
        26.7                    1075
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>You would be hard pressed to do better than 1075kB/s with
<EM>any</EM> 10Mb/s ethernet card, using TCP/IP. However, don't expect
every system to work at fast ISA bus speeds. Most systems will
not function properly at speeds above 13MHz. (Also, some
PCI systems have the ISA bus speed fixed at 8MHz, so that
the end user does not have the option of increasing it.)
<P>In addition to faster transfer speeds, one will usually also
benefit from a reduction in CPU usage due to the shorter
duration memory and I/O cycles. (Note that hard disks and
video cards located on the ISA bus will also usually experience
a performance increase from an increased ISA bus speed.)
<P>Be sure to back up your data prior to experimenting with
ISA bus speeds in excess of 8MHz, and thouroughly test
that all ISA peripherals are operating properly after
making any speed increases.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Setting the TCP Rx Window</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Once again, cards with small amounts of onboard RAM and
relatively slow data paths between the card and the computer's
memory run into trouble. The default TCP Rx
window setting is 32kB, which means that a fast computer on
the same subnet as you can dump 32k of data on you without
stopping to see if you received any of it okay.
<P>Recent versions of the <CODE>route</CODE> command have the ability
to set the size of this window on the fly. Usually it is only
for the local net that this window must be reduced, as computers
that are behind a couple of routers or gateways are `buffered'
enough to not pose a problem. An example usage would be:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        route add &lt;whatever> ... window &lt;win_size>
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>where <CODE>win_size</CODE> is the size of the window you wish to
use (in bytes). An 8 bit 3c503 card on an ISA bus operating
at a speed of 8MHz or less would work well with a window
size of about 4kB. Too large a window will cause overruns
and dropped packets, and a drastic reduction in ethernet
throughput. You can check the operating status by doing
a <CODE>cat /proc/net/dev</CODE> which will display any
dropped or overrun conditions that occurred.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Increasing NFS performance</A>
</H2>

<P>Some people have found that using 8 bit
cards in NFS clients causes poorer than expected performance,
when using 8kB (native Sun) NFS packet size.
<P>The possible reason for this could be due to the difference
in on board buffer size between the 8 bit and the 16 bit cards.
The maximum ethernet packet size is about 1500 bytes. Now that
8kB NFS packet will arrive as about 6 back to back maximum size
ethernet packets. Both the 8 and 16 bit cards have no problem
Rx'ing back to back packets. The problem arises when the machine
doesn't remove the packets from the cards buffer in time, and the
buffer overflows. The fact that 8 bit cards take an extra ISA
bus cycle per transfer doesn't help either. What you <EM>can</EM> do
if you have an 8 bit card is either set the NFS transfer
size to 2kB (or even 1kB), or try increasing the ISA bus speed
in order to get the card's buffer cleared out faster.
I have found that an old WD8003E card at 8MHz (with no other
system load) can keep up with a large receive at 2kB NFS size,
but not at 4kB, where performance was degraded by a factor of three.
<P>On the other hand, if the default mount option is to use 1kB
size and you have at least a 16 bit ISA card, you may find
a significant increase in going to 4kB (or even 8kB).
