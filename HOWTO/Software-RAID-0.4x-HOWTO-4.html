<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
I have a RAID-1 (mirroring) setup, and lost power
while there was disk activity.  Now what do I do?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The redundancy of RAID levels is designed to protect against a 
<B>disk</B> failure, not against a <B>power</B> failure.

There are several ways to recover from this situation. 
        
<UL>
<LI>Method (1): Use the raid tools.  These can be used to sync
the raid arrays.  They do not fix file-system damage; after
the raid arrays are sync'ed, then the file-system still has
to be fixed with fsck.  Raid arrays can be checked with 
<CODE>ckraid /etc/raid1.conf</CODE> (for RAID-1, else, 
<CODE>/etc/raid5.conf</CODE>, etc.)
                
Calling <CODE>ckraid /etc/raid1.conf --fix</CODE> will pick one of the 
disks in the array (usually the first), and use that as the
master copy, and copy its blocks to the others in the mirror.
                
To designate which of the disks should be used as the master, 
you can use the <CODE>--force-source</CODE> flag: for example,
<CODE>ckraid /etc/raid1.conf --fix --force-source /dev/hdc3</CODE>
                
The ckraid command can be safely run without the <CODE>--fix</CODE> 
option 
to verify the inactive RAID array without making any changes. 
When you are comfortable with the proposed changes, supply 
the <CODE>--fix</CODE>  option.
           </LI>
<LI>Method (2): Paranoid, time-consuming, not much better than the
first way.  Lets assume a two-disk RAID-1 array, consisting of 
partitions <CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/hdc3</CODE>.  You can 
try the following:
<OL>
<LI><CODE>fsck /dev/hda3</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>fsck /dev/hdc3</CODE></LI>
<LI>decide which of the two partitions had fewer errors,
or were more easily recovered, or recovered the data
that you wanted.  Pick one, either one, to be your new
``master'' copy.  Say you picked <CODE>/dev/hdc3</CODE>. </LI>
<LI><CODE>dd if=/dev/hdc3 of=/dev/hda3</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>mkraid raid1.conf -f --only-superblock</CODE></LI>
</OL>


Instead of the last two steps, you can instead run 
<CODE>ckraid /etc/raid1.conf --fix --force-source /dev/hdc3</CODE>
which should be a bit faster.
</LI>
<LI>Method (3): Lazy man's version of above.  If you don't want to 
wait for long fsck's to complete, it is perfectly fine to skip 
the first three steps above, and move directly to the last 
two steps.  
Just be sure to run <CODE>fsck /dev/md0</CODE> after you are done.
Method (3) is actually just method (1) in disguise.</LI>
</UL>


In any case, the above steps will only sync up the raid arrays.
The file system probably needs fixing as well: for this, 
fsck needs to be run on the active, unmounted md device.

<P>With a three-disk RAID-1 array, there are more possibilities,
such as using two disks to ''vote'' a majority answer.  Tools
to automate this do not currently (September 97) exist.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
I have a RAID-4 or a RAID-5 (parity) setup, and lost power while 
there was disk activity.  Now what do I do?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The redundancy of RAID levels is designed to protect against a 
<B>disk</B> failure, not against a <B>power</B> failure.

Since the disks in a RAID-4 or RAID-5 array do not contain a file
system that fsck can read, there are fewer repair options.  You
cannot use fsck to do preliminary checking and/or repair; you must
use ckraid first.
        
<P>The <CODE>ckraid</CODE> command can be safely run without the 
<CODE>--fix</CODE> option 
to verify the inactive RAID array without making any changes. 
When you are comfortable with the proposed changes, supply 
the <CODE>--fix</CODE> option.
<P>
<P>If you wish, you can try designating one of the disks as a ''failed
disk''.  Do this with the <CODE>--suggest-failed-disk-mask</CODE> flag.  
<P>Only one bit should be set in the flag: RAID-5 cannot recover two 
failed disks.
The mask is a binary bit mask: thus:
<PRE>
    0x1 == first disk
    0x2 == second disk
    0x4 == third disk
    0x8 == fourth disk, etc.
            
</PRE>
<P>Alternately, you can choose to modify the parity sectors, by using
the <CODE>--suggest-fix-parity</CODE> flag.  This will recompute the 
parity from the other sectors.
<P>
<P>The flags <CODE>--suggest-failed-dsk-mask</CODE> and 
<CODE>--suggest-fix-parity</CODE>
can be safely used for verification. No changes are made if the
<CODE>--fix</CODE> flag is not specified.  Thus, you can experiment with
different possible repair schemes.
<P>

<LI><B>Q</B>:
My RAID-1 device, <CODE>/dev/md0</CODE> consists of two hard drive
partitions: <CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/hdc3</CODE>.
Recently, the disk with <CODE>/dev/hdc3</CODE> failed,
and was replaced with a new disk.  My best friend,
who doesn't understand RAID, said that the correct thing to do now
is to ''<CODE>dd if=/dev/hda3 of=/dev/hdc3</CODE>''.
I tried this, but things still don't work.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
You should keep your best friend away from you computer.  
Fortunately, no serious damage has been done.
You can recover from this by running:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mkraid raid1.conf -f --only-superblock
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

By using <CODE>dd</CODE>, two identical copies of the partition
were created. This is almost correct, except that the RAID-1
kernel extension expects the RAID superblocks to be different.
Thus, when you try to reactivate RAID, the software will notice
the problem, and deactivate one of the two partitions.
By re-creating the superblock, you should have a fully usable
system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
My version of <CODE>mkraid</CODE> doesn't have a 
<CODE>--only-superblock</CODE> flag.  What do I do?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The newer tools drop support for this flag, replacing it with
the <CODE>--force-resync</CODE> flag.  It has been reported
that the following sequence appears to work with the latest tools 
and software:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  umount /web (where /dev/md0 was mounted on)
  raidstop /dev/md0
  mkraid /dev/md0 --force-resync --really-force
  raidstart /dev/md0
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

After doing this, a <CODE>cat /proc/mdstat</CODE> should report
<CODE>resync in progress</CODE>, and one should be able to 
<CODE>mount /dev/md0</CODE> at this point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
My RAID-1 device, <CODE>/dev/md0</CODE> consists of two hard drive
partitions: <CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/hdc3</CODE>.
My best (girl?)friend, who doesn't understand RAID,
ran <CODE>fsck</CODE> on <CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE> while I wasn't looking,
and now the RAID won't work. What should I do?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
You should re-examine your concept of ``best friend''.
In general, <CODE>fsck</CODE> should never be run on the individual
partitions that compose a RAID array.
Assuming that neither of the partitions are/were heavily damaged,
no data loss has occurred, and the RAID-1 device can be recovered
as follows:
<OL>
<LI>make a backup of the file system on <CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>dd if=/dev/hda3 of=/dev/hdc3</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>mkraid raid1.conf -f --only-superblock</CODE></LI>
</OL>

This should leave you with a working disk mirror.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
Why does the above work as a recovery procedure?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Because each of the component partitions in a RAID-1 mirror 
is a perfectly valid copy of the file system.  In a pinch,
mirroring can be disabled, and one of the partitions
can be mounted and safely run as an ordinary, non-RAID
file system.  When you are ready to restart using RAID-1,
then unmount the partition, and follow the above 
instructions to restore the mirror.   Note that the above 
works ONLY for RAID-1, and not for any of the other levels.

<P>It may make you feel more comfortable to reverse the direction 
of the copy above: copy <B>from</B> the disk that was untouched
<B>to</B> the one that was.  Just be sure to fsck the final md.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
I am confused by the above questions, but am not yet bailing out.
Is it safe to run <CODE>fsck /dev/md0</CODE> ?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Yes, it is safe to run <CODE>fsck</CODE> on the <CODE>md</CODE> devices. 
In fact, this is the <B>only</B> safe place to run <CODE>fsck</CODE>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
If a disk is slowly failing, will it be obvious which one it is?
I am concerned that it won't be, and this confusion could lead to 
some dangerous decisions by a sysadmin.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Once a disk fails, an error code will be returned from
the low level driver to the RAID driver.
The RAID driver will mark it as ``bad'' in the RAID superblocks
of the ``good'' disks (so we will later know which mirrors are
good and which aren't), and continue RAID operation
on the remaining operational mirrors.

<P>This, of course, assumes that the disk and the low level driver
can detect a read/write error, and will not silently corrupt data,
for example. This is true of current drives
(error detection schemes are being used internally),
and is the basis of RAID operation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
What about hot-repair?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Work is underway to complete ``hot reconstruction''.
With this feature, one can add several ``spare'' disks to
the RAID set (be it level 1 or 4/5), and once a disk fails,
it will be reconstructed on one of the spare disks in run time,
without ever needing to shut down the array.

<P>However, to use this feature, the spare disk must have
been declared at boot time, or it must be hot-added,
which requires the use of special cabinets and connectors
that allow a disk to be added while the electrical power is
on.  
<P>
<P>As of October 97, there is a beta version of MD that
allows:
<UL>
<LI>RAID 1 and 5 reconstruction on spare drives</LI>
<LI>RAID-5 parity reconstruction after an unclean
shutdown</LI>
<LI>spare disk to be hot-added to an already running
RAID 1 or 4/5 array</LI>
</UL>

By default, automatic reconstruction is (Dec 97) currently
disabled by default, due to the preliminary nature of this
work.  It can be enabled by changing the value of 
<CODE>SUPPORT_RECONSTRUCTION</CODE> in
<CODE>include/linux/md.h</CODE>.  
<P>
<P>If spare drives were configured into the array when it
was created and kernel-based reconstruction is enabled, 
the spare drive will already contain a RAID superblock 
(written by <CODE>mkraid</CODE>), and the kernel will 
reconstruct its contents automatically (without needing
the usual <CODE>mdstop</CODE>, replace drive, <CODE>ckraid</CODE>,
<CODE>mdrun</CODE> steps).
<P>
<P>If you are not running automatic reconstruction, and have
not configured a hot-spare disk, the procedure described by
Gadi Oxman
&lt;
<A HREF="mailto:gadio@netvision.net.il">gadio@netvision.net.il</A>&gt;
is recommended:
<UL>
<LI>Currently, once the first disk is removed, the RAID set will be
running in degraded mode. To restore full operation mode,
you need to:
<UL>
<LI>stop the array (<CODE>mdstop /dev/md0</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>replace the failed drive</LI>
<LI>run <CODE>ckraid raid.conf</CODE> to reconstruct its contents</LI>
<LI>run the array again (<CODE>mdadd</CODE>, <CODE>mdrun</CODE>).</LI>
</UL>

At this point, the array will be running with all the drives,
and again protects against a failure of a single drive.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Currently, it is not possible to assign single hot-spare disk
to several arrays.   Each array requires it's own hot-spare.

<LI><B>Q</B>:
I would like to have an audible alarm for
``you schmuck, one disk in the mirror is down'',
so that the novice sysadmin knows that there is a problem.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The kernel is logging the event with a
``<CODE>KERN_ALERT</CODE>'' priority in syslog.
There are several software packages that will monitor the
syslog files, and beep the PC speaker, call a pager, send e-mail,
etc. automatically.

How do I run RAID-5 in degraded mode
(with one disk failed, and not yet replaced)?

Normally, to run a RAID-5 set of n drives you have to:

Even if one of the disks has failed,
you still have to <CODE>mdadd</CODE> it as you would in a normal setup.
(?? try using /dev/null in place of the failed disk ???
watch out)
Then,

The array will be active in degraded mode with (n - 1) drives.
If ``<CODE>mdrun</CODE>'' fails, the kernel has noticed an error
(for example, several faulty drives, or an unclean shutdown).
Use ``<CODE>dmesg</CODE>'' to display the kernel error messages from
``<CODE>mdrun</CODE>''.
If the raid-5 set is corrupted due to a power loss,
rather than a disk crash, one can try to recover by
creating a new RAID superblock:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mkraid -f --only-superblock raid5.conf
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

A RAID array doesn't provide protection against a power failure or 
a kernel crash, and can't guarantee correct recovery.
Rebuilding the superblock will simply cause the system to ignore
the condition by marking all the drives as ``OK'',
as if nothing happened.

How does RAID-5 work when a disk fails?

The typical operating scenario is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>A RAID-5 array is active.
</LI>
<LI>One drive fails while the array is active.
</LI>
<LI>The drive firmware and the low-level Linux disk/controller
drivers detect the failure and report an error code to the
MD driver.
</LI>
<LI>The MD driver continues to provide an error-free
<CODE>/dev/md0</CODE>
device to the higher levels of the kernel (with a performance
degradation) by using the remaining operational drives.
</LI>
<LI>The sysadmin can <CODE>umount /dev/md0</CODE> and 
<CODE>mdstop /dev/md0</CODE> as usual.

I just replaced a failed disk in a RAID-5 array.  After
rebuilding the array, <CODE>fsck</CODE> is reporting many, many
errors.  Is this normal?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
No. And, unless you ran fsck in "verify only; do not update"
mode, its quite possible that you have corrupted your data.
Unfortunately, a not-uncommon scenario is one of
accidentally changing the disk order in a RAID-5 array,
after replacing a hard drive.  Although the RAID superblock
stores the proper order, not all tools use this information.
In particular, the current version of <CODE>ckraid</CODE>
will use the information specified with the <CODE>-f</CODE>
flag (typically, the file <CODE>/etc/raid5.conf</CODE>)
instead of the data in the superblock.  If the specified 
order is incorrect, then the replaced disk will be
reconstructed incorrectly.   The symptom of this
kind of mistake seems to be heavy &amp; numerous <CODE>fsck</CODE>
errors.

<P>And, in case you are wondering, <B>yes</B>, someone lost 
<B>all</B> of their data by making this mistake.   Making
a tape backup of <B>all</B> data before reconfiguring a 
RAID array is <B>strongly recommended</B>.

The QuickStart says that <CODE>mdstop</CODE> is just to make sure that the

file systems enough?

The command <CODE>mdstop /dev/md0</CODE> will:
<UL>
<LI>mark it ''clean''. This allows us to detect unclean shutdowns, for
example due to a power failure or a kernel crash.
</LI>
<LI>sync the array. This is less important after unmounting a
filesystem, but is important if the <CODE>/dev/md0</CODE> is 
accessed directly rather than through a filesystem (for 
example, by <CODE>e2fsck</CODE>).</LI>
