Greg Hankin's  Serial-HOWTO v.1.11 (1997) section "How Do I Set Up A
Terminal Connected To My PC?" was incorporated into v1.00 at various
places (with Greg's permission).  v1.09 of Text-Terminal-HOWTO had
about 25 changes (and error corrections) suggested by Alessandro
Rubini.  For v1.26 I fixed about 25 typos, etc. found by Alain
Cochard.  Jeremy Spykerman told me about using a keyboardless terminal
as a console for a monitorless PC (using ttysnoop).  Numerous other
people have made a suggestion or two or found a few typos.  Thanks.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc1.2">Future Plans: You Can Help</A>
</H2>

<P>The author is looking for someone to take over maintaining this
howto.  Since real text terminals are pretty much obsolete, there is not
a lot of work to do except that links sometimes disappear and
automatically finding devices such a dumb terminals on a serial port may
not work right.  One project is to rewrite this howto oriented towards
text-terminal emulation with the command line interface.  Another
project would be to start with the brief overview of GUI terminals in
this HOWTO and create a new and up-to-date HOWTO on thin clients or the
like.</P>
<P>Please let me know of any errors in facts, opinions, logic,
spelling, grammar, clarity, links, etc.  But first, if the date is
over a couple of years old, check to see that you have the latest version.
Please send me any info that you think belongs in this document.</P>
<P>In order to fully utilize all the features of a certain real terminal,
one needs the terminal manuals that came with the terminal when it was
new.  If you don't have a manual, this HOWTO may be of some help.  One
way to have solved this problem would be for terminal manufacturers to
put their manuals on the Internet but they never did.  Except that Wyse
made available some of their user manuals and someone scanned old VT-100
manuals.  </P>

<P> New versions of the Text-Terminal-HOWTO should be released every
couple of years.  To get the latest version go to an LDP mirror sites (see:

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc1.5">Terminology Used in this Document</A>
</H2>

<P> Configuration means the same as set-up.  While Linux commands take
options (using - or -- symbols), options in a broader sense include
various other types of choices.  Install in the broad sense includes
setting up (configuring) software and hardware.  A statement that I
suspect is true (but may not be) ends with 2 question marks: ??  If
you know for sure, let me know.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc1.6">What is a Terminal ?</A>
</H2>

<P> A terminal consists of a screen and keyboard that one uses to
communicate remotely with a computer (the host).  One uses it almost
like it was a personal computer but the terminal is remote from its
host computer that it communicates with (on the other side of the room
or even on the other side of the world).  Programs execute on the host
computer but the results display on the terminal screen.  Originally
terminals were stand-alone devices with no computational ability and
thus they were once much cheaper in cost than computers.  They had no
pictures or audio, but could only display text and were thus called
"text terminals".  Today, the cost of PC computers is so low that one
may use a PC like a text terminal by running a software program to
make it behave like an old text terminal.  You formerly found real
text terminals at libraries and schools.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc1.7">Real Text Terminals</A>
</H2>

<P> In the olden days of mainframes, from the mid 1970's to the mid
1980's, most communication with large computers was done by people
sitting in front of real text-terminals.  And in the 1970's, before
the advent of personal computers, it was the only way to interactively
communicate with any computer.  These real text-terminals were neither
computers nor emulated text-terminals.  They consisted only of a
screen, keyboard, and only enough memory to store a screenfull or so
of text (a few kilobytes).  Users typed in programs, ran programs,
wrote documents, issued printing commands, etc.  A cable connected the
terminal to the computer (often indirectly).  It was called a terminal
since it was located at the terminal end of this cable.  Some
text-terminals were called "graphic" but the resolution was poor, the
speed slow, and little software was available to support such
graphics.</P>
<P>Today, real terminals are becoming rarities for most all computer
users.  But there is still some specialized uses for them as
point-of-sale devices and for access to mainframes and servers where
graphics and pictures are not needed.  However, if a text terminal is
needed people will sometimes use a personal computer to emulate a
terminal.</P>
<P>Almost everyone who uses Linux also uses terminal emulation.  When you are
not using an X Window GUI at a Linux PC, you are likely using a text
interface (virtual terminal).  It's also called a "command line
interface".  In X Window one can also get a command line interface
using one or more terminal windows by using an x-terminal-emulator
with names such as xterm, gnome-terminal, or konsole (KDE).  All these
use software to emulate a real terminal.  However in these cases, one
doesn't need most of the information provided by this HOWTO since such
emulation is automatically set up for the user.  However if one
emulates a terminal using a software program and then connects that
emulated terminal to another computer via a serial port cable, then
this HOWTO should be more useful (provided your PC has a serial port
on it --almost all recent PCs made after 2009 didn't have them anymore).</P>
<P>A real text-terminal is different from a monitor or
x-terminal-emulator because the simple character images that get
displayed on the text-terminal are stored right inside the terminal in
it's memory.  For a monitor or x-terminal-emulator, the images  are
stored in the video card of the PC and/or in the PC's memory itself.
The text-terminal's keyboard plugs into the terminal and is part
of the terminal while a PC's keyboard plugs into the computer.</P>
<P>For a monitor, the video images are sent by a short cable running from
the video card to the monitor while for a text-terminal there is a
bi-directional flow of character bytes in a long cable between the
computer's serial port and the PC it's connected to.  Most text
terminals do not have mice.</P>
<P>In network client-server terminology, one might think that a real
terminal is the client and that the host computer is the server.  The
terminal has been called a "thin client" by some.  But it is not
actually a "client" nor is the host a "server".  The only "service"
the host provides is to receive every letter typed at the keyboard and
react to this just like a computer would if you typed at its own
keyboard.  The terminal is like a "window" into the computer just like
a monitor (and keyboard) are.  You may have already used virtual
terminals in Linux (by pressing Left Alt-F2, etc.).  A real terminal
is just like running such a virtual terminal but you run it on its own
terminal screen instead of having to share the monitor screen.  In
contrast to using a virtual terminal at the console (monitor), this
allows another person to sit at another real terminal and use the same
computer simultaneously with others.  Such multi-user interfaces are
not "clients" and a server..</P>
