<H2><A NAME="s12">12. Configuring your Linux machine as a Novell Print Server.</A></H2>

<P>A program to allow your Linux machine to act as a print server on a Netware
network is included in the <EM>ncpfs</EM> package. For instructions on how to
obtain and build, it follow the directions in the `Netware client' section
above. Alternatively, support is included in the <EM>mars_nwe</EM> package.

<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 Prerequisites</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuration is quite straightforward but relies on you already having your
printer configuration completed and working under Linux. This is covered in
the 
<A HREF="Printing-HOWTO.html">Printing-HOWTO</A> in some depth.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>When you have a working printer configuration, and you have built and
installed the <EM>pserver</EM> utility then you need to add commands to start it
into your <CODE>rc</CODE> files.
<P>Exactly what command will use will depend on depend on exactly how you want
it to operate, but in its simplest form something like the following will
work:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# pserver -S ACCT_01 -U LASER -P secret -q LASERJET
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This example asks the <EM>pserver</EM> utility to login in to the <CODE>ACCT_01</CODE>
fileserver with username <CODE>LASER</CODE> and password <CODE>secret</CODE> and to take
jobs from the <CODE>LASERJET</CODE> print queue. When an incoming print job is received
it will use the default print command of <EM>lpr</EM> to feed the print job to the
Linux print daemon. The print queue must already be defined on the fileserver
and the username must have server priveliges for the queue.
<P>You could if you wished use any Linux command to accept and print the
print job. The <CODE>-c</CODE> argument allows you to specify the exact print command.
For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# pserver -S ACCT_01 -U LASER -P secret -q LASERJET -c "lpr -Plaserjet"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

would do exactly the same as the previous example except it would send the
job to the <CODE>laserjet</CODE> <EM>printcap</EM> configuration instead of the default
one.
