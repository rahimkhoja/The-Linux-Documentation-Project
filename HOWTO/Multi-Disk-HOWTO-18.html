Disk tuning and partition decisions are difficult to make, and there are no
hard rules here. Nevertheless it is a good idea to work more on this as the
payoffs can be considerable. Maximizing usage on one drive only while the
others are idle is unlikely to be optimal, watch the drive light, they are
not there just for decoration. For a properly set up system the lights should
look like Christmas in a disco. Linux offers software RAID but also support
for some hardware base SCSI RAID controllers. Check what is available. As
your system and experiences evolve you are likely to repartition and you
might look on this document again. Additions are always welcome.
<P>Finally I'd like to sum up my recommendations:
<UL>
<LI>Disks are cheap but the data they contain could be much more
valuable, use and test your backup system.</LI>
<LI>Work is also expensive, make sure you get large enough disks
as refitting new or repartitioning old disks takes time.</LI>
<LI>Think reliability, replace old disks before they fail.</LI>
<LI>Keep a paper copy of your setup, having it all on disk when
the machine is down will not help you much.</LI>
<LI>Start out with a simple design with a minimum of fancy technology
and rather fit it in later. In general adding is easier than replacing,
be it disks, technology or other features.</LI>

There are a few more important things that are about to appear here. In
particular I will add more example tables as I am about to set
up two fairly large and general systems, one at work and one at home. These
should give some general feeling on how a system can be set up for either
of these two purposes. Examples of smooth running existing systems are
also welcome.
<P>There is also a fair bit of work left to do on the various kinds of file
systems and utilities.
<P>There will be a big addition on drive technologies coming soon
as well as a more in depth description on using
<CODE>fdisk</CODE>, <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> and <CODE>sfdisk</CODE>.
The file systems will be beefed up as more features become available
as well as more on RAID and what directories can benefit from what
RAID level.
<P>
<P>There is some minor overlapping with
the Linux Filesystem Structure Standard and FHS
that I hope to integrate better soon, which will
probably mean a big reworking
of all the tables at the end of this document.
<P>As more people start reading this I should get some more
comments and feedback. I am also thinking of making a program
that can automate a fair bit of this decision making process
and although it is unlikely to be optimum it should provide
a simpler, more complete starting point.

<!--
disk!request for information
-->

It has taken a fair bit of time to write this document and although
most pieces are beginning to come together there are still some
information needed before we are out of the beta stage.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> More information on swap sizing policies is needed as well as
information on the largest swap size possible under the various kernel
versions.</LI>
<LI> How common is drive or file system corruption? So far I have
only heard of problems caused by flaky hardware.</LI>
<LI> References to speed and drives is needed.</LI>
<LI> Are any other Linux compatible RAID controllers available?</LI>
<LI> What relevant monitoring, management and maintenance
tools are available?</LI>
<LI> General references to information sources are needed, perhaps
this should be a separate document?</LI>
<LI> Usage of <CODE>/tmp</CODE> and <CODE>/var/tmp</CODE> has been hard to
determine, in fact what programs use which directory is not well defined
and more information here is required. Still, it seems at least clear
that these should reside on different physical drives in order to increase
paralellicity.</LI>

Now and then people post on comp.os.linux.*, looking for good project
ideas. Here I will list a few that comes to mind that are relevant to
this document. Plans about big projects such as new file systems should
still be posted in order to either find co-workers or see if someone is
already working on it.
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Planning tools</B><DD><P>that can automate the design process outlines
earlier would probably make a medium sized project, perhaps as an
exercise in constraint based programming.
<P>
<DT><B>Partitioning tools</B><DD><P>that take the output of the previously
mentioned program and format drives in parallel and apply the
appropriate symbolic links to the directory structure. It would
probably be best if this were integrated in existing system
installation software. The drive partitioning setup used in
Solaris is an example of what it can look like.
<P>
<DT><B>Surveillance tools</B><DD><P>that keep an eye on the partition sizes
and warn before a partition overflows.
<P>
<DT><B>Migration tools</B><DD><P>that safely lets you move old structures to
new (for instance RAID) systems. This could probably be done as a
shell script controlling a back up program and would be rather
simple. Still, be sure it is safe and that the changes can be undone.
