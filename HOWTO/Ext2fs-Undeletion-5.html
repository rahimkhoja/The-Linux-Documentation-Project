<P>Regardless of which method you choose, the first step is to unmount the
file system containing the deleted files.  I strongly discourage any urges
you may have to mess around on a mounted file system.  This step should be
performed <EM>as soon as possible</EM> after you realise that the files have
been deleted; the sooner you can unmount, the smaller the chance that your
data will be overwritten.
<P>The simplest method is as follows: assuming the deleted files were in the
<CODE>/usr</CODE> file system, say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# umount /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You may, however, want to keep some things in <CODE>/usr</CODE> available.  So
remount it read-only:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -o ro,remount /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If the deleted files were on the root partition, you'll need to add a <CODE>-n</CODE>
option to prevent mount from trying to write to <CODE>/etc/mtab</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -n -o ro,remount /
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regardless of all this, it is possible that there will be another process using
that file system (which will cause the unmount to fail with an error such as
`Resource busy').  There is a program which will send a signal to any process
using a given file or mount point: <CODE>fuser</CODE>.  Try this for the <CODE>/usr</CODE>
partition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -v -m /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This lists the processes involved.  Assuming none of them are vital, you
can say
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -k -v -m /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to send each process a <CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> (which is guaranteed to kill it), or for
example,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -k -TERM -v -m /usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to give each one a <CODE>SIGTERM</CODE> (which will normally make the process exit
cleanly).
