<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 ASUS and the NMI (Parity) -- impact on Gravis-Ultrasound</A>
</H2>

<P>The newer trition PCI-Mainboards in 1995 did not seem to
support parity-SIMMS anymore. Since I usualy took the cheaper
nonparity-SIMMS anyway, I did not consider this a problem until I put
the Gravis-Ultrasound into my machine. Under DOS the SBOS-Driver and
Setup/Test utility does complain about "nmi procedure disabled on this
p.c.". The manual says I'd better get a better mainboard in that case,
not very helpful.
<P>The gravis-ultrasound did work nice in the ASUS-SP3 and ASUS-SP4,
inspite of this, but the gravis-ultrasound-max I have here got
gmod to kernel panic on both boards, and sometimes when playing
au-files via /dev/audio did strange things, like playing the rest of
an older, previously played sound after the new one. The sounddriver
does recommend a buffer of 65536 with the GUS Max instead of the small
one like the GUS - why I do not know. I do not have such a problem
with the newer ASUS TP4 XE boards, though.
Both are equipped with 1M DRAM onboard. These problems are probably 
not related to the NMI-problem, but because of the sounddriver?
<P>I heard not only ASUS but most of the newer PCI-Mainboards are lacking
in parity/NMI-support.
<P>Strange enough - the ASUS-TP4 (Trition Chipset) does work with the GUS Max
- it does load the SBOS-Driver. I have to admit, I am confused.

<P>
<H3>ASUS SP3 with saturn chipset I (rev. 2) for 486, </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>    2 x rs232 with 16550</LI>
<LI>    NCR53c810 onboard, </LI>
<LI>    slightly broken saturn-chipset I (rev. 2)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>ASUS SP3G with saturn chipset II (rev. 4) for 486, </H3>

<P>like SP3, but less buggy saturn chipset
<P>
<H3>ASUS SP3-SiS chipset, for 486</H3>

<P>like AP4, but newer, SiS chipset, green functions and
all the EIDE, rs232 with 2 16550 and centronics.
Only 2 SIMM Slots,  Does seem to work with AMD486DX4/120, 
but was not very reliably on NCR53c810 and various operating
systems (Windows-NT, Windows95, OS2), after upgrading to a 
PentiumBoard ASUS SP4, all the problems vanished, so it must have 
been the board.  Still does seem to work nice for Linux, though.
<P>
<H3>ASUS AP4, for 486, with PCI/ISA/VesaLocalbus</H3>

<P>green functions, 1VL, 3 ISA, 4 PCI slots, only EIDE onboard,
no fd-controller, no rs232/centronics. Very small size. 
<P>does recognice AMD486DX2/66 as DX4/100 only. This can be
corrected with soldering one pin (which?) to ground, but I would not
recommend a board like this anyway. 
<P>The one I tested was broken for OS2 and Linux, but people are
said to use it for both. 
<P>The VesaLocalbus-Slot is expected to be slower than the normal
vesa-localbus boards because of the PCI2VL bridge, but without penalty
to the PCI section. 
<P>
<H3>ASUS SP4-SiS, for Pentium90, PCI/ISA</H3>

<P>like SP3-SiS, but for Pentium90/100.
<P>
<H3>ASUS TP4 with Triton chipset and EDO-Support</H3>

<P>has the Triton-Chipset for better performance and supports
normal PS2-Simms as well as Fast-Page-Mode and EDO modules.
<P>
<H3>ASUS TP4XE with Triton chipset and additional SRAM/EDORAM support</H3>

<P>supports the new EDORAM and upcoming SRAM standards. At least
SRAM is said to considerabely increase performance. Did for some
reason not accept the 8M PS2-SIMMS working ok in ASUS SP4, after
changing them against others, bigger looking ones, (16 chips instead
of 8 if I remember right) it worked ok. Has been tested with P90 and
P100.
<P>
<H3>...and many others now.</H3>

<P>if you have new information on problems with them, please report.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Benchmarks on ASUS Mainboards</A>
</H2>

<P>I tried to compare the speed of CPUs in two ASUS Mainboards: for 486 I tested
the SP3 SiS (the one with one vesa-local-bus slot) and for 586 I tested the
ASUS TP4/XE, each with 16M RAM, always the same unloaded system with another CPU, 
with whetstone and dhrystone.
<P>I must admit, I have not read the benchmarks-faq yet, and will probably edit
the section a loot soon. If you have any comments, please mail me.
<P>I am especially confused about the amd486DX4/100 being faster on dhrystones
than the DX4/120 version? I did not see that kind of inconsistency on comparing
the P90 and P100. 
<P>Perhaps this was at fault: when I plugged in the amdDX4-100, I had
the board jumpered for DX2-66. While the BIOS did report it as an DX4-100,
the board might have used the wrong clockspeeds... but since DX2-66 uses
33Mhz * 2 and DX4 uses 33Mhz * 3, this would have been correct?
<P>The board running with DX4-120 is jumpered to 40Mhz * 3 = 120 Mhz.
<P>Another thing I wonder about is why the whetstones-result does
yield so even numbers on some machines?

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Detailed information on the old ASUS PCI-I-SP3 with saturn chipset from heinrich@zsv.gmd.de: </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 3 PCI, 4 ISA Slots (3x16, 1x8 Bit)</LI>
<LI> ZIF Socket for the CPU</LI>
<LI> room for 4 72pin-SIMMs (max. 128M)</LI>

<LI> Onboard: NCR-SCSI, 1par, 2ser (with FIFO), AT-Bus, Floppy       </LI>
</UL>
<P>The board does like most in that price class -- write-through cache,
no write-back. This should not be significant, maybe 3% of performance.
<P>The BIOS supports scsi-drives under DOS/Windows without additional
drivers, but with the board come additional drivers which are said to
give better performance, for DOS/Windows(ASPI), OS2, Windows-NT,
SCO-Unix, Netware (3.11 and 4, if interpreted correctly)
<P>Gert Doering (gert@greenie.muc.de) was saying the SCO-Unix-driver for
the onboard-SCSI-Chip was not working properly. After two or three
times doing: "time dd if=/dev/rhd20 of=/dev/null bs=100k count=500"
it kernel-paniced...                            
<P>The trouble some people experienced with this board might be due to them
using an outboard Adaptec-SCSI-Controller with "sync negotiation" turned
on. (This predates the NCR driver release; hence the use of the
Adaptec.) Please check that in the BIOS-Setup of the Adaptec-1542C if
you use one and have problems with occasional hangups!
<P>There is a new version of the ASUS-Board which should have definitely
less problems. It is called ASUS-PCI-I/SP3G, the G is important. It
has the new Saturn-chipset rev. 4 and the bugs should be gone.
They use the Saturn-ZX-variant and the new SP3G has fully PCI
conforming level-triggered (thus shareable), BIOS-configurable interrupts.
It has an on-board PS/2-mouseport, EPA-power-saving-modes and DX4-support,
too. It performs excellently. If you can get the German computer magazine
C't from July (?), you will find a test report where the ASUS-Board is the
best around. 
<P>Latest information about ASUS-SP3-G: You might experience crashes when
using PCI-to-Memory-Posting. If you disable this, all works
perfect. jw@peanuts.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de said he believed it
to be a problem of the current Linux-kernel  rather than the hardware,
because part of the system still works when crashing, looking like a
deadlock in the swapper, and OS2/DOS/WINDOZE don't crash at all.
<P>Someone else with a very old ASUS-SP3 (saturn-I chipset) reported crashes
with using XFree86, which went away when he installed the very latest 
betaversion which seems to work around a bit of the problems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Pat Dowler (dowler@pt1B1106.FSH.UVic.CA) with ASUS SP3G</A>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> ASUS SP3G board (it is rev.4 == saturn II)</LI>
<LI> AMD DX4-100 CPU (need to set jumper 36 to 1&amp;2 rather than 2&amp;3,
otherwise it's set the same as other 486DXn chips)</LI>

<P>Unlike some other reports, I find the mouse pointer moves very smoothy
under X (just like the ol' 386)  - it is jumpy under some, but not all,
DOS games though...
<P>Performance is great!! I ran some large floating point tests and found
the performance in 3x33 (100MHz) mode to be almost 1.5x that in 2x (66MHz)
mode (large being 500x500 doubles - 4meg or so)... I was a little dubious
about clock-tripling but I seem to be getting full benefit :-)
<P>The heavily configurable energy star stuff doesn't work with the
current AMD DX4 chips - you need an SL chip
<P>I really need a SCSI disk and a PCI video card :-)
<P>(I had a phonecall by a person who had this problem with the buggy SMC FIFO
chipset, after using X-window they hung.)
