<P>The Linux console driver beeps the audible bell whenever a BEL char is
output (ASCII code 7).  Though this is a right choice for the default
behaviour, many users don't like their computer to beep. This
mini-Howto is meant to explain how to tell applications not to output
the BEL code. It also explain how to instruct the kernel and the X
Window System to avoid beeping when a BEL is output. Note that most of
this document refers to the text console, as configuring the X server
is an easy catch-all for any user who works in a graphic environment.
<P>In my opinion the best way to face a fussy computer is fixing the
hardware, and my own computer doesn't even carry a loudspeaker.
