<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Playing Various Sound Formats</A></H2>

<P>There are many kinds of sound formats (WAV, MIDI, MPEG etc.).
Below, we list the various formats and the applications that
can be used to play them.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 MIDI</A>
</H2>

<P>MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Device Interface.  MIDI
files usually have the extension <CODE>.mid</CODE>.  They contain
sequencing information, that is, information on when to play
what instrument in what way, etc.  Depending on your
hardware (and maybe the software you use to play them), the
sound might be awesome, or it might be downright crappy.
<P>
<P>
<H3>adagio</H3>

<P>This package includes <CODE>mp</CODE> (a command-line MIDI file
player) and <CODE>xmp</CODE> (an XView based MIDI file player, not
to be confused with the module player also called
<CODE>xmp</CODE>).  You will need the SlingShot extensions to use
<CODE>xmp</CODE>.  It also contains other programs for playing
Adagio scores.
<P>
<P>If you have a GUS, <CODE>mp</CODE> can also play MOD files (see
section 
<A HREF="#sec-modules">Modules</A> for more
information on modules).
<P>One little annoying bug (as of version 0.5 on some
hardware) is that the sound breaks at the end.  Namely,
instead of ending the sound the way the MIDI file
specifies, it ends by playing the note right before the
last one in a long interval.  It hasn't stopped me from
using <CODE>mp</CODE>, but it might prevent someone from using it
for `real' work.  It also starts up relatively slowly.
<P>The package does not mention any copyright (at least none
that I can find), so I assume it can be freely
redistributed and modified.  (By a strict interpretation
of copyright law, nothing gives one the right to do these
things, but I somehow doubt that this was the intention of
the author.)
<P>It is a port of the CMU MIDI Toolkit to Linux (though
there was enough added to make this questionable) by Greg
Lee (<CODE>lee@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/sound/adagio05.tar.gz">ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/sound/adagio05.tar.gz</A>.
The binaries included here are in a.out format (linked
with ancient libraries), and the <CODE>xmp</CODE> binary segfaults
in a X11R6 environment (XFree86 3.1.1, libc 4.7.2).  The
<CODE>mp</CODE> binary works fine in an <CODE>a.out</CODE> environment.
<P>You will need a bit of hackery to compile it.  Actually,
it's not much of a hackery.  All you have to do is to
include the <CODE>-lfl</CODE> switch at the end of <CODE>SHROBJ</CODE> and
<CODE>XMPOBJ</CODE> in the Makefile.  This is to link in the
<CODE>flex</CODE> library, which is not linked in by default.
Then follow the installation instructions.  And don't
forget to have XView and the SlingShot extensions
installed if you want to compile <CODE>xmp</CODE>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>TiMidity</H3>

<P>Some people recommend this <EM>experimental</EM> program
because of good sound quality (which is very true, it's
much better than <CODE>mp</CODE> on a Sound Blaster 16, though it
probably won't be much different on soundcards with
wavetable synthesis like the GUS).  However, it suffers
from high CPU loads.  It plays MIDI by first converting
MIDI to WAV and then plays the WAV (you can also convert a
MIDI file to a WAV file without playing if you want).
This is the reason for its CPU intensive nature.
<P>It also has an optional ncurses, SLang, Tcl/Tk or Motif
interface.
<P>You need Gravis Ultrasound patch files to use this.  Look
into the FAQ included with TiMidity for more information.
<P>The author is Tuukka Toivonen (<CODE>tt@cgs.fi</CODE>).
<P>The latest version of TiMidity can be found at the 
<A HREF="http://www.cgs.fi/~tt/timidity/">TiMidity home page</A>.  This page
also contains a link to a small library of GUS patches.
<P>
<P>
<H3>playmidi</H3>

<P>This is a MIDI player that plays to FM, GUS, and external
MIDI.  It is supposed to have a faster startup time
compared to other MIDI players.  It is also able to play
Creative Music Files, Microsoft RIFF files, and large MIDI
archives from games such as Ultima 7.
<P>It has an X interface and a SVGA interface.  It also has
an option for real time playback with tracking all the
notes on each channel and the current playback clock
(included automatically with <CODE>xplaymidi</CODE> and
<CODE>splaymidi</CODE>).
<P>You should do something like
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ splaymidi foo.mid; stty sane
              
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>if you are going to use the SVGA interface, since it
doesn't reset the terminal tty mode properly.  The SVGA
interface may be removed in the near future.
<P>It was written by Nathan Laredo
(<CODE>laredo@gnu.org</CODE> or <CODE>laredo@ix.netcom.com</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/playmidi-2.3.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/playmidi-2.3.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sec-modules"></A> <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Modules</A>
</H2>

<P>Modules (in computer music) are digital music files, made up
of a set of samples and sequencing information, telling the
player when to play which sample (instrument) on which track
at what pitch, optionally performing an effect, like vibrato
for example.
<P>An advantage it has over MIDI is that it can include almost
any kind of sound (including human voices).  Another is that
it sounds just about the same on any platform, because the
samples are in the module.  A disadvantage it has is that it
has a much larger file size compared to MIDI.  Another one
is that it has no real standard format (the only `real' one
is the ProTracker, which many modules aren't quite
compatible with).  It originated on the Amiga.
<P>The most common format has the extension <CODE>.mod</CODE>.  There
are many other extensions depending on what format they are
in.
<P>
<P>
<H3>tracker</H3>

<P>This very portable program (it has been ported to many
platforms) plays Soundtracker and Protracker music
modules.  It uses 16 bit stereo output, and I consider the
quality to be very good.  If you need a simple way to
reduce CPU load use the <CODE>-mono</CODE> option.
<P>This is a giftware program (quoting the author).  It is by
Marc Espie (<CODE>Marc.Espie@ens.fr</CODE>).
<P>A version of this with the Makefile already tweaked for
Linux can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/tracker-4.3-linux.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/tracker-4.3-linux.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>gmod</H3>

<P>This is a music module player for the Gravis Ultrasound
card.  4/6/8 channel MOD, 8 channel 669, MultiTracker
(MTM), UltraTracker (ULT), FastTracker (XM), and
ScreamTracker III (S3M) are the supported formats.
<P>It requires a version 3.0 or later sound driver.  And a
GUS, of course.  You may need to modify the kernel to make
volume control work the way you want.
<P>This has an X interface.  It uses the QT toolkit (needs
version 0.99 or greater).  Check the 
<A HREF="http://www.troll.no/">QT toolkit homepage</A> for information on
QT.
<P>This can be freely distributed.  It was originally written
by Hannu Savolainen, and now maintained by Andrew
J. Robinson (<CODE>robinson@cnj.digex.net</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/gmod-3.1.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/gmod-3.1.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>MikMod</H3>

<P>This portable module player plays XM, ULT, STM, S3M, MTM,
MOD and UNI formats.  (The UNI format is an internal
format used by MikMod.)  It has support for zipped module
files.  It uses 16 bit stereo for the sound output.  Use
the <CODE>-m</CODE> option (for mono output) if you need a simple
way to lower the CPU load.
<P>The Unix version can either use ncurses or Tcl/Tk for its
interface.  It can also be used as a library, not just an
independent program.
<P>It was originally written by Jean-Paul Mikkers
(<CODE>mikmak@via.nl</CODE>).  It is now maintained by Jake Stine
(<CODE>dracoirs@epix.net</CODE>).  This is shareware that has to
be registered if you want to use it commercially.  You
also need permission to redistribute it commercially
(non-commercial redistribution does not need such
permission).
<P>This can be found at the 
<A HREF="http://www.freenet.tlh.fl.us/~amstpi/mikmod.html">MikMod home page</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>xmp</H3>

<P>This is a module player (not to be confused with Adagio's
<CODE>xmp</CODE>) which can play MOD, S3M, MTM, PTM, PTR, STM,
669, and XM modules (other formats are also supported, but
still experimental or incomplete).  If you have soundcards
with wavetable synthesis (GUS or SoundBlaster 32AWE), then
you can use this feature of the soundcard to lower the
load on the CPU.  It also supports compressed modules.
<P>An X frontend to <CODE>xmp</CODE> is also available.
<P>This was written by Claudio Matsuoka
(<CODE>claudio@pos.inf.ufpr.br</CODE>) and Hipolito Carraro Jr.
<P>This can found at the 
<A HREF="http://xmp.home.ml.org/">xmp home page</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>s3mod</H3>

<P>This plays 4/6/8 track MOD modules and Scream Tracker 3
modules.  It uses 8 bit mono output with a sampling rate
of 22000 Hz by default.  You can use the option <CODE>-s</CODE> to
enable stereo, <CODE>-b</CODE> to enable 16 bit output, and
<CODE>-f</CODE> to set the sampling frequency.  However, the sound
output is worse than tracker (some noise), so I recommend
using <CODE>tracker</CODE> instead of <CODE>s3mod</CODE> for playing
ordinary MOD files (unless you have an underpowered
machine).  It has a much smaller CPU load compared to
tracker.
<P>It is copyrighted by Daniel Marks and David Jeske
(<CODE>jeske@uiuc.edu</CODE>), but you can do anything you want
with it (except that you can't claim you wrote it).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/s3mod-v1.09.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/s3mod-v1.09.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>mod</H3>

<P>This <EM>beta</EM> program plays MODs (15/31-instrument, up to
32 voices), MTMs, ULTs and S3Ms on the Gravis Ultrasound
card.  It can also use packed modules if you have
<CODE>gzip</CODE>, <CODE>lharc</CODE>, <CODE>unzip</CODE>, and <CODE>unarj</CODE>
installed.  It cannot play Powerpacked modules or modules
packed with some Amiga composers ("PACK" signature).
<P>This requires at least version 3.0 of the sound driver.
It <EM>won't</EM> work with the 2.90-2 or earlier version of
the sound driver.  The text interface requires ncurses.
There is also an X interface included, which uses Tcl/Tk.
<P>It was written by Mikael Nordqvist (<CODE>mech@df.lth.se</CODE> or
<CODE>d91mn@efd.lth.se</CODE>).

<P>
<P>
<H3>nspmod</H3>

<P>This is an <EM>alpha</EM> module player which can play MTM,
S3M, and MOD modules.  It is intended to be a module
player for soundcards without a DSP (not to be confused
with what Creative Labs calls a DSP).  It has a CPU load
somewhat similar compared to <CODE>tracker</CODE>.
<P>
<P>It has a feature which lets modules loop if they want to.
The number of loops can be limited by the <CODE>-l</CODE> option.
It uses only 8 bit sound output (as of version 0.1).
<P>This was written by Toru Egashira
(<CODE>toru@jms.jeton.or.jp</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/nspmod-0.1.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/nspmod-0.1.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>yampmod</H3>

<P>This <EM>alpha</EM> program was designed to play 4-channel
modules using the minimum of CPU resources.  It was
<EM>not</EM> designed to produce high quality sound.  So the
only sound output it produces is 22 kHz mono output.
Also, the output isn't as clean as it should be,
reflecting its alpha status.
<P>It was written by David Groves
(<CODE>djg@djghome.demon.co.uk</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 MPEG audio streams</A>
</H2>

<P>MPEG is a standard specifying the coding of video and the
associated audio for digital storage.  MPEG is usually
associated with video, but the audio part of the standard
can be used separately.  The audio part of the MPEG standard
defines three layers, layer I, II, and III.  Players that
can decode higher layers can also decode lower layers
(e.g. layer III players can play layer II files).  Layer I
MPEG audio files usually have the extension <CODE>.mpg</CODE> (so if
there is a file with this extension that can't be played by
a MPEG video player, it's probably an audio stream), layer
II usually have the extension <CODE>.mp2</CODE>, and layer III
usually have the extension <CODE>.mp3</CODE>.  The audio compression
is pretty good.  A two megabyte layer II MPEG audio file
will probably take up 25 megabytes for a raw PCM sample file
with the same quality.
<P>
<P>
<H3>mpg123</H3>

<P>This <EM>beta</EM> program is an efficient MPEG audio stream
player, which has support for layers I, II, and III.  It
is based on code from many sources.  It is able to play in
real time streams that are read by HTTP (i.e. one can play
an MPEG audio stream directly over the World Wide Web).
<P>The main author is Michael Hipp
(<CODE>Michael.Hipp@student.uni-tuebingen.de</CODE>).  It may be
used and distributed in unmodified form freely for
non-commercial purposes.  Inclusion in a collection of
free software (such as CD-ROM images of FTP servers) is
explicitly allowed.
<P>The latest version can be obtained from the 
<A HREF="http://mpg.123.org/">mpg123 homepage</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>maplay 1.2</H3>

<P>This MPEG audio stream player only has support for layer I
and layer II streams, and lacks support for layer III
streams.  It supports 16 bit sound cards on Linux.
<P>It is pretty CPU intensive, taking up to about 55% CPU
time on a 60MHz Pentium.  The output is intolerable on a
66MHz 486 because the CPU just can't catch up with the
sound.  If this happens to you, try playing only one side
of the audio stream (with the <CODE>-l</CODE> or <CODE>-r</CODE> option),
instead of the default stereo.
<P>A slight change in one of the files may be necessary in
order to compile it.  Namely, you may need to add the
following line to the beginning of the file
<CODE>configuration.sh</CODE>.

<P>
<H3>maplay 1.3b</H3>

<P>This is an unofficial modification (i.e. not by the
original author) of <CODE>maplay</CODE> 1.2, so that it can run
with a much lower load on the CPU.  It accomplishes this
mainly by making u-law output actually work on other
platforms besides the SPARC.  Note that it uses u-law
output by default, so the sound quality is lower.
<P>The modifications were made by Orlando Andico
(<CODE>orly@gibson.eee.upd.edu.ph</CODE>).

<P>
<P>
<H3>maplay3</H3>

<P>This is another derivative of <CODE>maplay</CODE> 1.2.  It adds
support for MPEG Layer 3 audio streams.  Currently it
seems to have some bugs in its playback (you may hear some
screeching noises).  You may have to twiddle with the
options to solve this.
<P>The modifications were made by Timo Jantunen
(<CODE>timo.jantunen@hut.fi</CODE> or <CODE>jeti@cc.hut.fi</CODE>).  It
says that it can be used freely, but making money off of
it is not allowed.  However, I'm not entirely sure about
the validity of this copyright, since the original
<CODE>maplay</CODE> is under the GNU General Public License, which
does not allow derivative works to have a different
copyright.

<P>
<H3>splay</H3>

<P>This <EM>beta</EM> player is another derivative of <CODE>maplay</CODE>
1.2 (actually, it is a derivative of <CODE>maplay</CODE> 1.2+,
which is a MS Windows only derivative of <CODE>maplay</CODE> 1.2).
It adds support for MPEG Layer 3 audio streams.  It is
also able to play WAV files.  It can also play audio
streams received over an HTTP connection.
<P>Another feature of <CODE>splay</CODE> is that it can be used as a
library (under the LGPL), so that it can be used in other
programs.  It also tries to improve performance by using
threading (you need <CODE>pthread</CODE> to use this feature) and
a little inline assembly.
<P><CODE>splay</CODE> uses a command line interface and an optional X 
interface (which uses QT).
<P>If after compiling it doesn't work (e.g. it segmentation
faults), try compiling it again without threading.
<P>This is by Jung Woo-jae (<CODE>jwj95@eve.kaist.ac.kr</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="http://adam.kaist.ac.kr/~jwj95/">splay's home page</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Sajber Jukebox</H3>

<P>This program is a MPEG audio player with a graphical user
interface.  It is based on <CODE>splay</CODE>, so it includes
support for MPEG audio layers up to III.  It is also able
to play MPEG audio streams in real time with the stream
being fed by HTTP.  It is also easy to configure.
<P>It uses the QT toolkit (at least version 1.2 is required).
It also uses the LinuxThreads library (the included binary
only works with version 0.5).
<P>The author is Joel Lindholm
(<CODE>wizball@kewl.campus.luth.se</CODE>).

<P>
<H3>amp</H3>

<P>This <EM>beta</EM> MPEG audio player only has support for MPEG
Layer 3 audio streams.  It is able to play directly to the
soundcard, and it can output to raw PCM or WAV files.
This also gives quite a load on the CPU (about 60% on a
133MHz Pentium).
<P>This was written by Tomislav Uzelac
(<CODE>tuzelac@rasip.fer.hr</CODE>).  It can be freely used and
distributed, as long as it is not sold commercially
without permission (including it in CD-ROMs that contain
free software is explicitly permitted, though).

<H3>XAudio</H3>

<P>This <EM>alpha</EM> library was written to be a fast
implementation of an MPEG audio decoding library to be
used by various GUI front-ends.  It supports MPEG audio
layers I, II, and III.  It is capable of random access to
bitstreams.  A command-line interface is included.  A
Motif (Lesstif) front-end is also included in the Linux
version.
<P>This is by Gilles Boccon-Gibod, Alain Jobart and others.
The front-ends to the libary can be freely downloaded.
The library itself must be licensed to be used (a source
and binary license is available).
<P>The front-ends to the library can be obtained from the
<A HREF="http://www.xaudio.com/">XAudio home page</A>.

<P>
<H3>Layer 3 Shareware Encoder/Decoder</H3>

<P>This is actually a converter that converts MPEG Layer 3
audio streams to WAV, AIFF, SND, AIFC, or just raw PCM
sample files.  The Linux version does not directly output
the sound to the soundcard.  One has to first convert it
to some other format.
<P>However, when you try to play a converted file using
<CODE>sox</CODE>, you'll probably just get noise because the word
order in the PCM samples is not right (at least on Intel
platforms).  You need to give <CODE>sox</CODE> the option <CODE>-x</CODE>
to solve this problem.  But there are some players that
don't have to be told that the word order is wrong, so you
might not have to worry about this.
<P>If you have a really fast computer (probably at least a
100Mhz Pentium), then you can try to play MPEG Layer 3
streams directly without having to first convert the audio
file to another format like in the following example (this
example assumes that you're using <CODE>sox</CODE> and playing a
44.1 kHz stereo sample).

<P>The number after <CODE>-r</CODE> is the sample rate of the audio
stream, and the number after <CODE>-c</CODE> depends on whether it
is mono or stereo (or even quad).  If this looks too
complicated, you can use something like a shell script or

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 WAV</A>
</H2>

<P>Quote from the <CODE>sox</CODE> man page:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These appear to be very similar to IFF files, but not the
same.  They are the native sound file format of Windows
3.1.  Obviously, Windows 3.1 is of such incredible
importance to the computer industry that it just had to
have its own sound file format.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These usually have the extension <CODE>.wav</CODE>.
<P>Also see section 
<A HREF="#sec-sox">sox</A> and 
<A HREF="#sec-bplay">bplay</A> for other WAV players besides
the ones listed here.
<P>
<P>
<H3>wavplay</H3>

<P>This program supports playing and recording with the WAV
format.  It uses locking so that only one sound may be
played at a time.  Its locking capabilities can also be
used separately from its sound playing capabilities.
<P>In addition to a command-line interface, it also has a
Motif interface, which can be used with Lesstif.
<P>It was originally written by Andre Fuechsel
(<CODE>af1@irz.inf.tu-dresden.de</CODE>), but was evolved to the
point of being completely rewritten by Warren W. Gay

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Other stuff</A>
</H2>

<P>This section lists stuff that play sound formats that don't
deserve a separate section (i.e. formats that have only one
player available), or players that play more than one
format.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sec-sox"></A> sox</H3>

<P>This program is actually a converter, that is, it converts
one sound format to another.  However, some versions of
<CODE>sox</CODE>, when invoked as <CODE>play</CODE>, plays the sound (the
<CODE>play</CODE> application in the Sound HOWTO probably refers
to this).  It supports raw (no header) binary and textual
data, IRCAM Sound Files, Sound Blaster <CODE>.voc</CODE>,
SPARC <CODE>.au</CODE> (w/header), Mac HCOM, PC/DOS <CODE>.sou</CODE>, Sndtool,
and Sounder, NeXT <CODE>.snd</CODE>, Windows 3.1 RIFF/WAV, Turtle
Beach <CODE>.smp</CODE>, CD-R, and Apple/SGI AIFF and 8SVX formats
<P>
<P>Since somewhere in the 1.3.6x kernels, you might have to
make a small change in one file to make it play the sound
directly.  Namely, you may have to change line 179 in
<CODE>sbdsp.c</CODE> from

<H3><A NAME="sec-bplay"></A> bplay</H3>

<P>This <EM>beta</EM> program plays raw audio, WAV, and VOC
files.  It's also able to record to these files.  It uses
a variety of techniques to get the highest speed possible
so that it can run acceptably even on slow machines.  One
of these techniques require that the installed programs be
setuid root.  The paranoid hoping to use this may want to
use the Debian package by Ian Jackson
(<CODE>ijackson@gnu.org</CODE>), which disables the feature
that needs the setuid bit.
<P>The author is David Monro (<CODE>davidm@gh.cs.usyd.edu.au</CODE>).

<H3>SIDPLAY</H3>

<P>This program emulates the Sound Interface Device
chip (MOS 6581, commonly called SID) and the Micro
Processor Unit (MOS 6510) of the Commodore 64.
Therefore it is able to load and execute C64 machine code
programs which produce music or sound.  In general these
are independent fragments of code and data which have been
ripped from games and demonstration programs and have been
transferred directly from the C64.
<P>It uses a command line interface by default.  There are
also Tk and QT interfaces available separately from the
main package.
<P>It is maintained by Michael Schwendt
(<CODE>sidplay@geocities.com</CODE>).

<H3>RealAudio Player</H3>

<P>This lets you listen to sound, which is stored in a
proprietary format, in real time over the Internet without
downloading the whole sound file first.  It could be used
stand alone, but it is really intended to be used along
with a web browser (the explicitly supported ones are
Mosaic and Netscape).  It cannot be used without X (you
wouldn't be able to get it working with Lynx in a text
console).
<P>However, there exists a hack which allows one to run the
RealAudio player from the text console.  It requires the X
virtual frame buffer (Xvfb) server to work.  This hack can
be obtained from

<H3>cat</H3>

<P>One might think what <CODE>cat</CODE>, the sometimes overused
concatenating utility, has to do with playing sounds.
I'll show a use of it through an example.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cat sample.voc > /dev/dsp
$ cat sample.wav > /dev/dsp
$ cat sample.au > /dev/audio
              
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Doing a <CODE>cat</CODE> of an <CODE>.au</CODE> file to
<CODE>/dev/audio</CODE> will usually work, and if you're lucky
enough that the file has the correct byte order (for your
platform) etc., a <CODE>cat</CODE> of a sound file that uses PCM
samples (like <CODE>.wav</CODE> or <CODE>.voc</CODE>) to <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE>
might even sound right.
<P>This isn't a totally useless use of <CODE>cat</CODE>.  It might be
useful, for example, if you have a sound file that none of
your programs recognize, and you know that it uses PCM
samples, then you might be able to get a very approximate
idea on how it sounds like this way (if you're lucky).
