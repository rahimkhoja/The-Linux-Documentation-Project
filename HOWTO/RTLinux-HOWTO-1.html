<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Purpose</A>
</H2>

<P>This document aims at getting the novice user up and running with RTLinux in as painless a
manner as possible.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Who should read this HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>This document is meant for all those who wish to know the working of a 
realtime kernel. For those of you already familiar with module programming,
the document wouldn't appear as a difficult one. And for others, you needn't
worry; since only the basic concepts of module programming are required,
which we would indeed discuss, as and when required.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Acknowledgement</A>
</H2>

<P>First of all I would like to thank my advisor, Pramode C. E, for his
encouragement and help. Also I express my sincere appreciation to Victor Yodaiken.
This document would not have been possible without all the information
gathered from different papers contributed by Victor Yodaiken. I am 
also grateful to Michael Barabanov for his thesis on "A Linux-base
Real-Time Operating System".   
<P>
