<P> You don't have to understand the basics to use the serial port But
understanding it may help to determine what is wrong if you run into
problems.  This section not only presents new topics but also repeats
some of what was said in the previous section 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-3.html#how_hdw_xfers">How the Hardware Transfers Bytes</A> but in greater detail.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.1">What is a Serial Port ?</A>
</H2>

<H3>Intro to Serial</H3>

<P> The UART serial port (or just "serial port for short" is an I/O (Input/Output) device.</P>
<P>An I/O device is just a way to get data into and out of a computer.
There are many types of I/O devices such as the older serial ports and
parallel ports, network cards, universal serial buses (USB), and
firewire etc.
Most pre-2007 PC's have a serial port or two (on older PC's).  Each
has a 9-pin connector (sometimes 25-pin) on the back of the computer.
Computer programs can send data (bytes) to the transmit pin (output)
and receive bytes from the receive pin (input).  The other pins are
for control purposes and ground.</P>
<P>The serial port is much more than just a connector.  It converts the
data from parallel to serial and changes the electrical representation
of the data.  Inside the computer, data bits flow in parallel (using
many wires at the same time).  Serial flow is a stream of bits over a
single wire (such as on the transmit or receive pin of the serial
connector).  For the serial port to create such a flow, it must
convert data from parallel (inside the computer) to serial on the
transmit pin (and conversely).</P>
<P>Most of the electronics of the serial port is found in a computer chip
(or a part of a chip) known as a UART.  For more details on UARTs
see the section
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-18.html#uart_">What Are UARTS?</A> But you may want to finish this section first so that you will
hopefully understand how the UART fits into the overall scheme of
things.</P>

<H3>Pins and Wires</H3>

<P> Old PC's used 25 pin connectors but only about 9 pins were
actually used so later on most connectors were only 9-pin.  Each of
the 9 pins usually connects to a wire.  Besides the two wires used for
transmitting and receiving data, another pin (wire) is signal ground.
The voltage on any wire is measured with respect to this ground.  Thus
the minimum number of wires to use for 2-way transmission of data is
3.  Except that it has been known to work with no signal ground wire
but with degraded performance and sometimes with errors.</P>
<P>There are still more wires which are for control purposes (signalling)
only and not for sending bytes.  All of these signals could have been
shared on a single wire, but instead, there is a separate dedicated
wire for every type of signal.  Some (or all) of these control wires
are called "modem control lines".  Modem control wires are either in
the asserted state (on) of +5 volts or in the negated state (off) of
-5 volts.  One of these wires is to signal the computer to stop
sending bytes out the serial port cable.  Conversely, another wire
signals the device attached to the serial port to stop sending bytes
to the computer.  If the attached device is a modem, other wires may
tell the modem to hang up the telephone line or tell the computer that
a connection has been made or that the telephone line is ringing
(someone is attempting to call in).  See section
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-19.html#pinout_">Pinout and Signals</A> for more details.</P>



<H3>RS-232  (EIA-232, etc.)</H3>

<P> The serial port (not the USB) is usually a RS-232-C, EIA-232-D, or
EIA-232-E.  These three are almost the same thing.  The original RS
(Recommended Standard) prefix officially became EIA (Electronics
Industries Association) and later EIA/TIA after EIA merged with TIA
(Telecommunications Industries Association).  The EIA-232 spec
provides also for synchronous (sync) communication but the hardware to
support sync is almost always missing on PC's.  The RS designation is
was intended to become obsolete but is still widely used and will be
used in this howto for RS-232.  Other documents may use the full
EIA/TIA designation, or just EIA or TIA.  For info on other
(non-RS-232) serial ports see the section 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-21.html#non_rs232">Other Serial Devices (not async RS-232)</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.2">IO Address &amp; IRQ</A>
</H2>

<P> Since the computer needs to communicate with each serial port, the
operating system must know that each serial port exists and where it
is (its I/O address).  It also needs to know which wire (IRQ number)
the serial port must use to request service from the computer's CPU.
It requests service by sending an interrupt voltage on this wire.
Thus every serial port device must store in its non-volatile memory
both its I/O address and its Interrupt ReQuest number: IRQ.  See 
<A HREF="#interrupt_">Interrupts</A>.  The PCI bus has its own system of
interrupts.  But since the PCI-aware BIOS sets up these PCI interrupts
to map to IRQs, it seemingly behaves just as described above.  Except
that sharing of PCI interrupts is allowed (2 or more devices may use
the same IRQ number).</P>
<P>I/O addresses are not the same as memory addresses.  When an I/O
addresses is put onto the computer's address bus, another wire is
energized.  This both tells main memory to ignore the address and
tells all devices which have I/O addresses (such as the serial port)
to listen to the address sent on the bus to see if it matches the
device's.  If the address matches, then the I/O device reads the data
on the data bus.</P>
<P>The I/O address of a certain device (such as ttyS2) will actually be a
range of addresses.  The lower address in this range is the base
address.  "address" usually means just the "base address".</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.3">Names: ttyS0, ttyS1, etc.</A>
</H2>

<P> The serial ports are named ttyS0, ttyS1, etc. (and usually
correspond respectively to COM1, COM2, etc. in DOS/Windows).  The /dev
directory has a special file for each port.  Type "ls /dev/ttyS*" to
see them.  Just because there may be (for example) a ttyS3 file,
doesn't necessarily mean that there exists a physical serial port
there.</P>
<P>Which one of these names (ttyS0, ttyS1, etc.) refers to which
physical serial port is determined as follows.  The serial driver
(software) maintains a table showing which I/O address corresponds to
which ttyS.  This mapping of names (such as ttyS1) to I/O addresses
(and IRQ's) may be both set and viewed by the "setserial" command.
See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-11.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A>.  This does
<CODE>not</CODE> set the I/O address and IRQ in the hardware itself (which is
set by jumpers or by plug-and-play software).  Thus which physical port
corresponds to say ttyS1 depends both on what the serial driver thinks
(per setserial) and what is set in the hardware.  If a mistake has
been made, the physical port may not correspond to any name (such as
ttyS2) and thus it can't be used.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-10.html#ttySN_">Serial Port Devices /dev/ttyS2, etc.</A> for more details.</P>

<H2><A NAME="interrupt_"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.4">Interrupts </A>
</H2>


<P>When the serial port receives a number of bytes (may be set to 1, 4,
8, or 14) into its FIFO buffer, it signals the CPU to fetch them by
sending an electrical signal known as an interrupt on a certain wire
normally used only by that port.  Thus the FIFO waits until it has
received a number of bytes and then issues an interrupt.</P>
<P>However, this interrupt will also be sent if there is an unexpected
delay while waiting for the next byte to arrive (known as a timeout).
Thus if the bytes are being received slowly (such as from someone
typing on a terminal keyboard) there may be an interrupt issued for
every byte received.  For some UART chips the rule is like this: If 4
bytes in a row could have been received in an interval of time, but
none of these 4 show up, then the port gives up waiting for more bytes
and issues an interrupt to fetch the bytes currently in the FIFO.  Of
course, if the FIFO is empty, no interrupt will be issued.</P>
<P>Each interrupt conductor (inside the computer) has a number (IRQ) and
the serial port must know which conductor to use to signal on.  For
example, ttyS0 normally uses IRQ number 4 known as IRQ4 (or IRQ 4).  A
list of them and more will be found in "man setserial" (search for
"Configuring Serial Ports").  Interrupts are issued whenever the
serial port needs to get the CPU's attention.  It's important to do
this in a timely manner since the buffer inside the serial port can
hold only 16 incoming bytes.  If the CPU fails to remove such received
bytes promptly, then there will not be any space left for any more
incoming bytes and the small buffer may overflow (overrun) resulting
in a loss of data bytes.</P>
<P>There is no 
<A HREF="#flow_control">Flow Control</A> to prevent this.</P>
<P>Interrupts are also issued when the serial port has just sent out all
of its bytes from its small transmit FIFO buffer out the external
cable.  It then has space for 16 more outgoing bytes.  The interrupt
is to notify the CPU of that fact so that it may put more bytes in the
small transmit buffer to be transmitted.  Also, when a modem control
line changes state, an interrupt is issued.</P>
<P>The buffers mentioned above are all hardware buffers.  The serial port
also has large buffers in main memory.  This will be explained later</P>
<P>Interrupts convey a lot of information but only indirectly.  The
interrupt itself just tells a chip called the interrupt controller
that a certain serial port needs attention.  The interrupt controller
then signals the CPU.  The CPU then runs a special program to service
the serial port.  That program is called an interrupt service routine
(part of the serial driver software).  It tries to find out what has
happened at the serial port and then deals with the problem such a
transferring bytes from (or to) the serial port's hardware buffer.
This program can easily find out what has happened since the serial
port has registers at IO addresses known to the serial driver
software.  These registers contain status information about the serial
port.  The software reads these registers and by inspecting the
contents, finds out what has happened and takes appropriate action.</P>





<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.5">Data Flow (Speeds)</A>
</H2>

<P> Data (bytes representing letters, pictures, etc.) flows into and
out of your serial port.  Flow rates (such as 56k (56000) bits/sec)
are (incorrectly) called "speed".  But almost everyone says "speed"
instead of "flow rate".</P>
<P>It's important to understand that the average speed is often less than
the specified speed.  Waits (or idle time) result in a lower average
speed.  These waits may include long waits of perhaps a second due to
<A HREF="#flow_control">Flow Control</A>.  At the other extreme
there may be very short waits (idle time) of several micro-seconds
between bytes.  If the device on the serial port (such as a modem)
can't accept the full serial port speed, then the average speed must
be reduced.</P>

<H2><A NAME="flow_control"></A> <A NAME="ss4.6">4.6</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.6">Flow Control </A>
</H2>

<P> Flow control means the ability to slow down the flow of bytes in a
wire.  For serial ports this means the ability to stop and then
restart the flow without any loss of bytes.  Flow control is needed
for modems and other hardware to allow a jump in instantaneous flow rates.</P>

<H3>Example of Flow Control</H3>

<P> For example, consider the case where you connect a 33.6k external
modem via a short cable to your serial port.  The modem sends and
receives bytes over the phone line at  33.6k bits per second (bps).
Assume it's not doing any data compression or error correction.  You
have set the serial port speed to 115,200 bits/sec (bps), and you are
sending data from your computer to the phone line.  Then the flow from
the your computer to your modem over the short cable is at 115.2k bps.
However the flow from your modem out the phone line is only 33.6k bps.
Since a faster flow (115.2k) is going into your modem than is coming
out of it, the modem is storing the excess flow (115.2k -33.6k = 81.6k
bps) in one of its buffers.  This buffer would soon overrun (run out
of free storage space) unless the high 115.2k flow is stopped.</P>
<P>But now flow control comes to the rescue.  When the modem's buffer is
almost full, the modem sends a stop signal to the serial port.  The
serial port passes on the stop signal on to the device driver and the
115.2k bps flow is halted.  Then the modem continues to send out data
at 33.6k bps drawing on the data it previous accumulated in its
buffer.  Since nothing is coming into this buffer, the number of bytes
in it starts to drop.  When almost no bytes are left in the buffer,
the modem sends a start signal to the serial port and the 115.2k flow
from the computer to the modem resumes.  In effect, flow control
creates an average flow rate in the short cable (in this case 33.6k)
which is significantly less than the "on" flow rate of 115.2k bps.
This is "start-stop" flow control.</P>
<P>In the above simple example it was assumed that the modem did no data
compression.  This could happen when the modem is sending a file
which is already compressed and can't be compressed further.  Now
let's consider the opposite extreme where the modem is compressing the
data with a high compression ratio.  In such a case the modem might
need an input flow rate of say 115.2k bps to provide an output (to the
phone line) of 33.6k bps (compressed data).  This compression ratio is
3.43 (115.2/33.6).   In this case the modem is able to compress the
115.2 bps PC-to-modem flow and send the same data (in compressed form)
out the phone line at 33.6bps.  There's no need for flow control here
so long as the compression ratio remains higher than 3.43.  But the
compression ratio varies from second to second and if it should drop
below 3.43, flow control will be needed </P>
<P>In the above example, the modem was an external modem.  But the same
situation exists (as of early 2003) for most internal modems.  There is
still a speed limit on the PC-to-modem speed even though this flow
doesn't take place over an external cable.  This makes the internal
modems compatible with the external modems.</P>
<P>In the above example of flow control, the flow was from the computer to
a modem.  But there is also flow control which is used for the
opposite direction of flow: from a modem (or other device) to a
computer.  Each direction of flow involves 3 buffers: 1. in the modem
2. in the UART chip (called FIFOs) and 3. in main memory managed by the
serial driver.  Flow control protects all buffers (except the FIFOs)
from overflowing.  </P>
<P>Under Linux, the small UART FIFO buffers are not protected by flow
control but instead rely on a fast response to the interrupts they
issue.  Some UART chips can be set to do hardware flow control to
protect their FIFOs but Linux (as of early 2003) doesn't seem to
support it.  FIFO stand for "First In, First Out" which is the way it
handles bytes in a queue.  All the 3 buffers use the FIFO rule but
only the one in the UART is named "FIFO".   This is the essence of flow
control but there are still some more details.</P>



<H3>Symptoms of No Flow Control</H3>

<P> Understanding flow-control theory can be of practical use.  The
symptom of no flow control is that chunks of data missing from files
sent without the benefit of flow control.  When overflow happens,
often hundreds or even thousands of bytes get lost, and all in
contiguous chunks.</P>

<H3>Hardware vs. Software Flow Control</H3>

<P> If feasible, it's best to use "hardware" flow control that uses two
dedicated "modem control" wires to send the "stop" and "start"
signals.  Hardware flow control at the serial port works like this:
The two pins, RTS (Request to send) and CTS (Clear to send) are used.
When the computer is ready to receive data it asserts RTS by putting a
positive voltage on the RTS pin (meaning "Request To Send to me").
When the computer is not able to receive any more bytes, it negates
RTS by putting a negative voltage on the pin saying: "stop sending to
me".  The RTS pin is connected by the serial cable to another pin on
the modem, printer, terminal, etc.  This other pin's only function is
to receive this signal.</P>
<P>For the case of a modem, this "other" pin will be the modem's RTS pin.
But for a printer, another PC, or a non-modem device, it's usually a
CTS pin so a "crossover" or "null modem" cable is required.  This
cable connects the CTS pin at one end with the RTS pin at the other
end (two wires since each end of the cable has a CTS pin).  For a
modem, a straight-thru cable is used.</P>
<P>For the opposite direction of flow a similar scheme is used.  For a
modem, the CTS pin is used to send the flow control signal to the CTS
pin on the PC.  For a non-modem, the RTS pin sends the signal.  Thus
modems and non-modems have the roles of their RTS and CTS pins
interchanged.  Some non-modems such as dumb terminals may use other
pins for flow control such as the DTR pin instead of RTS.</P>
<P>Software flow control uses the main receive and transmit data wires to
send the start and stop signals.  It uses the ASCII control characters
DC1 (start) and DC3 (stop) for this purpose.  They are just inserted
into the regular stream of data.  Software flow control is not only
slower in reacting but also does not allow the sending of binary data
unless special precautions are taken.  Since binary data will likely
contain DC1 and DC3 characters, special means must be taken to
distinguish between a DC3 that means a flow control stop and a DC3
that is part of the binary code.  Likewise for DC1.  </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.7">Data Flow Path; Buffers </A>
</H2>

<P>It's been mentioned that there are 3 buffers for each direction of
flow (3 pairs altogether): 16-byte FIFO buffers (in the UART), a pair
of larger buffers inside a device connected to the serial port (such
as a modem), and a pair of buffers (say 8k) in main memory.  When an
application program sends bytes to the serial port they first get
stashed in the transmit serial port buffer in main memory.  The other
member of this pair consists of a receive buffer for the opposite
direction of byte-flow.  Here's an example diagram for the case of
browsing the Internet with a browser.  Transmit data flow is left to
right while receive flow is right to left.  There is a separate buffer
for each direction of flow.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
application     8k-byte         16-byte        1k-byte        tele-     
BROWSER ------- MEMORY -------- FIFO --------- MODEM -------- phone
program         buffer          buffer         buffer         line
</PRE>
</P>
<P>For the transmit case, the serial device driver takes out say 15 bytes
from this transmit buffer (in main memory), one byte at a time and
puts them into the 16-byte transmit buffer in the serial UART for
transmission.  Once in that transmit buffer, there is no way to stop
them from being transmitted.  They are then transmitted to the
modem or (other device connected to the serial port) which also has a
fair sized (say 1k) buffer.  When the device driver (on orders from
flow control sent from the modem) stops the flow of outgoing bytes
from the computer, what it actually stops is the flow of outgoing
bytes from the large transmit buffer in main memory.  Even after this
has happened and the flow to the modem has stopped, an application
program may keep sending bytes to the 8k transmit buffer until it
becomes full.  At the same time, the bytes stored in the FIFO continue
to be sent out.  Bytes stored in the modem will continue to be sent
out the phone line unless the modem has gotten a modem-to-modem flow
control stop from the modem at the other end of the phone line.</P>
<P>When the memory buffer gets full, the application program can't send
any more bytes to it (a "write" statement in a C-program blocks) and
the application program temporarily stops running and waits until some
buffer space becomes available.  Thus a flow control "stop" is
ultimately able to stop the program that is sending the bytes.  Even
though this program stops, the computer does not necessarily stop
computing since it may switch to running other processes while it's
waiting at a flow control stop.</P>
<P>The above was a little oversimplified in three ways.  First, some UARTs
can do automatic hardware flow control which can stop the transmission
out of the FIFO buffers if needed (not yet supported by Linux).
Second, while an application process is waiting to write to the
transmit buffer, it could possibly perform other tasks.  Third, the
serial driver (located between the memory buffer and the FIFO) has
it's own small buffer (in main memory) used to process characters.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.8">Complex Flow Control Example</A>
</H2>

<P> For many situations, there is a transmit path involving several
links, each with its own flow control.  For example, I type at a
text-terminal connected to a PC and the PC (under my control) dials
out to another computer using a modem.  Today, a "text-terminal" is
likely to be just another PC emulating a text-terminal.  The main
(server) PC, in addition to serving my text-terminal, could also have
someone else sitting at it doing something else.  Note that calling
this PC a "server" is not technically correct but it does serve the
terminal.</P>
<P>The text-terminal uses a command-line interface with no graphical
display.  Every letter I type at the text-terminal goes over the
serial cable to my main PC and then over the phone line to the
computer that I've dialed out to.  To dial out, I've used the
communication software: "minicom" which runs on my PC.</P>
<P>This sounds like a simple data path.  I hit a key and the byte that
key generates flows over just two cables (besides the keyboard cable):
1. the cable from my text-terminal to my PC and 2. the telephone line
cable to some other computer.  Of course, the telephone cable is
actually a number of telephone system cables and includes switches
and electronics so that a single physical cable can transmit many
phone calls.  But I can think of it like one cable (or one link).</P>
<P>Now, let's count the number and type of electronic devices each
keystroke-byte has to pass thru.  The terminal-to-PC cable has a
serial port at each end.  The telephone cable has both a serial port
and a modem at each end.  This adds up to 4 serial ports and 2 modems.
Since each serial port has 2 buffers, and each modem one buffer, that
adds up to 10 buffers.  And that's just for one direction of flow.
Each byte also must pass thru the minicom software as well.</P>
<P>While there's just 2 cables in the above scenario, if external modems
were used there would be an additional cable between each modem and
it's serial port.  This makes 4 cables in all.  Even with internal
modems it's like there is a "virtual cable" between the modem and its
serial port.  On all these 4 links (or cables), flow control takes
place.</P>
<P>Now lets consider an example of the operation of flow control.
Consider the flow of bytes from the remote computer at the other end
of the phone line to the screen on the text-terminal that I'm sitting
at.  A real text-terminal has a limit to the speed at which bytes can
be displayed on its screen and issues a flow control "stop" from time
to time to slow down the flow.  This "stop" propagates in a direction
opposite to the flow of bytes it controls.  What happens when such a
"stop" is issued?  Let's consider a case where the "stop" waits long
enough before canceling it with a "start", so that it gets thru to
the remote computer at the other end of the phone line.  When it gets
there it will stop the program at the remote computer which is sending
out the bytes.</P>
<P>Let's trace out the flow of this "stop" (which may be "hardware" on
some links and "software" on others).  First, suppose I'm "capturing"
a long file from the remote computer which is being sent
simultaneously to both my text-terminal and to a file on my hard-disk.
The bytes are coming in faster than the terminal can handle them so it
sends a "stop" out its serial port to a serial port on my PC.  The
device driver detects it and stops sending bytes from the 8k PC serial
buffer (in main memory) to the terminal.  But minicom still keeps
sending out bytes for the terminal into this 8k buffer.</P>
<P>When this 8k transmit buffer (on the first serial port) is full,
minicom must stop writing to it.  Minicom stops and waits.  But this
also causes minicom to stop reading from the 8k receive buffer on the
2nd serial port connected to the modem.  Flow from the modem continues
until this 8k buffer too fills up and sends a different "stop" to the
modem.  Now the modem's buffer ceases to send to the serial port and
also fills up.  The modem (assuming error correction is enabled) sends
a "stop signal" to the other modem at the remote computer.  This modem
stops sending bytes out of its buffer and when its buffer gets full,
another stop signal is sent to the serial port of the remote computer.
At the remote computer, the 8-k (or whatever) buffer fills up and the
program at the remote computer can't write to it anymore and thus
temporarily halts.</P>
<P>Thus a stop signal from a text terminal has halted a program on a
remote computer computer.  What a long sequence of events!  Note
that the stop signal passed thru 4 serial ports, 2 modems, and one
application program (minicom).  Each serial port has 2 buffers (in one
direction of flow): the 8k one and the hardware 16-byte one.  The
application program may have a buffer in its C_code.  This adds up to
11 different buffers the data is passing thru.  Note that the small
serial hardware buffers do not participate directly in flow control.
Also note that the two buffers associated with the text-terminal's
serial port are going to be dumping their contents to the screen
during this flow control halt.  This leaves 9 other buffers that may
be getting filled up during the flow control halt.</P>
<P>If the terminal speed limitation is the bottleneck in the flow from
the remote computer to the terminal, then its flow control "stop" is
actually stopping the program that is sending from the remote computer
as explained above.  But you may ask: How can a "stop" last so long
that 9 buffers (some of them large) all get filled up?   It seldom
happens, but it can actually happen this way if all the buffers were
near their upper limits when the terminal sent out the "stop".</P>
<P>But if you were to run a simulation on this you would discover that it's
usually more complicated than this.  At an instant of time some links
are flowing and others are stopped (due to flow control).  A "stop"
from the terminal seldom propagates back to the remote computer neatly as
described above.  It may take a few "stops" from the terminal to
result in one "stop" at the remote computer, etc.  To understand what
is going on you really need to observe a simulation which can be done
for a simple case with coins on a table.  Use only a few buffers and
set the upper level for each buffer at only a few coins.</P>
<P>Does one really need to understand all this?  Well, understanding this
explained to me why capturing text from a remote computer was loosing
text.  The situation was exactly the above example but modem-to-modem
flow control was disabled.  Chunks of captured text that were supposed
to also get to my hard-disk never got there because of an overflow at
my modem buffer due to flow control "stops" from the terminal.  Even
though the remote computer had a flow path to the hard-disk without
bottlenecks, the same flow also went to a terminal which issued flow
control "stops" with disastrous results for the branch of the flow
going to a file on the hard-disk.  The flow to the hard-disk passed
thru my modem and since the overflow happened at the modem, bytes
intended for the hard-disk were lost.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.9">Serial Driver Module</A>
</H2>

<P> The device driver for the serial port is the software that
operates the serial port.  It is now provided as a serial module.
From kernel 2.2 on, this module will normally get loaded automatically
if it's needed.  In earlier kernels, you had to have <CODE>kerneld</CODE>
running in order to do auto-load modules on demand.  Otherwise the
serial module needed to be explicitly listed in /etc/modules.  Before
modules became popular with Linux, the serial driver was usually built
into the kernel (and sometimes still is).  If it's built-in don't let
the serial module load or else you will have two serial drivers
running at the same time.  With 2 drivers there are all sorts of
errors including a possible "I/O error" when attempting to open a
serial port.  Use "lsmod" to see if the module is loaded.</P>
<P>When the serial module is loaded it displays a message on the screen
about the existing serial ports (often showing a wrong IRQ).  But once
the module is used by <CODE>setserial</CODE> to tell the device driver the
(hopefully) correct IRQ then you should see a second display similar
to the first but with the correct IRQ, etc.  See
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-15.html#ser_module">Serial Module</A>
See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-11.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A> for more info on
<CODE>setserial</CODE>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.10">The Serial Port is Now Obsolete on PCs </A>
</H2>

<P> The serial port is
today (2011) sort of obsolete on PCs (and often called a "legacy"
device) but it is still in use on some older computers and is used in
imbedded systems, for communication with routers and point-of-sale
equipment, etc.  The serial port is 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-16.html#slow_">slow</A>
and after about 2005 most new PC's no longer had them.  Most laptops
and Macs discontinued them even earlier.  During the era when some new
PC's came with serial ports and others didn't, the PC's that didn't
have serial ports were euphemistically called "legacy-free".  However,
while PC's today no longer have serial ports, some do have them built
into a "legacy" modem (which plugs into a telephone line).  Such a serial port
only works with the modem and can't be used for any other device.  The
reason they have such a "built in" serial port is that analog modems
are designed to only work thru a serial port. </P>
<P>The physical serial port on the back of a PC (including the chip its
connected to inside the PC), must pass data between the computer and
an external cable.  Thus it has two interfaces: the serial-port-to
cable and the serial-port-to-computer-bus.  Both of these interfaces
are slow.  First we'll consider the interface via external cable to
the outside world.</P>

<H2><A NAME="slow_"></A> <A NAME="ss4.11">4.11</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.11">RS-232 Cable Is Low Speed &amp; Short Distance </A>
</H2>

<P> The conventional RS-232 serial port is inherently low speed and
is severely limited in distance.  Ads often read "high speed" but it
can only work at "high speed" over very short distances such as to a
modem located right next to the computer.  Compared to a network card,
even this "high speed" is actually low speed.  All of the RS-232
serial cable wires use a common ground return wire so that
twisted-pair technology (needed for high speeds) can't be used without
additional hardware.  More modern interfaces for serial ports exist
but they are not standard on PC's like the RS-232 is.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-21.html#non_232">Successors to RS-232</A>.  Some multiport serial
cards support them.</P>
<P>It is somewhat tragic that the RS-232 standard from 1969 did not use
twisted pair technology which could operate about a hundred times
faster.  Twisted pairs have been used in telephone cables since the
late 1800's.  In 1888 (over 120 years ago) the "Cable Conference"
reported its support of twisted-pair (for telephone systems) and
pointed out its advantages.  But over 80 years after this approval by
the "Cable Conference", RS-232 failed to utilize it.   Since RS-232
was originally designed for connecting a terminal to a low speed modem
located nearby, the need for high speed and longer distance
transmission was apparently not recognized.  The result was that since
the serial port couldn't handle high speeds, new types of serial
interfaces were devised that could: Ethernet, USB, Firewire, etc.
The final outcome was the demise of the serial port which due to it's
ancient technology became obsolete for high speed uses.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.12">4.12</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc4.12">Inefficient PCI Interface to the Computer (in some cases)</A>
</H2>

<P> The serial port communicates with the computer via the PCI bus,
the LPC bus, X-bus, or ISA bus.  The PCI bus is now 32 or 64 bits wide,
but the serial port only sends a byte at a time (8 bits wide) which is
a waste of PCI bus bandwidth.  Not so for the LPC bus which has only a
4-bit wide bus and thus provides an efficient interface.  The ISA bus
is usually 16-bits wide and the efficiency is intermediate as compared
to efficient LPC and inefficient PCI.</P>
