<P>LBX works by introducing a <EM>proxy server</EM> at the client side,
which performs caching and compression.  The X server knows that the
client is using a proxy server, and decompresses accordingly.
<P>Here's a normal setup for remote X clients.  In our discussion,
LOCAL is always the workstation sitting in front of you, whose monitor
you're looking at, and REMOTE is the remote workstation, where the
actual application is running.

<P>When using LBX, a proxy server (<CODE>lbxproxy</CODE>) is introduced on the
remote side, and the applications talk to that process instead of
directly to the LOCAL server.  That process then performs the caching
and compression of X requests and forwards them.  It looks like this:
