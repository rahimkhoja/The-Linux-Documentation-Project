>&#13;If you've got a Rockwell or Conexant chipset based modem and you can't seem to get the modem to work with Linux, then you've come to the right place. Chances are that you've got a Software modem (also known as a "winmodem") and you'll need a driver to get the modem working under Linux.&#13;</P

>&#13;If you've got a Software modem whose chipset is not made by Conexant or Rockwell then you should see the <A

>&#13;Note that this guide has no information about using Conexant/Rockwell modems for operating systems other then Linux except for the following: There are no known drivers for FreeBSD or BeOS, Windows drivers can be obtained from Conexant.&#13;</P

NAME="ABOUT">1.2. About the howto</H2
><P
>&#13;This HOWTO originally started out as a website about installing Conexant HSF modems under linux, but after several months of being online the number of hits on the website was rapidly growing (100 hits/day at time of writing this HOWTO) and so were the number of requests for information about Rockwell/Conexant modems that were being posted to the linmodem mailing list, usenet and various web based forums. This lead me to decide that the information needed another distribution medium which would be more accessible to users. The result of this was this HOWTO which has expanded to include a far larger range of information then the original website had, in order to cover all the questions being asked on the internet.</P
><P
> At the same time as the increase in demand for information about Rockwell/Conexant modems under linux a number of non-english webpages appeared explaining how to setup the drivers in languages as diverse as Portuguese and Japanese, these webpages often lacked all the current information which was available making it harder for users to get their modems to work. I decided to release this HOWTO under the GNU Free Documentation License, so that native speakers of other language can translate this document into their own language and redistribute it freely, thus ensuring that all users get all the information regardless of what language they speak. If you're interested in making a translation of this HOWTO please contact me.</P
><P
>&#13;The HOWTO assumes a basic knowledge of Linux, you should be familiar with the basics of how to use a console/terminal, how to use common commands like less and be familiar with a text editor.When the howto needs you to type something in at the console, the console prompt will look like this: '<TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[user@localhost]$ </TT
>'&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Some parts of the howto rely upon a greater knowledge of Linux, but those section will mainly apply if you have a non-standard Linux distribution. &#13;</P
