<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Linux Utilities for Jaz Drives</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 jaztool</A>
</H2>

<P>jaztool is a Linux utility written by Bob Willmot to support some of
the Jaz drive's features (including software controlled ejection and write
protection).  I like jaztool because its commands can be embedded in alias
commands and scripts.  It's also easy to compile and install.
<P>The original source code for jaztool can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.willmot.com/jaztool/">http://www.willmot.com/jaztool/</A> and is also mirrored at my site at
<A HREF="http://www.ultranet.com/~hsd/HOWTO/index.shtml#jaztool">http://www.ultranet.com/~hsd/HOWTO/index.shtml#jaztool</A><P>Note that to use jaztool with a 2Gb Jaz drive, you must change ONE line
of code.  Change line 188 from this:
<P><CODE>return(!strncasecmp(id,"IOMEGA  JAZ 1GB",15));</CODE>
<P>to this:
<P><CODE>return(!strncasecmp(id,"IOMEGA  JAZ",11));</CODE>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> There are <B>two spaces</B> between IOMEGA and JAZ in
the previous two lines of code.  SGML (or maybe just HTML) apparently
removes the extra whitespace.
<P>After building jaztool and installing it, it must be suid root, or run
as root, or it won't work.
<P>I use jaztool regularly, so if you have a question about it, I would be
happy to try and answer it.
<H3>Ejecting a Cartridge</H3>

<P>Use the following command to eject a cartridge:
<P><CODE>jaztool /dev/sda eject</CODE>
<P>This might seem like a lot to type, but it's easy to make a slick
alias like this:
<P><CODE>alias jazej 'umount /jaz; jaztool /dev/sda eject'</CODE>
<H3>Password Protection</H3>

<P>There are two password protection modes on a Jaz, and both are controlled
through software.  One is Write Protected and the other is Read/Write 
Protected.  jaztool will allow you to unlock a Write Protected disk, but
under Linux, a device that cannot be read cannot be mounted, so Read/Write
Protected is not supported.
<P>If the cartridge is Write Protected (such as a Jaz Tools disk), use the
following command to unlock it (the disk must not be mounted):
<P><CODE>jaztool /dev/sda rw</CODE>
<P>jaztool prompts for a password, and if the password is correct, the disk
is unlocked and ejected.  This must be done to cause the SCSI driver to
pick up the new mode when the cartridge is re-inserted.
<P>To make the disk Write Protected again, use the following command:
<P><CODE>jaztool /dev/sda ro</CODE>
<P>jaztool again prompts for a password, and the disk is locked and 
ejected.
<P>Note that jaztool doesn't support the "Unprotect until Eject" feature
found in the Windows world.  If you remove the password protection, it
is removed until you put it back on.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 jaZip</A>
</H2>

<P>If you'd prefer a nice, slick, graphical user interface to control
your Jaz (and Zip!) drive, there's the jaZip tool.  Check it out at:

questions on jaZip.  Contact information is on the website listed above.
