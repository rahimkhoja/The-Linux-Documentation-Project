<H2><A NAME="security"></A> <A NAME="s8">8. Securing Your Domain</A></H2>

<P>This section deals with setting up security for your new domain. The
emphasis is on user-transparent features. If your security is too
obtrusive, and interferes strongly with the actions of the users, the
users will develop their own workarounds which may compromise the
entire domain. The best way to avoid this is to make the security as
transparent as possible, and to encourage users to come to you first
when they have difficulties which might be related to the security
measures of the site. A certain flexibility in attitude is
important. I know from personal experience that if the security policy
is too rigid, the users will simply set up their own network tunnels
through the firewall so they can log in from outside the domain. It's
better that remote login procedures, or whatever the users are trying
to do, be set up, inspected, and approved by you.
<P>
<P>This section deals with securing your network against outside attack,
and against casual snooping from within. Securing your site against
determined attack from validated users within the private network is a
more difficult and involved task, and is beyond the scope of this
document.
<P>
<P>One of the security considerations used in this section is protecting
against the ``hostile router''. The router provided by your ISP may be
a remotely configurable computer in its own right, with the
administrative password held by your provider. There have been
security problems in the past when the router's manufacturer override
password (the one used when your ISP forgets the password they
programmed in) has become known to system crackers. When possible, you
should design your security around the assumption that the router is
potentially hostile. That is, it could be using any IP number in your
public <EM>or private</EM> network blocks, it could be redirecting
traffic on outgoing packets to another site, and it could be recording
anything which goes through.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="filtering"></A> <A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Configuring Your Firewall</A>
</H2>

<P>This section deals with configuring an <EM>ipchains</EM>-based
masquerading, forwarding, filtering router. You should probably read
the 
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO">IPCHAINS-HOWTO</A> document first, then look here for additional
hints. That HOWTO describes the steps necessary to compile a kernel
with masquerading support, and describes the use of the ipchains
binary in detail. You should enable firewalling on all machines with
exposed IP numbers.
<P>
<P>Check your startup scripts to make sure that the sequence is as
follows on the private network gateway machine:
<OL>
<LI>Outside Ethernet card is initialized.</LI>
<LI>Firewall rules are run through ipchains.</LI>
<LI>Forwarding is turned on.</LI>
<LI>Network service daemons are started.</LI>
</OL>
<P>So, as an example, on a Slackware-based system, the firewall
configuration should come between the execution of
<CODE>rc.inet1</CODE> and <CODE>rc.inet2</CODE>. Further,
if any problems arise during the firewall configuration steps, a
warning should be printed, and the external Ethernet card taken
off line before the network service daemons are run.
<P>
<P>One common problem with ipchains-based firewalls is the tedium of
making sure that your rules are correctly set for packets arriving
from the loopback interface, or arriving from either of the internal
or external interfaces on the firewall machine. These locally-sourced
packets can be blocked by a firewall. All too often, this is fixed by
a sort of shotgun debugging approach, whereby the rules for the
firewall are tweaked until all applications seem to run properly on
the firewall host again. Unfortunately, this can sometimes result in a
firewall which has unintended holes. With ipchains it is possible to
write a firewall script which is easily debugged, and which avoids
many of the packet source problems. Here is a sample script,
<CODE>/sbin/firewall.sh</CODE>:

Notice that the firewall can be used not only to block incoming
packets, but also outgoing packets which might leak information about
your private network, such as rwho and netbios packets.
<P>
<P>As noted earlier, the portmapper rules are a bit different, because
the portmap daemons register themselves with the portmapper and are
told which ports to listen on. The ports used by a particular daemon
may change as you change the RPC services used, or change their order
of startup. The following script,
<CODE>/sbin/firewall.portmap.sh</CODE> generates rule sets for the
portmapped daemons:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
ANYWHERE=0/0

IPCHAINS=/sbin/ipchains

$IPCHAINS -F portmap

# Rules for preventing access to portmapped services by people on the outside
#

                $IPCHAINS -l -A portmap -p $prot -s $ANYWHERE -d $ANYWHERE $port -j DENY || exit 1
          done
        }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

We didn't have to worry about whether packets coming in were
legitimate packets from the private network, the portmap chain is only
checked when the packets come in from the outside.
<P>
<P>This firewall configuration logs most suspicious packets through
klogd with the kern.info logging priority. It will log normal
connection attempts, as well as all known ``stealth'' probes.
<P>
<P>Now, we put these all together. We'd like to make sure that there
isn't a small window of vulnerability while the system is starting up,
so you should configure your startup sequence as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
#
# Get the network started, securely
#
#
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1              # Configure the network interfaces
                                # and set up routing.
/sbin/firewall.sh || { echo "Firewall configuration failed"
                       /sbin/ifconfig eth1 down }

/sbin/ipchains -I outside 1 -j DENY     # Deny all incoming packets

/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2              # Start the network daemons

sleep 5                         # Let them stabilize

# Secure the portmapped services
/sbin/firewall.portmap.sh || { echo "Portmap firewall configuration failed"
                               /sbin/ifconfig eth1 down }

/sbin/ipchains -D outside 1       # Allow incoming packets
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This assumes that eth1 is the interface on the externally visible IP
number. If any of the ipchains rule sets fail to install, a warning is
issued and that interface is taken off line. The ``outside'' chain is set
to deny all packets before the network service daemons are started,
because the firewalling rules are not yet in place for the portmapped
services. Once the portmapped services are firewalled, the ``outside''
chain is restored to its proper behaviour.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="config-ssh"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Configuring OpenSSH or SSH1</A>
</H2>

<P>At the time of this writing, OpenSSH, like SSH1, now offers a
configuration setting which allows you to insert <EM>scp</EM>,
<EM>ssh</EM>, and <EM>slogin</EM> as binaries named <EM>rcp</EM>,
<EM>rsh</EM>, and <EM>rlogin</EM>, with transparent fall-through in
the ssh client programs to the original <EM>rsh</EM>, <EM>rcp</EM>, or
<EM>rlogin</EM> when the remote site isn't running
<EM>sshd</EM>. Making an invocation of <EM>rsh</EM> run, instead, the
<EM>ssh</EM> client program is, in my opinion, important for keeping
the security easy to use and out of the way of the users. Everybody's
scripts, <EM>rdist</EM> configurations, and so on will continue to
work without modification if the remote site is running <EM>sshd</EM>,
but data will be sent encrypted, with strong host authentication. The
converse will not always be true. Specifically, if the remote machine
is not running <EM>sshd</EM>, the <EM>rsh</EM> program will echo a
diagnostic to the screen warning that the connection is
unencrypted. This message breaks <EM>rdist</EM>, and possibly other
programs. The message cannot be suppressed with command line or
compile time switches. For <EM>rdist</EM>, one solution is to invoke
the program with <CODE>-p /usr/lib/rsh/rsh</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Obtain ssh1 from the 
<A HREF="http://www.ssh.org/">ssh web site</A>, or OpenSSH from the 
<A HREF="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH web site</A>, and compile it to replace the unencrypted
r-programs (<EM>rsh</EM>, <EM>rlogin</EM>, and <EM>rcp</EM>). First,
copy those three files to <CODE>/usr/lib/rsh/</CODE>, then configure the
ssh package with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 ./configure --with-rsh=/usr/lib/rsh/rsh --program-transform-name='s/^s/r/' --prefix=/usr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Install the binaries, and configure according to the directions. On
the private network gateway machine, make sure that the sshd
configuration has the following entries defined:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ListenAddress 192.168.1.1       # fred's internal IP
IgnoreRhosts no
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
RhostsAuthentication no
RhostsRSAAuthentication yes
RSAAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication yes
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You will have to do further configuration of other entries in the
<CODE>/etc/sshd_config</CODE> file, but try not to change these
fields. Once you have all of the entries in the file set to your
satisfaction, copy this entire file into a new file,
<CODE>/etc/sshd_config.ext</CODE>, for the external
network. Change two fields in the new file: the ``ListenAddress'' should
be changed to the private network gateway's external IP number
(10.1.1.9 in our fred.example.com case), and ``PasswordAuthentication''
should be set to ``no'' in <CODE>/etc/sshd_config.ext</CODE>. In
your network services startup script, start sshd twice, once with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/sshd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and once with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/sshd -f /etc/sshd_config.ext
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will create two running sshd daemons. The one operating on the
internal interface will allow logins with passwords, but the external
interface will require an RSA key validation before anybody can log
on.
<P>
<P>Next, turn off incoming telnet and shell services in the inetd
configuration file (note that the firewall configuration listed in
section 
<A HREF="#filtering">Configuring Your Firewall</A> already
prevents access from outside, but it's best to defend in depth, don't
rely on everything working correctly).
<P>
<P>People who want to be able to log in from home, or from out of town,
will need an RSA key. Make sure they know how to do this, so they
don't spend their energies trying to figure out another way to do it,
like running a telnetd on an unprivileged port on your firewall
machine.
<P>
<P>An RSA key is generated by the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -f new_rsa_key
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You will be prompted for a pass phrase. This should <EM>not</EM> be
blank. A person with access to the file
<CODE>new_rsa_key</CODE>, and knowledge of the pass phrase, has
everything necessary to pass an RSA authentication challenge. The
pass phrase can be an ``unguessable'' password, or a long sentence, but
make it something non-trivial. The file <CODE>new_rsa_key</CODE>
can be copied to a floppy disk, or onto a laptop, and, along with the
pass phrase, can be used to log into accounts which are set to grant
access to that particular RSA key.
<P>
<P>To configure an account to allow access by a particular RSA key,
simply create a <CODE>$HOME/.ssh/</CODE> directory for that user
on the private network gateway machine (i.e. the machine which will be
receiving the login attempt), and copy the file
<CODE>new_rsa_key.pub</CODE> which was created by the
"ssh-keygen" command into the file
<CODE>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</CODE>. See the section
``AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT'' in the sshd man page for details on
other options you can add to the key, such as requiring the login to
come from a certain IP or host name, or authorizing the key only to
permit the remote invocation of certain commands (for instance, an RSA
key which commands a backup to take place, or commands a status report
to be emailed somewhere off site).
<P>
<P>Only one thing remains to make the RSA key mechanism as gentle as
possible to the users. If a user is forced to enter the pass phrase
more than once or twice in a session, they are likely to become bored
and take security matters into their own hands. Under Linux, arrange
their login shell to be invoked under <EM>ssh-agent</EM>. For
instance, if the company laptop used on business trips runs
<EM>xdm</EM>, and drops users into an X session, go into the
<CODE>/var/X11R6/lib/xdm/Xsession_0</CODE> file and change the lines which
invoke the startup, which are probably of the form:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
exec "$startup"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

into lines of the form:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
exec ssh-agent "$startup"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In my xdm setup, there are three such lines which should be altered in
that one file. Now, when the user logs onto the laptop, he enters the
command
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ssh-add new_rsa_key
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

at any prompt, enters the pass phrase when prompted, and all windows
will have pass phrase-free access to the account on the private network
gateway until the user logs off his X session on the laptop.
<P>
<P>Run sshd on all of the machines on your private network, as well as on
any exposed hosts. For machines other than the private network gateway
machine, the ListenAddress entry in
<CODE>/etc/sshd_config</CODE> can be set to ``0.0.0.0''.  You
should set up the host keys with the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -f /etc/ssh_host_key -N ""
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

then run <EM>make-ssh-known-hosts</EM> and distribute the
<CODE>/etc/ssh_known_hosts</CODE> file among all of the machines
on the private and public networks. 
<P>
<P>Disable incoming telnet and the unencrypted r-services. Don't delete
the <EM>telnet</EM> binary, it's useful for things other than simple
telnet sessions on port 23. You should allow password authentication
on the private network, and disable it on the exposed machines,
requiring an RSA key to log onto the exposed hosts.
<P>
<P>It is convenient for the users if the hosts on the private network are
mentioned in each other's <CODE>/etc/hosts.equiv</CODE>
files. The sshd daemons will respect those, and allow people to rlogin
and rsh between machines without passwords or pass phrases. On every
connection, the machines will be verifying each other's identities
with host-level RSA keys.
<P>
<P>One difficulty arises when a user logged onto a machine on the private
network wants to log onto a box on an exposed IP number. You can't use
<CODE>/etc/hosts.equiv</CODE> or <CODE>$HOME/.shosts</CODE> to allow
password-less validation, because the user is coming from a machine
whose IP number cannot be determined - it will appear to be coming
from the masquerading firewall machine, but the host keys won't
match. There are two solutions to this. First, if you insist on using
the <CODE>/etc/hosts.equiv</CODE> or <CODE>$HOME/.shosts</CODE>
methods, the user will have to log onto the private network gateway
machine (fred.example.com in our example here), and then log through
to the exposed machine from there. The other technique is to use RSA
key authentication, that always works regardless of what games are
going on with IP numbers and host name lookups.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Configuring X</A>
</H2>

<P>In the user's continuing quest to prove that he values convenience
over security, it has become common for people to put 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xhost +
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

commands right into their X initialization scripts. This grants X
server access to everybody in the world. Now the random outsider can
change your root window graphic to something embarrassing while your
boss is showing his mother around your office. Alternately, this
outsider can quietly monitor every keystroke you issue, and dump the
contents of your screen to his desktop. Needless to say, this doesn't
bode well for passwords used to log into other sites, or for sensitive
documents being edited on screen. The xhost protocol itself is
inherently limited, as it is not possible to grant permissions to use
the screen on a user basis, only on a machine basis.
<P>
<P>Enter <EM>xauth</EM> authentication. If you have <EM>xdm</EM> you
probably already are running <EM>xauth</EM> authentication, but
<EM>xhost</EM> still works, and might still be what people are using
to run X processes between machines. Once again, the goal is to make
the security easy enough to use that the users aren't tempted to run
the <EM>xhost</EM> command anymore.
<P>
<P>The sshd setup described in section 
<A HREF="#config-ssh">Configuring SSH1</A>, with the ``X11Forwarding'' flag set, is
actually simpler to use than the <EM>xhost</EM> technique. Once you
have logged into your terminal, you can simply rlogin to a remote
machine, and run <EM>netscape</EM>, <EM>xv</EM>, or whatever you like,
without having to set the $DISPLAY variable name or allow
explicit permissions. During <EM>ssh</EM> login, it configures the
system in a way transparent to the end user, and even encrypts all of
your X packets before they go over the network.
<P>
<P>If you are unable to use the sshd X11 forwarding for some reason, you
should use <EM>xauth</EM> when you want to authorize other machines to have
access to your X server. Document this for the users, or create
specialized shell scripts to help them out. The relevant command to
authorize a particular login, ``jpublic'', on machine ``barney'' to have
access to your X server is: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
/usr/X11/bin/xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh -l jpublic barney /usr/X11/bin/xauth merge -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This sequence is not necessary to authorize X connections from
machines which share a common NFS-mounted home directory. The xauth
key will be immediately available to that user on all machines which
mount the same home directory.
<P>
<P>I'd be tempted to delete <EM>xhost</EM> from your machines entirely. If it
causes problems with any programs, you will at least know that those
programs had poorly-designed security. It's simple enough to build a
shell script as a drop-in replacement for <EM>xhost</EM> which uses the
<EM>xauth</EM> sequence listed above.
<P>
<P>Note that if <EM>rsh</EM> is not the encrypting ssh program, the xauth
key is sent plaintext. Anybody who holds the plaintext of the key can
access your server, so you do not gain much security if you don't use
ssh for these transactions. Note, also, that if the users' home
directories are exported via NFS (the Network File System), the xauth
key is available in plaintext to anybody able to snoop those NFS
packets, regardless of whether you're running ssh on your systems.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Configuring Disk Sharing</A>
</H2>

<P>With email coming to a central machine, the read/send from any host
setup described here is very convenient, but some care has to be taken
to protect against trivial snooping by bored local users. NFS without
AUTH_DES implemented is inherently insecure. NFS relies on the client
machine to authenticate access, there is no password verification on
the server to make sure that the client should be permitted to access
the private files of a particular user. A Windows box can be
configured to read NFS-exported volumes as any numeric uid, completely
bypassing UNIX file permissions.  Consequently, NFS exports should
only be made to machines which are always Linux (or UNIX) boxes under
your direct control, and never ones which can be dual-booted into
Windows.  If you want to export the mail spool directory, or any other
directory, to machines which can sometimes be used as Windows boxes,
export them with samba, setting the authentication mode to
``security=USER''. Connecting the machines on your network with a
switch rather than a hub will also help, as it leaves very little of
interest for sniffers on Windows machines. Ultimately, though, it's
very difficult to secure any disk sharing over the network at the time
of this writing.

<P>Why bother, if you can't really secure the network disks? Mostly it's
an issue of credible defense. If you leave a sheet of paper on your
desk with confidential information, and somebody in the office reads
it, he can argue that he didn't realize what the paper was, his
natural curiosity just got the better of him when he saw it sitting on
the desk. If the sheet of paper were in a filing cabinet or desk
drawer, it's an entirely different story. The purpose of taking some
basic network security measures internally is to ensure that nobody
``accidentally'' compromises security.
