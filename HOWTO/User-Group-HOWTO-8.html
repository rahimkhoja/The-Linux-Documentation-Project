democracy, and turnover" section, Web site suggestions, and link

GNU/Linux news outlets; parts of sections concerning consultants, businesses,

of charge.</LI>
<LI>1.7.1: Added a bunch more newly supported embedded CPUs.</LI>
<LI>1.7.2: Added more on CPU support / ports (which section was always a bit silly, but I figure it might as well be exhaustive, correct, and <I>grandly</I> silly, if present at all); furnished matching URLs.

<LI>1.7.5: Added several more embedded CPUs to the supported list, implemented licence change (9 Jan 2004) to Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 1.0 or later after securing permission from Kendall Clark. (The HOWTO had previously been under the LDPL version posted at LDP's site in 1997, which by 2004 had become not only deprecated but also somewhat indeterminate as to content, because the licence had been edited in place with neither clear versioning nor a distinct URL for each revision.)</LI>
<LI>1.7.6: Corrected addresses for TeX User Group in USA and
UK.  Added mention of C. Northcote Parkinson's Bike Shed Effect.  Other 
minor corrections.</LI>

e-mail address.  Added Volgograd LUG to Online Resources.</LI>

used some data from it.  Added "I Linux User Group italiani".  
Corrected capitalisation of PingoS.  After securing permission from
Kendall Clark, added "or any later version" clause to document licence.</LI>
<LI>1.7.9: Corrected India Linux link and added 
<I>LINUX For You</I>, per suggestions from Rohit Kumar.  Added Linux 
Foundation to list of candidates for receiving monetary support.  Made fixes 
to Red Hat LUG list (reincarnated as "Army of Friends" database), as suggested 
by Vincenzo Virgilio. Added LinuxHQ and O'Reilly LUG lists and FSF GNU User 
Groups list.  Added Wikipedia Category:LUGs page.  Dropped material about the 
GLUE site, which SSC, Inc.  tragically deleted in mid-2006 without allowing 
anyone a chance to adopt it.  Added kernel support for two more embedded chip 
families.  Substituted static mirrors for two (vanished) pages listing 
Linux kernel ports.  Dropped <I>LinuxWorld Magazine</I> (vanished).  
Removed references to getting help in founding LUGs from Red Hat User 
Group Program and Kara Pritchard's LinuxUserGroups.org (both vanished) 
and from lug.net (deactivated).  Added Swedish tax/regulatory details 
from Martin Karlsson.  Added analysis of issues surrounding incorporation, 
tax-exempt status, and insurance in the USA.  Found new URLs for a vast 
number of links.  Updated licence to Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0, to 
incorporate improvements.  Re-sorted country coverage into alphabetical 
order (a small gesture to further reduce US-centrism).</LI>
<LI>1.8.0:  Corrected typos.  Improved some markup.  Expanded "Common Misconceptions Debunked" section to address recently popular errors about USA Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, civil liability, and IRS 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  Linked directly to the Act and an analysis page.  Furnished links for <I>Non-Lawyers' Non-Profit Corporation Kit</I>, for <I>DistroWatch Weekly</I>, and for the Raymond quotation.</LI>
<LI>1.8.1:  Banished more typos.  (I blame society.)</LI>
<LI>1.8.2:  Added more CPU ports.  APCUG changed Web sites.  Linux India's LUG list, lugww.counter.li.org, Red Hat Army of Friends, LUG Webring, O'Reilly LinuxGroups, and LINUX For You Magazine (of India) LUG List vanished.  IDG moved the Raymond article (again).  LinuxFocus was revived via a CMS.  NewsForge was shut down by The Company Formerly Known as VA Linux.  Linux International Development Grant Fund program vanished.  Project Gutenberg moved to its own domain.  Colorado Linux Users and Enthusiasts moved.  Added mention of IRS e-Postcard for 501(c) non-profits.  Added Linux Users Group - Delhi.  Added New Zealand Linux Resource.  Added Project Runeberg.</LI>
<LI>1.8.3:  Replacement ARM Linux Web site.  New URLs for many embedded and other systems.  SoftBlaze renamed to PetaLinux.a  LUGs WorldWide Project, Linux Online -- User Groups, LinuxHQ User Groups, and New Zealand Linux Resource vanished.  Free Software Foundation GNU Users Groups got moved/renamed to LibrePlanet Group List.  New URLs for LinuxFormat and LinuxCounter.  PingoS e.V. vanished (though its SelfLinux project for hypertext tutorials in the German language persists).
