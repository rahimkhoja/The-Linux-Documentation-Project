<P>
<P>Upon starting TkRat, You'll notice that you are in a folder called "INBOX".  Use fetchmail to download any new mail.  If you have any, it will appear in this INBOX folder.
<P>TkRat has an intuitive interface.  The top half of the screen is the list of messages you have (Each line is a seperate E-Mail).  The bottom half of the screen will be the actual content of the E-Mail.
<P>You can read E-Mails by simply clicking on any message in the list.
<P>When you are finished reading a message, you can move on the next message, reply to that message, compose a new message, or move the message to a different "Folder".
<P>Folders are a way of storing E-Mails into seperate "Folders".  This way, you can keep several folders for different topics you may receive E-Mail about.
<P>Perform the following steps to create folders:
<OL>
<LI>Click on Admin, then New/Edit Folders</LI>
<LI>You will see a box with a "INBOX" folder.  Left-Click in that box.</LI>
<LI>You are then presented with a menu, so select "New File Folder".</LI>
<LI>You'll be given a dialogue box asking for information.</LI>
<LI>In the first textbox - enter a name for the folder.</LI>
<LI>In the second textbox - enter the filename you will use to store the messages in (Hint: Use something like /home/username/mail/name_of_folder.
So, if the first field says "Personal", the second field would say something like "/home/dave/mail/personal" (assuming your username is dave).</LI>
<LI>Click OK.  You'll notice your new folder is now in the list of folders.  So, go to "Window" and then "Close".</LI>
</OL>
<P>You can now Move messages to the new folder - and switch to that folder by selecting the folder's name under the "Folders" menu.
<P>Sending mail is also easy.  Click "Compose", type in the recipient's E-Mail address, type in a subject, and then write the message in the body.
<P>When you are finished, click on Send.
