>3.1.1. Kernel Module Aliases and Parameters</A
></H3
><P
>		Most drivers accept arguments in the form of module paramters (with the
		exception of the special case of PCMCIA, which is fully described below).
		</P
><P
>		Kernel modules are specified in the file /etc/conf.modules or /etc/modules.conf 
		depending upon which version of modutils you've got.
		</P
><P
>		You can directly modify this file or use the tools builtin to your specific
		distribution. These distribution specific tools are beyond the scope of this 
		document, but you can always directly modify the modules.conf file by hand
		to get things up and running and then figure out how your distribution 
		handles these files. For example, Debian has several files in the /etc/modutils
		directory and from these builds the modules.conf file. 
		</P
><P
>		Kernel modules aliases are utilized to associate a particular name with a 
		kernel module.
		</P
><P
>		For token ring, this is used to assign drivers for each of the token ring
		interfaces so that the system scripts know which driver to insert when
		you bring an interface up.
		</P
><P
>		The format of the alias lines are:
		<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>		alias <EM
>module_name</EM
> interface
		</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
		Usually, the only line you'll need for the token ring networking would be
		something like:
		<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>alias olympic tr0</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
		This binds the olympic driver to the tr0 interface so when you type
		<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>ifconfig tr0 up</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
		if the tr0 interface is not already loaded, the system will insert the 
		olympic driver, which in turn will find the network card and create
		the tr0 network device.
		</P
><P
>		Kernel modules parameters are specified in the following format:
		<TABLE

		Where the modules_name is the name of the driver, i.e. olympic, ibmtr, 3c359 and the
	`	parameters are those available for each driver. See either the following sections for 
		driver specifics or check out the drivers source code. 
		</P
><P

		a default buffer size of 8192 bytes, you would use the following line:

><P
>		IBM Tropic Chipset Based Token Ring Adapters
		</P
><P
>		This is the original token ring driver in the kernel and supports almost all 
		adapters that use the IBM Tropic chipset, including the IBM ISA, ISA/Pnp, and
		a multitude of adapters from other manufacturers.
		</P
><P
>		The IBM Turbo 16/4 ISA/PnP adapter will, in fact, work fine with the ibmtr driver.
		In older drivers you had to run the card in Auto 16/4 compatability mode.
		The simplest way to set this is to use the LANAID disks
		sent with the card and run the command:
		<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>LANAIDC /FAST=AUTO16</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
		You should then use LANAIDC or LANAID
		to configure the card according to documentation.
		The latest drivers for the Turbo Adapters will recognize these adapters 
		and configure them straight out of the box. You may have to either turn
		off isapnp support in the kernel or modify your isapnp.conf file to 
		enable the adapter.
		</P
><P
>		Options:
		</P
><P
>		Perusal of the ibmtr source code may leave you to believe that the adapter can
		take three parameters, however, in reality the driver doesn't take any. These
		parameters are a hang over from the early stages of the driver and are only 
		intended to be used to force the driver to only test restricted åddresses when
		looking for adapters. The information on these options are included here for 
		completeness only.

		Then just run make config|menuconfig|xconfig and select the 3c359 driver from the
		token ring drivers section of the kernel configuration and then compile and install 
		the kernel and/or modules as usual. 
		</P
><P
>		Options:
		</P
><P
>		The driver accepts three options: ringspeed, pkt_buf_sz,  
		message_level. 
		</P
><P
>		These options can be specified differently for each card found, i.e if you
		have two olympic adapters in your machine and want to assign a ring speed of 16mbps 
		to the first adapter, but a ring speed of 4mbps to the second adapter, your options
		line would read:

		However, it should be noted that the driver assigns value to each adapter in the 
		order they are discovered¸ which is usually the order there are present on the pci

>:  Has one of three settings 0 (default), 4 or 16.  0 will 
				make the card autosense the ringspeed and join at the appropriate speed, 
				this will be the default option for most people.  4 or 16 allow you to 
				explicitly force the card to operate at a certain speed.  The card will fail 
				if you try to insert it at the wrong speed. (Although some hubs will allow 
				this so be *very* careful).  The main purpose for explicitly setting the ring
				speed is for when the card is first on the ring. In autosense mode, if the card
				cannot detect any active monitors on the ring it will open at the same speed
				as its last opening. This can be harardous if this speed does not match the
				speed you want the ring to operate at.

			position = 296,000 bytes of memory space, plus of course anything 
			necessary for the tx sk_buff's.  Remember this is per card, so if you are

>			PCMCIA Token Ring adapters will work on all versions of the Linux kernel.
			Unfortunately, the road to hell is often paved with melting snowballs ;-) 
			and there are a myriad of different combinations that can be used to get the 
			adapters to work, all with different options, different requirements and
			different issues. Hopefully with this document you will be able to figure 
			out which combinations of ingredients are required and how to get them up and 
			running on your machine.

NAME="HISTORY"
>3.1.7.2. History</A
></H4
><P
>			In the 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels days, pcmcia was only available as an external 
			package, created and maintained by David Hinds. When the only stable kernel 
			available was 2.0.36, life was pretty easy and with a few simple configuration 
			options the adapters would work.
			</P
><P
> 
			With the advent of 2.2.x, ibmtr.c was completely updated, which broke the pcmcia 
			driver (ibmtr_cs.c). The pcmcia driver was updated to work with the new ibmtr driver 
			and the 2.2.x kernels. This is where the first level of complication starts. As 
			the pcmcia_cs package is stand alone, it has to support the various different 
			kernels, so instead of being able to have different versions of drivers in different 
			versions of the kernel source, the pcmcia_cs drivers must work with all kernel 
			versions. This not only creates some ugliness in the driver itself but also causes 
			confusion as to which version of pcmcia_cs works for the latest kernel.
			</P
><P
>			At this point, everything was working fine, and then come along the 2.3.x develpment 
			series of kernels. The 2.3.x kernels provided their own support for pcmcia and the 
			ibmtr_cs driver was included in the kernel proper. So now there were two ways of 
			getting pcmcia token ring support, either using the kernel drivers themselves or 
			using the pcmcia_cs package, not too much of a problem because only developers were 
			using the 2.3.x kernels. Of course this all changed when the 2.4 kernel was released 
			and a lot more users started using the kernel.
			</P
><P
> 
			During late 2000, early 2001, significant development work was done on both the 
			standard ibmtr driver and the pcmcia driver. Original pcmcia updates including using 
			high memory and hot-eject support. These initial updates were only for the 2.2.x kernels, 
			and hence only included in the pcmcia_cs package. Later development saw great improvements
			in ibmtr and ibmtr_cs for the 2.4.x kernels. So as of writing, 1/23/02 , there are many 
			different combinations of kernel version and driver floating around especially considering 
			that different distributions have released different versions of the 2.4 kernels.

>			The pcmcia driver need to allocate two areas of memory to operate properly. All areas of memory 
			allocated must be aligned on the same boundary as the size of the area being aligned, i.e. 
			a block 8K in size must be on an 8K boundary (0xc8000, 0xca000, 0xcc000, 0xce000, 0xd0000, 0xd2000) 
			and for a 16K block must be on a 16K boundary (0xc8000, 0xcc000, 0xd0000, 0xd4000). All memory 
			areas must be allocated within the ISA address space, 0xC0000-0xDFFFF). Theoretically you should be 
			able to use anywhere within this area, although experience has shown that most machines hide 
			stuff in the 0xc0000-0xc9fff area. Some machines have even been known to use the 0xd0000-0xd1fff 
			area without telling anybody (some thinkpads !!). So you really want to stick with memory 
			allocations in the 0xcc000 - 0xdffff range.
			</P
><P
>			Of course, the two memory areas cannot overlap either ;)
			</P
><P
>			The first area of memory is an 8K area for the memory mapped input/output (MMIO) and must be 
			placed on an 8K boundary. This area of memory is not usually the cause of any problems and can be 
			placed pretty much anywhere, recommended values are: 0xcc000, 0xd0000,0xd2000,0xd4000.
			</P
><P
> 
			The second area of memory can be sized to fit your desires, this is the area of memory where the 
			incoming and outgoing packets are stored and received.  The driver defaults to a 16K memory size 
			and must be placed on a 16K boundary. Good areas are: 0xd0000,0xd4000,0xd8000.
			</P
><P
>			Once you've decided which areas of memory you are goin to try, you need to add the correct line 
			to the /etc/pcmcia/config.opts file. Configuration lines in this file take the format of:
			<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>			module "module_name" opts "option1=opt1_value option2=opt2_value ...."
			</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
			In our case module_name is ibmtr_cs. There are three options that be set with the ibmtr_cs driver, 
			mmiobase, srambase and sramsize.
			</P
><P
>			If they are not set they will revert to the defaults in the driver, which in 9 cases out of 10 
			won't work for you. sramsize rarely has to be set unless you are looking for that last little bit 
			of performance from your adapter.
			</P
><P
>			So, having decided upon your values, let's say 0xd2000 for the MMIO and 0xd4000 for the shared 
			memory you would build a config.opts line like this:
			<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

>			module "ibmtr_cs" opts "mmiobase=0xd2000 srambase=0xd4000" 
			</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
			The pcmcia_cs package must be restarted for these new options to take effect, usually with: 
			<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT

>/etc/init.d/pcmcia restart or /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia/restart</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
			depending upon which run level organization your distribution adheres to. 
			</P
><P
>			Then just plug it in and see if it works. If not you'll just have to go back and change the 
			values for mmiobase and srambase until you find a combination that works.
			Or, you can upgrade to a kernel/pcmcia_cs version that support high memory allocation, 
			where all this config.opts nonsense is not required and you can just happily plug your adapter 
			in and watch it run.
