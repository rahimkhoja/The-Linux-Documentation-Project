>	See www.linuxtr.net for the latest greatest set of bugs. Generally
	speaking the biggest problem that I've seen (with ibmtr) is that
	if you pull your connection from the wall the 2.0.x series of
	kernels would generally not recover.
	</P
><P
>	This has been fixed in the latest version of ibmtr and the driver
	should now recognize when the link cable has been detached. 
	</P
><P
>	There are some laptops that don't want to work with the Olympic Cardbus 
	adapter, for some reason the driver never sees the open interrupt from the
	card. I don't think this is a problem with the driver, but with the Cardbus
	subsystem, for some people this problem has simply gone away with a newer
	kernel and I personally have never seen it on the laptops I've used in the
	development of the driver (Sony Vaio Z505 and Dell Latitude CPx500).
