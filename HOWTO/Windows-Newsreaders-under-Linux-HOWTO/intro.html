>&#13;One of the problems with Linux today is the lack of variety and choice in 
newsreader software, where Windows has several newsreader programs with better
features and better stability. Under Windows, three of the most popular 
newsreaders are Xnews, Dialog, and Free Agent.
</P
><P
>&#13;Xnews, created by Luu Tran, is a freeware newsreader for Windows,
available from the website
<A
HREF="http://xnews.newsguy.com/"

>. Here 
is a list of Xnews' features listed on the website:

>&#13;Unfortunately, Luu Tran has decided neither to make his newsreader
open-source nor to release a Linux version. However, there is a way to get
Xnews to work under Linux, although it takes a bit of work.
</P
><P
>&#13;Dialog is a newsreader by 40tude. It is available at
<A
HREF="http://www.40tude.com/dialog/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.40tude.com/dialog/</A
>.
According to the website, "it supports multiple servers and identities, has
filtering/scoring support, integrated email functionality and binary support
including support for multiparts." The newsreader is "shareware for
commercial users and freeware for private users." It works excellently
under Linux. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Free Agent is the feature-slimmed freeware version of Forte's commercial 
e-mail and Usenet client Agent. It is available at
<A
HREF="http://www.forteinc.com/agent"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.forteinc.com/agent/</A
>.
According to the Features section of the website, the program has basic
newsreader functions, message threading, multi-part binaries, translations,
internal multi-tasking, and URL detection. It also has partial support for
offline data storage, group properties, UI configuration, searching, and
sorting. It runs with few problems under Linux after almost no extra 
configuration, except under Wine versions later than 20030813.

>&#13;This HOWTO assumes that:
</P

><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;The InfoZIP utilities are installed on the Linux machine. These are available
at <A
HREF="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/"
TARGET="_top"
>InfoZIP's web site.</A
>
The unzip program is required if the reader wants to install Xnews or Dialog 
without copying from an existing installation. This is a standard part 
of most Linux distributions, but may not be automatically installed.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;The Wine "emulator" is installed properly on the Linux machine. To
download Wine, visit 
<A
HREF="http://www.winehq.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.winehq.com</A
>. 
The version used at the
time of this writing was 20031212.
UPDATE (version 2.01): Wine versions later than 20030813 will not work. 
UPDATE (version 2.2): Wine version 20031212 may be required under more modern 
Linux setups. There are more problems with this version, and Dialog will not
work, but older Wine versions will not "emulate" properly without it 
and will cause a crash upon trying to access NNTP servers. Try 20030813 first,
and then try version 20031212 if you have problems.

>&#13;The reader of this document has access to a Windows machine. Certain files are 
needed from the Windows operating system. Access to Windows 98SE is preferred. 
This HOWTO covers Windows 98SE and Windows XP. Windows ME files will also work
when running Xnews if a Windows 98SE configuration is used.
