<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Setting up WWW server systems</A></H2>

<P>This section contains information on different http server software
packages and additional server side tools like script languages for
CGI programs etc.  There are several dozen web servers, I only covered those
that are fully functional.  As some of these are commercial products, 
I have no way of trying
them.  Most of the information in the overview section was pieced together
from various web sites. 
If there is any incorrect or missing information please let me know.
<P>For a technical description on the http mechanism, take a look at
the RFC documents mentioned in the chapter "For further reading" of
this HOWTO.
<P>I prefer to use the Apache server.  It has almost all the features you would
ever need and its free!  I will admit that this section is heavily biased
toward Apache.  I decided to concentrate my efforts on the Apache section
rather than spread it out over all the web servers.  I may cover other web
servers in the future.

<DL>
<DT><B>Cern httpd</B><DD><P>This was the first web server.  It was developed by the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN).  CERN httpd is no longer
supported.  The CERN httpd server
is reported to have some ugly bugs, to be quite slow and resource hungry. 
The latest version is 3.0.  For more information visit the CERN httpd home
page at 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Daemon/Status.html">http://www.w3.org/Daemon/Status.html</A>.
It is available for download at
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/www/servers/httpd-3.0.term.tpz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/www/servers/httpd-3.0.term.tpz</A>
(no it is not a typo, the extension is actually .tpz on the site; probably 
should be .tgz)
<P>
<DT><B>NCSA HTTPd</B><DD><P>The NCSA HTTPd server is the father to Apache (The
development split into two different servers).   Therefore the setup files
are very similar.  NCSA HTTPd is free and the source code is available.  
This server not covered in this document, although
reading the Apache section may give you some help.  The NCSA server was once
popular, but most people are replacing it with Apache.  Apache is a drop in
replacement for the NCSA server(same configuration files), and it fixes several
shortcomings of the NCSA server.  NCSA HTTPd accounts for 4.9% (and
falling) of all web servers. (source September 1997 
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft survey</A>).
The latest version is 1.5.2a.  For
more information see the NCSA website at 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>
<A HREF="WWW-HOWTO-7.html#apache">Apache</A></B><DD><P>Apache is the king of all web
servers.  Apache and its source code is free.  Apache is modular, therefore
it is easy to add features.  Apache is very flexible and has many, many
features.  Apache 
and its derivatives makes up 44% of all web domains (50% if you count all
the derivatives).  
There are over 695,000 Apache servers in operation (source November 1997 
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft survey</A>).
<P>The official Apache is missing SSL, but there are two
derivatives that fill the gap.  Stronghold is a commercial product that is
based on Apache.  It retails for $995; an economy version is available for
$495 (based on an old version of Apache).  Stronghold is the number two
secure server behind Netscape (source 
<A HREF="http://www.c2.net/products/stronghold">C2 net</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft survey</A>).  
For more information visit the Stronghold website at 
<A HREF="http://www.c2.net/products/stronghold/">http://www.c2.net/products/stronghold/</A>.  It was developed
outside the US, so it is available with 128 bit SSL everywhere.
<P>Apache-SSL is a free implementation of SSL, but it is not for commercial use
in the US (RSA has US patents on SSL technology).  It can be used for
non-commercial use in the US if you link with the free RSAREF library.  For
more information see the website at 
<A HREF="http://www.algroup.co.uk/Apache-SSL/">http://www.algroup.co.uk/Apache-SSL/</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Netscape Fast Track Server</B><DD><P>Fast Track was developed by Netscape, but the
Linux version is put out by Caldera.  The Caldera site lists it as Fast
Track for OpenLinux.  I'm not sure if it only runs on Caldera OpenLinux or
if any Linux distribution will do (E-mail me if you have the answer). 
Netscape servers account for 11.5% (and falling) of all web servers (source 
September 1997 
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">http://www.netcraft.com/survey/</A>).
The server sells for $295.  It is also included with the Caldera OpenLinux
Standard distribution which sells for $399 ($199.50 educational).  The web
pages tell of a nice administration interface and
a quick 10 minute setup.  The server has support for 40-bit SSL.  
To get the full 128-bit SSL you need 
Netscape Enterprise Server.  Unfortunately that is not available for Linux :(
The latest version available for Linux is 2.0 (Version 3 is in beta, but its
not available for Linux yet).  
To buy a copy goto the Caldera web site at 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/products/netscape/netscape.html">http://www.caldera.com/products/netscape/netscape.html</A>

<DT><B>WN</B><DD><P>WN has many features that make it attractive.  First it is smaller
than the CERN, NCSA HTTPd, an Apache servers.  It also has many built-in
features that would require CGI's.  For example site searches, enhanced
server side includes.  It can also decompress/compress files on the fly
with its filter feature.  It also has the ability to retrieve only part of a
file with its ranges feature.  It is released under the GNU public license.  
The current version is 1.18.3. For more information see the WN website at
<A HREF="http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/">http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>AOLserver</B><DD><P>AOLserver is made by America Online.  I'll admit that I
was surprised by the features of a web server coming from AOL.  In addition
to the standard features it supports database connectivity.  Pages can query
a database by Structured Query Language (SQL) commands.  The database is
access through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).  It also has built-in
search engine and TCL scripting.  If that is not enough you can add your own
modules through the c Application Programming Interface (API).  I almost
forgot to mention support for 40 bit SSL.  And you get all this for free!
For more information visit the AOLserver site at 
<A HREF="http://www.aolserver.com/server/">http://www.aolserver.com/server/</A><P>
<DT><B>Zeus Server</B><DD><P>Zeus Server was developed by Zeus Technology.  They claim
that they are the fastest web server (using WebSpec96 benchmark).  The
server can be configured and controlled from a web browser!  It can limit processor and memory
resources for CGI's, and it executes them in a secure environment (whatever
that means).  It also supports unlimited virtual servers.  It sells for $999
for the standard version.  If you want the secure server (SSL) the price jumps
to $1699.  They are based outside the US so 128 bit SSL is available
everywhere.  For more information visit the Zeus Technology website at
<A HREF="http://www.zeus.co.uk">http://www.zeus.co.uk</A>.  The US website is at 
<A HREF="http://www.zeus.com">http://www.zeus.com</A>.
I'll warn you they are cocky about the
fastest web server thing.  But they don't even show up under top web servers
in the Netcraft Surveys.
<P>
<DT><B>CL-HTTP</B><DD><P>CL-HTTP stands for Common Lisp Hypermedia Server.  If you are
a Lisp programmer this server is for you.  You can write your CGI scripts in
Lisp.  It has a web based setup function.  It also supports all the standard
server features.  CL-HTTP is free and the source code is available.  
For more information visit the CL-HTTP website at
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html</A>
(could they make that url any longer?).
</DL>
<P>If you have a commercial purpose (company web site, or ISP), I would
strongly recommend that you use Apache.  If you are looking for easy setup at the
expense of advanced features then the Zeus Server wins hands down.  I've
also heard that the Netscape Server is easy to setup.
If you have an internal use you can be a bit more flexible. 
But unless one of them has a feature that you just have to use, I
would still recommend using one of the three above.
<P>This is only a partial listing of all the servers available.  For a more
complete list visit Netcraft at
