<P>There are several different flavors of Emacs.  The two most popular are 
GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  GNU Emacs is put out by the Free Software 
Foundation, and is the original Emacs.  It is mainly geared toward text based
terminals, but it does run in X-Windows.  XEmacs (formerly Lucid Emacs)
is a version that only runs on X-Windows.  It has many special features that
are X-Windows related (better menus etc).

<P>
<P>Both the Red Hat and Slackware distributions include GNU Emacs.
<P>The most recent GNU emacs is 19.34.  It doesn't seem to
have a web site.  The FTP site is
at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</A>.
<P>The latest version of XEmacs is 20.2.  The XEmacs FTP site is at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs">ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs</A>.
For more information about XEmacs goto see its web page at
<A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org">http://www.xemacs.org</A>.
<P>Both are available from the Linux archives at
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu under /pub/Linux/apps/editors/emacs/</A> 
<P>
<P>If you got GNU Emacs or XEmacs installed, you probably got the W3 browser
running to.
<P>The Emacs W3 mode is a nearly fully featured web browser system 
written in the Emacs Lisp system. It mostly deals with text, but can 
display graphics, too - at least - if you run the emacs under the X Window
system.
<P>To get XEmacs in to W3 mode, goto the apps menu and select browse the web.
<P>I don't use Emacs, so if someone will explain how to get it into the W3 mode
I'll add it to this document.  Most of this information was from the
original author.  If any information is incorrect, please let me know.  Also 
let me know if you think anything else should be added about Emacs.
