<P>
<P>As firewalls are in more and more widely use in internet and intranet security, the ability to do nice VPNs is important. Here are my experiences. Comments are welcome.

<P>
<P>I will use the terms "master firewall" and "slave firewall", though making a VPN has nothing to do with client-server architecture. I simply refer to them as the active and passive participants of the connection's setup. The host which is starts the setup will be referred as the master, and the passive participant will be the slave.
