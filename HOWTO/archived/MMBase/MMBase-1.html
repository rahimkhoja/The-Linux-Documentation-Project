<P>
<P>If you got this document from a Linux HOWTO mirror site or a CD-ROM,
you might want to check back to the 
<A HREF="http://www.dnd.utwente.nl/~joost/mmbase-mini/MMBase-Mini-HOWTO.html">MMBase Mini-HOWTO home page</A> to see if there's a
newer version around.
<P>
<P>This document only covers a very small portion of MMBase installation, for 
the official documentation visit 
<A HREF="http://www.mmbase.org">MMBase home page</A>.

<P>Finally, this is my first HOWTO, my first experience with linuxdoc and I am no expert on 
MMBase either. I am just trying to share my solutions to some problems I encountered while installing
MMBase on a Debian system.

<P>I would like to thank a number of people for helping me during my quest for a clean installation. 
Although I do not know their names, their nicknames on irc are: <EM>keesj, jdg, flax, scb2</EM>. 
I hope they forgive me for not trying to find out their real names.
<P>I would also like to thank my employer, the <EM>University of Twente</EM> for allowing me to write this
document during working hours.
