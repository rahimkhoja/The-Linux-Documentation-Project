<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Configuration</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>Congratulations, you have Oracle running on your Linux box. You have
created a database and can connect to it using SQL*Plus.
<P>Of course, this is not the end of it. Ideally, you'd be able to
connect to it as another Unix user or from a completely different
machine. That is what this section is for.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Connecting as another user</A>
</H2>

<P>Some of the details in this section are a little sketchy as this is
not a configuration that I personally use. However, performing one of
the following steps should work:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<PRE>
. oraenv
</PRE>
 if you run a Bourne-like shell (like Bash
or pdksh)</LI>
<LI>
<PRE>
source coraenv
</PRE>
 if you prefer the C-Shell</LI>
</UL>
<P>When running "oraenv" I get an error if I use 'bash', the default
Linux shell. It seems not to cause any problems so don't worry. You
can always use 'pdksh' if it <I>does</I> worry you.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Connecting from another machine</A>
</H2>

<P>I remember this being very complex with earlier versions of Oracle,
but just seemed to work here. I'm sure that must mean that I did
something wrong, forgot something I did or that there's a massive
security hole.
<P>This is what I remember doing:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Logging into Linux as user 'oracle'</LI>
<LI>Make sure that "oraenv" has been executed (i.e., your
<CODE>$ORACLE_HOME</CODE> is set correctly)</LI>
<LI>Type: 
<PRE>
lsnrctl start
</PRE>

</LI>
</OL>
<P>On your client machine all you need to do now is point it at the right
machine and database instance.
<P>If you want more control over the process, the "Net8 Configuration
Assistant" ('netec') should be able to help.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Connecting to another machine</A>
</H2>

<P>This used to be very difficult in many earlier version of Oracle,
involving editing many text files, most of which had an fantastically
complex syntax.
<P>But in 8i, if you've got your JVM working, then all you need is the
"Net8 Easy Config" program. Follow these steps to allow your machine
to connect to a database on another machine:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Start "Net8 Easy Config" by typing <CODE>netec</CODE> at the command
prompt while logged in as 'oracle.'
</LI>
<LI>After a short delay while Java gets its act together, the
welcome screen appears. It should be asking what you want to do. Leave
the radio buttons on the left alone (the default is 'create') and
enter the name of the database in the text box. Click 'Next' when
you're done.
</LI>
<LI>Select one of the protocols it offers. Unless you know
differently, this should probably be 'TCP/IP' which is the
default. Press 'Next.'
</LI>
<LI>Enter the hostname (or IP address) of the remote machine. The
port number probably doesn't need changing. Press 'Next.'
</LI>
<LI>Select the type of database (8i or other) using the radio
buttons and enter the name in the appropriate text box. Press 'Next.'
</LI>
<LI>You can now test that the information you've enter makes sense
to Oracle. I found that 'netec' has a tendency to crash if some of the
details are wrong. Press 'Next' when you're sure that it all
works. You can keep pressing the 'Back' button to go back and correct
any information.
</LI>
<LI>If you're happy with all the information you've entered, you can
press the 'Finish' button and that's it!
</LI>
</OL>
<P>If you want more control over the process, you may need to use the
"Net8 Assistant" -- a big window with many confusing options -- which
can be started with the <CODE>netasst</CODE> command.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Questions and answers</A>
</H2>

<H3>I can't start 'netasst'</H3>

<P>The problem is with a couple of zero-length files. Installing the
patch should fix this problem.
