<P>This info is based on my RedHat 6.1 default KDE Workstation installation.  If you are using 
another distribution, or even another version of RedHat, or a different Workstation install, 
then you may have to do some detective work. Hopefully, this info will give you what you need 
to start detecting! This HOWTO began as the result of wondering how to add another window manager 
or desktop environment to the drop-down list on the GUI login screen; further investigation 
revealed other configuration options.</P>
<P>I began my own "detective work" when I found a reference on a RedHat List which 
mentioned <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>, and its role in system startup.  In 
<CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> I found the following entries, which define how the 
X Window System is started in my distribution and version:</P>

<P>No changes to prefdm are necessary; it determines which display manager is the 
system default, and which runs the GUI login. During boot-up, prefdm parses
<CODE>/etc/sysconfig/desktop</CODE>  and selects the display manager listed there;
in the case of my KDE Workstation  install, this is kdm (KDE Display Manager).
Note that gdm (Gnome Display Manager)    is not installed on my system; xdm (X
Display Manager) is installed by default as  part of the X Window System, and
was apparently used by older versions of Red Hat.  </P>

<P>WARNING:  The procedures explained in this HOWTO involve making changes to system 
configuration files; if you are not experienced in making such changes, some 
caution is required.  Introducing errors into such files may make your system 
unstable, or cause it to crash.  The procedures explained in this HOWTO have 
been tested and should not cause problems if used correctly.</P>
<P>If you have KDE 2.2 or higher, and you are not comfortable with manual editing of system files, you may open a
terminal window (xterm or konsole) from your user desktop (NOT the root
desktop), then type and enter:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
su -c 'kcontrol'
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Enter your root password at the prompt, and make the changes from within the
KDE Control Center that appears: go to <EM>Applications ==> Login Manager</EM>.  Choose
the appropriate configuration tab; you can easily configure every aspect of
the login screen from there.  In Earlier versions of KDE, kcontrol can modify 
kdmrc, but cannot modify Xsession which is used in those versions; see the 
note below about changes from KDE 2.2 and higher.</P>
<P>To see how to manually configure some of these, and see what these
configuration files do, proceed as follows:</P>
<P>(Caution:   Some configuration files have changed since the version of kdm
I'm using, particularly since KDE > 2.0:</P>
<P>The following is quoted from 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/x11-wm.html">the FreeBSD  Handbook-X11:</A></P>
<P>"Note:
In KDE 2.2 this has changed: kdm now uses its own configuration files.  Please
see the KDE 2.2 documentation for details.")</P>
<P>Note:
KDE 3.1 has added kdm documentation, see 
<A HREF="http://docs.kde.org/en/3.1/kdebase/kdm/">The kdm Handbook</A></P>
<P>Much of the material in this new handbook applies to the older versions; 
new features are also described therein.</P>
<P>Check the documentation for your version to identify the current configuration
files if you want to manually edit these, or just want to see how they work.  </P>

<P>Do <EM>not</EM> use a <EM>word-processor</EM> program for editing system configuration 
files; such programs introduce special formatting characters which will corrupt the files.  
Use a <EM>text-editor</EM>, particularly one which can handle long lines without introducing 
extra carriage-return or line feed characters into existing code.  Suitable editors include 
vim (vi improved), vi, and emacs.  There are others, but these are usually installed by default 
in Linux workstation installations; they each have features which make them especially suitable for 
writing and editing computer code.  See the bibliography section at the end of this HOWTO for 
more information.  </P>
<P>IMPORTANT:  Before making changes to <EM>any</EM> system configuration files, you should make 
back-up copies of the originals, so you can restore them in case of serious errors!</P>
<P>The files which we will be changing here are <CODE>/usr/share/config/kdmrc</CODE>, which 
is where we add selection labels to the drop-down list on the login screen, and
<CODE>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</CODE>, which is where we add the path to the executables 
for our labels (if you are using a different distribution, the path to these 
files may be different; just do "<CODE>locate kdmrc</CODE>" and "<CODE>locate Xsession</CODE>" 
in the shell [i.e., in a terminal emulation, such as <EM>xterm</EM>, or KDE's <EM>konsole</EM>] 
to find them). </P>
<P>The default line to change in kdmrc looks like this: </P>

Notice the positions where I have added the labels for the new window managers; all
entries will appear on the drop-down list in the same order as they
appear in the SessionTypes list. Next, the actual choosing takes place in
<CODE>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</CODE>. Here is what the appropriate section of
Xsession  looks like before adding the new entries:</P>

<P>Here is what this section of the Xsession file looks like after adding the new
entries (NOTE that the selection  labels <EM>must</EM> be <EM>exactly</EM> the
same in Xsession and prefdm, i.e., spelling and case  must be identical):</P>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that when the executables are installed in one of the paths shown below, only the 
executable name is required after "exec"; otherwise the full path must be included, 
as shown for "Xclients.anotherlevel" (above): </P>
<P><CODE>/usr/bin/</CODE> </P>
<P><CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE> </P>
<P><CODE>/usr/X11R6/bin/</CODE></P>
<P><CODE>/usr/bin/X11/</CODE></P>
<P>These examples should be enough for you to add your favorite window manager(s) to the 
KDE graphical login, or to give you a starting point to find out how it's done in your 
particular installation. </P>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="KDE-GUI-Login-Configuration-HOWTO.html#toc4">Enabling user selection icons in the login dialog box</A></H2>

<P>In RedHat 6.1, the default KDE login window shows a dialog box with a space to 
type in the user name, one in which to type the user password, and a drop down 
list to select the window manager/desktop environment  of choice.  By making the 
following changes to <CODE>/usr/share/config/kdmrc</CODE>, user icons will appear in 
the top of the login box.  
Here is what the default lines that control user icon view  in kdmrc look like (other 
lines between these two are not shown, and are represented by "..."):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#Users=root;johndoe
...
UserView=false
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Here are the same lines after editing; delete the comment character ("#") in 
front of "Users=..." and change "johndoe" to your username (if there are more 
user accounts on your system, you may add their usernames here, separated by semi-colons 
as shown).  Change "UserView=false" to "UserView=true" as shown here:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
Users=root;johnpipe
...
UserView=true
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now, when you login, you may click on an icon with the mouse to enter the user name; you must still type in your password.</P>
<P>You can add your own icons in place of the default icons; place you own icons 
in /usr/share/apps/kdm/pics/users/.  They should be of size 64 x 64, according 
to the kdm handbook; in KDE 1.x, the default icons are 62 x 63, and my new user icon is 60 
x 60, so if icons are reasonably close to the specified 64 x 64 size, they 
will work OK.  The handbook says "kdm is able to handle icons of different 
sizes, but the result looks messy.", so there is evidently some leeway here. 
Your icons should be named 'username.xpm', for example my username is 
"johnpipe" and my new icon is named 'johnpipe.xpm' </P>
<P>NOTE: at some time since kde 1.x, the icon format has been changed from '.xpm' 
(XPixMap) to '.png' (portable network graphic).</P>

<H2><A NAME="s5">5.</A> <A HREF="KDE-GUI-Login-Configuration-HOWTO.html#toc5">Requiring root permission for shutdown</A></H2>

<P>The default for the shutdown button on the login box allows anyone to use it to shutdown the system. 
The section in <CODE>/usr/share/config/kdmrc</CODE>  controlling who may use this button looks like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#ShutdownButton=RootOnly
ShutdownButton=ConsoleOnly 
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To enable only the root user to shutdown the system, change the lines as shown below:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
ShutdownButton=RootOnly
#ShutdownButton=ConsoleOnly
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 </P>
<P>Clicking the shutdown button will now prompt for the root password before shutting down the 
system.</P>
