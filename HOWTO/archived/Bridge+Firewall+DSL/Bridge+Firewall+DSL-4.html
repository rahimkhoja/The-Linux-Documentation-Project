<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Odd message when using <B>ipchains -X</B></A>
 </H2>

<P> The patch to add the bridgein built-in rule to ipchains makes the "delete all chains"
command, <B>ipchains -X</B>, issue the following error:
<P>
<PRE>
 ipchains: Device or resource busy
 
</PRE>
<P> As far as I can tell this is harmless. I suspect that ipchains does not
understand that the new bridgein rule is a builtin.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Shared Interrupts</A>
 </H2>

<P>As I mentioned in 
<A HREF="Bridge+Firewall+DSL-3.html#Hardware Setup">Hardware Setup</A>, at least for PCI NIC's
you do not want to share interrupts between the two cards (or probably with any other device).
