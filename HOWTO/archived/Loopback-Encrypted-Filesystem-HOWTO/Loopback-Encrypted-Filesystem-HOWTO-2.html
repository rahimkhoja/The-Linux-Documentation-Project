<P>The process uses the device '/dev/loop*' (where * can be 0-7 on
most installations) to mount a loopback filesystem.  The same
process can be used without encryption to store a linux
filesystem on a non-linux partition.  There is a HOWTO on this at
the LDP site mentioned previously.
<P>Different types of encryption can be used, including XOR, DES,
twofish, blowfish, cast128, serpent, MARS, RC6, DFC, and IDEA.
The program 'losetup' (loopback setup) is what associates your
encrypted file with a filesystem and it's cipher type.  According
to Alexander
Kjeldaas, who maintains kerneli.org and the international crypto
patches, DES
and losetup are currently incompatible.  This is due to
differences in the way
the two handle parity bits.  There are no plans to support DES as
it is much
more insecure than the other ciphers.  
<P>Twofish, blowfish, cast128, and serpent are all licensed free for
any use. 
The others may or may not have licensing restrictions.  Several
of them are
candidates for the AES standard.  The finalists will provide
royalty free use
of their ciphers worldwide.
<P>This document uses the serpent algorithm because it is strong yet
remarkably fast, and it's freely distributable under the GPL. 
According to
it's documentation, serpent uses a 128-bit block cipher designed
by Ross
Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen.  It provides users with the
highest
practical level of assurance that no shortcut attacks will be
found.  The
documentation on serpent as well as the source code can be found
at:

<P>Also, this document assumes that the ciphers are compiled
directly into the
kernel.  You may install them as modules, but the technique is
not discussed
in this document.  You will have to edit the file
'/etc/conf.module'; the
process is discussed in detail in the kernel compilation HOWTO
referenced previously.
