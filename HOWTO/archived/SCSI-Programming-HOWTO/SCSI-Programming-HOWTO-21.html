The functions <CODE>open</CODE>, <CODE>ioctl</CODE>, <CODE>write</CODE> and <CODE>read</CODE> 
can report errors. In this case their return value is -1 and the
global variable errno is set to the error number.
The errno values are defined in <CODE>/usr/include/errno.h</CODE>.

+================================================================+

A definition of the status byte codes is given below.

GOOD.  This status indicates that the target has successfully completed the
command.

CHECK CONDITION.  This status indicates that a contingent allegiance condition
has occurred (see 6.6).

CONDITION MET.  This status or INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET is returned whenever
the requested operation is satisfied (see the SEARCH DATA and PRE-FETCH
commands).

BUSY.  This status indicates that the target is busy.  This status shall be
returned whenever a target is unable to accept a command from an otherwise
acceptable initiator (i.e., no reservation conflicts).  The recommended
initiator recovery action is to issue the command again at a later time.

INTERMEDIATE.  This status or INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET shall be returned for
every successfully completed command in a series of linked commands (except
the last command), unless the command is terminated with CHECK CONDITION,
RESERVATION CONFLICT, or COMMAND TERMINATED status.  If INTERMEDIATE or
INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET status is not returned, the series of linked
commands is terminated and the I/O process is ended.

INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET.  This status is the combination of the CONDITION
MET and INTERMEDIATE statuses.

RESERVATION CONFLICT.  This status shall be returned whenever an initiator
attempts to access a logical unit or an extent within a logical unit that is
reserved with a conflicting reservation type for another SCSI device (see the
RESERVE and RESERVE UNIT commands).  The recommended initiator recovery action
is to issue the command again at a later time.

COMMAND TERMINATED.  This status shall be returned whenever the target
terminates the current I/O process after receiving a TERMINATE I/O PROCESS
message (see 5.6.22).  This status also indicates that a contingent allegiance
condition has occurred (see 6.6).

QUEUE FULL.  This status shall be implemented if tagged queuing is
implemented.  This status is returned when a SIMPLE QUEUE TAG, ORDERED QUEUE
TAG, or HEAD OF QUEUE TAG message is received and the command queue is full.
The I/O process is not placed in the command queue.

|--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   0h   |  NO SENSE.  Indicates that there is no specific sense key          |
|        |  information to be reported for the designated logical unit.  This |
|        |  would be the case for a successful command or a command that      |
|        |  received CHECK CONDITION or COMMAND TERMINATED status because one |
|        |  of the filemark, EOM, or ILI bits is set to one.                  |
|--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1h   |  RECOVERED ERROR.  Indicates that the last command completed       |
|        |  successfully with some recovery action performed by the target.   |
|        |  Details may be determinable by examining the additional sense     |
|        |  bytes and the information field.  When multiple recovered errors  |
|        |  occur during one command, the choice of which error to report     |
|        |  (first, last, most severe, etc.) is device specific.              |

|--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   3h   |  MEDIUM ERROR.  Indicates that the command terminated with a non-  |
|        |  recovered error condition that was probably caused by a flaw in   |
|        |  the medium or an error in the recorded data.  This sense key may  |
|        |  also be returned if the target is unable to distinguish between a |
|        |  flaw in the medium and a specific hardware failure (sense key 4h).|
|--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   4h   |  HARDWARE ERROR.  Indicates that the target detected a non-        |
|        |  recoverable hardware failure (for example, controller failure,    |
|        |  device failure, parity error, etc.) while performing the command  |

|        |  the command descriptor block or in the additional parameters      |
|        |  supplied as data for some commands (FORMAT UNIT, SEARCH DATA,     |
|        |  etc.).  If the target detects an invalid parameter in the command |
|        |  descriptor block, then it shall terminate the command without     |
|        |  altering the medium.  If the target detects an invalid parameter  |
|        |  in the additional parameters supplied as data, then the target may|
|        |  have already altered the medium.  This sense key may also indicate|
|        |  that an invalid IDENTIFY message was received (5.6.7).            |
|--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   6h   |  UNIT ATTENTION.  Indicates that the removable medium may have been|
|        |  changed or the target has been reset.  See 6.9 for more detailed  |
|        |  information about the unit attention condition.                   |
|--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   7h   |  DATA PROTECT.  Indicates that a command that reads or writes the  |
|        |  medium was attempted on a block that is protected from this       |
|        |  operation.  The read or write operation is not performed.         |

|        |  access device encountered blank medium or format-defined end-of-  |
|        |  data indication while reading or a write-once device encountered a|

|        |  device, the destination device, or both.  (See 7.2.3.2 for        |

The midlevel driver categorizes the returned status from the lowlevel
driver based on the sense key from the device. It suggests some actions
to be taken such as retry, abort or remap. The routine scsi_done from
scsi.c does a very differentiated handling based on host_byte(),
status_byte(), msg_byte() and the suggestion. It then sets the driver
byte to show what it has done. The driver byte is composed out of two
nibbles: the driver status and the suggestion. Each half is composed
from the below values being 'or'ed together (found in scsi.h).
