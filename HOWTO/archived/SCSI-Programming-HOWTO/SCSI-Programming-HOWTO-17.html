<P>In Linux there is also another SCSI access method via 
SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl calls, which is deprecated.
Special tools like 'scsiinfo' utilize it.
<P>
<P>There are some other similar interfaces in use in the un*x world, but
not available for Linux:
<OL>
<LI>CAM (Common Access Method) developed by Future Domain and other
SCSI vendors. Linux has little support for a SCSI CAM system yet
(mainly for booting from hard disk).
CAM even supports target mode, so one could disguise ones computer
as a peripheral hardware device (e.g. for a small SCSI net).</LI>
<LI>ASPI (Advanced SCSI Programming Interface) developed by Adaptec.
This is the de facto standard for MS-DOS machines.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There are other application interfaces from SCO(TM), NeXT(TM), Silicon
Graphics(TM) and SUN(TM) as well.
