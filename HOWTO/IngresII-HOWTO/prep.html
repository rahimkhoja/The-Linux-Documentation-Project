	larger.</P
><P

	The method of doing this is described in the
	<I

	A database, on the other hand, consists of files of different types.
	These are:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Control file: it stores certain basic information about the
			database.
			You can see this information with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>infodb</B
>
			command after you have completed the installation.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Data files: every system table, user table, and also every
			index goes in a separate file.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Checkpoint files: checkpoint is the term
			<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ingres</SPAN
> uses for a database backup.
			A backup can consist of more than file.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Dump files: online backups are possible in
			<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ingres</SPAN
>, that is, the database may be in
			use while the backup program is running.
			For this reason, the database may change while it is being checkpointed.
			<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ingres</SPAN
>, so that it can restore the database
			to the state it was in at the <EM
>beginning</EM
> of
			the backup, saves the before images of those data blocks (pages)
			that have changed during the backup process.
			These pages are saved in the dump files.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Journal files: from time to time,
			<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ingres</SPAN
> writes the records of committed
			transactions from the log file to
			journal files (at least, this is the default behavior: journalling may
			be set off at the database or table level).
			The frequency of the journalling activity is a tunable function of the
			amount of information that is written to the transaction log.
			Journalling protects the installation against media failures:
			if the disk containing the database crashes, you can restore
			the last (just before the failure occurred) committed state
			of the database using a backup (checkpoint) of the database
			and the journals created after that checkpoint was taken.
			If you lose the log disk, you can restore the last committed
			state the database was in at the time the last journal file
			was written.</P

	These directories are specified indirectly, by means of

><P
>There are five location types:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Data location: place for data files of a database.
			A database can have more than one data location (adding data locations
			to a database is called <EM
>extending</EM
> the database).
			However, every database has a <EM
>primary</EM
> data
			location.
			The system tables and the control file always reside in the primary
			location.
			When creating a table, if you do not specify the location(s) to put
			it in, it will be placed in the primary data location of the
			database.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Checkpoint location: by default, backups are created here.
			Not necessarily, however: the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ckpdb</B
> command
			allows you to specify an arbitrary place for the backup, this way you
			can checkpoint a database directly to tape as well.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Dump location: for dump files.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Journal location: this is where the journal files for a
			database reside.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Work location: <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ingres</SPAN

			temporary sort files in this location.
			Just like with data locations, a database may have more than one
			work location.
			If this is the case, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ingres</SPAN

			uses all of them for each sort operation.</P
