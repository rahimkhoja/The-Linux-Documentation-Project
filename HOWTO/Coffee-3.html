<P>The concept is that we take a controling voltage from the computer,
which drives an electrically isolated circuit with a Relay or Triac.
<P>
<P>You must choose a Relay circuit, if you have a coffee-machine
greater than 200W. You can use a triac-based one if your coffee machine isn't high power.
<P>All circuits presented are tested, but the results and risks are
YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.
If you have no experience with electronics you should NOT try
building it on these, otherwise you may get a bad one...
<P>
<P>You should be very careful while experimenting with 220V, 
and using an appropriate fuse is absolutely advisable.

<P>Here is a simple example to get a voltage 0-5V from the parallel
port of the computer.

Connect Vcc with the same voltage as the relay type (usually 5 or 12V).
Obviously, the relay's specifications should be scaled for your
coffee-machine.
<P>Barmen, tend to put the relay AFTER the transistor, at the
emitter (E) pin instead of the collector (C) pin. This is bad practice
because it biases the transistor badly, and might result in bad coffee :-).
Diode 1N4002 is useful to protect the transistor from the relay's currents. 
If you don't use it the transistor will sooner become dark and smelly... 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Controlling with TRIAC #1</A>
</H2>

<P>If you only want a simple circuit, you can use Motorola's 
triac driver MOC301[012], together with a general purpose TRIAC like SC141D.
This method has the advantage that you don't need any extra power supply.
<P>
<P>For non-inductive loads, this is the circuitry:

<P>If you are going to work with 220V, try to obtain a 3021.
Inductive loads should be used in conjuction with bypass capacitors,
better consult <EM>Motorola Application Note AN-780</EM>.
Coffee-machines are mainly resistive loads and not inductive (like a motor), but who knows what yours is?

<P>Circuit description:
<P>The MC3032 is an optoisolator TRIAC driver. 
The 180-ohm resistor sets the current for the LED emitter in the optoisolator. 
Change the value of this resistor - if necessary - to get a reasonable current 
(e.g., 15 mA).
<P>Note that you cannot test this circuit without a load.
The TRIAC will not switch unless connected to an AC
voltage source, so you can't test it for simple switching without applying AC 
and a load. Note the 500V rating on the .01 capacitor.
