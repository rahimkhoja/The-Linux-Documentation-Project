>5. How Video Displays Work</H1
><P
>Knowing how the
display works is
essential to understanding what numbers to put in the various fields
in the file Xconfig.  Those values are used in the lowest levels of
controlling the display by the X server.</P
><P
>The display generates a picture from what you could consider to be a
series of raster dots. The dots are arranged from left to right to form
lines.  The lines are arranged from top to bottom to form the picture.
The dots emit light when they are struck by the electron beams inside
the display, one for each primary color.  To make the beams strike
each dot for an equal amount of time, the beams are swept across the
display in a constant pattern, called a raster.</P
><P
>We say "what you could consider to be a series of dots" because
these raster dots don't actually correspond to physical phosphor dots.
The physical phosphor dots are much smaller than raster dots -- they
have to be, otherwise the display would suffer from severe
moiré-pattern effects.  The raster dots are really samples of
the analog driver signal, and display as a grid of dots only because
the peaks and valleys in the signal are quite regularly and finely
spaced.</P
><P
>The pattern starts at the top left of the screen, goes across
the screen to the right in a straight line, moving ever so slightly
"downhill" (the downhill slope is too small to be perceptible). Then
the beams are swept back to the left side of the display, starting at
a new line.  The new line is swept from left to right just as the
first line was.  This pattern is repeated until the bottom line on the
display has been swept.  Then the beams are moved from the bottom
right corner of the display (sweeping back and forth a few times) to
the top left corner, and the pattern is started over again.</P
><P
>There is one variation of this scheme known as
interlacing: here
only every second line is swept during one half-frame and the others
are filled in during a second half-frame.</P
><P
>Starting the beams at the top left of the display is called the
beginning of a frame.  The frame ends when the beams reach the the top
left corner again as they come from the bottom right corner of the
display.  A frame is made up of all of the lines the beams traced from
the top of the display to the bottom.</P
><P
>If the electron beams were on all of the time they were sweeping
through the frame, all of the dots on the display would be
illuminated.  There would be no black border around the edges of the
display.  At the edges of the display the picture would become
distorted because the beams are hard to control there.  To reduce the
distortion, the dots around the edges of the display are not
illuminated by the beams (because they're turned off) even though the
beams, if they were turned on, would be pointing at them.  The
viewable area of the display is reduced this way.</P
><P
>Another important thing to understand is what becomes of the beams
when no spot is being painted on the visible area.  The time the beams
would have been illuminating the side borders of the display is used
for sweeping the beams back from the right edge to the left. The time
the beams would have been illuminating the top and bottom borders of
the display is used for moving the beams from the bottom-right corner
of the display to the top-left corner.</P
><P
>The adapter card generates the signals which cause the display to turn
on the electron beams (according to the desired color) at each dot to
generate a picture. The card also controls when the display moves the
beams from the right side back to the left by generating a signal
called the horizontal sync (for synchronization) pulse.  One
horizontal sync pulse occurs at the end of every line.  The adapter
also generates a vertical sync pulse which signals the display to move
the beams to the top-left corner of the display.  A vertical sync
pulse is generated near the end of every frame.</P
><P
>The display requires that there be short time periods both before and
after the horizontal and vertical sync pulses so that the position of
the electron beams can stabilize.  If the beams can't stabilize, the
picture will not be steady.</P
