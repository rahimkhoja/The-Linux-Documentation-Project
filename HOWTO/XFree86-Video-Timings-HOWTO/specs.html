interlaced) are actually the half-frame rates: an entire screen seems
to have about that flicker frequency for typical displays, but every
single line is refreshed only half as often.</P

>For calculation purposes we reckon an interlaced display at its
full-frame (refresh) rate, i.e. 43.5Hz. The quality of an interlaced
mode is better than that of a non-interlaced mode with the same
full-frame rate, but definitely worse than the non-interlaced one
corresponding to the half-frame rate.</P

>7.1. About Bandwidth</H2
><P
>Monitor makers like to advertise high bandwidth because it
constrains the sharpness of intensity and color changes on the screen.
A high bandwidth means smaller visible details.</P
><P
>Your monitor uses electronic signals to present an image to your
eyes.  Such signals always come in in wave form once they are
converted into analog form from digitized form.  They can be
considered as combinations of many simpler wave forms each one of
which has a fixed frequency, many of them are in the Mhz range, eg,
20Mhz, 40Mhz, or even 70Mhz.  Your monitor video bandwidth is,
effectively, the highest-frequency analog signal it can handle without
distortion.</P
><P
>For our purposes, video bandwidth is mainly important as an approximate
cutoff point for the highest dot clock you can use.</P

>7.2. Sync Frequencies and the Refresh Rate:</H2
><P
>Each horizontal scan line on the display is just the visible
portion of a frame-length scan.  At any instant there is actually only
one dot active on the screen, but with a fast enough refresh rate your
eye's persistence of vision enables you to "see" the whole
image.</P

>Remember that the actual raster scan is a very tight zigzag
pattern; that is, the beam moves left-right and at the same time
up-down.</P
><P
>Now we can see how the dot clock and frame size relates to
refresh rate.  By definition, one hertz (hz) is one cycle per second.
So, if your horizontal frame length is HFL and your vertical frame
length is VFL, then to cover the entire screen takes (HFL * VFL)
ticks.  Since your card emits DCF ticks per second by definition, then
obviously your monitor's electron gun(s) can sweep the screen from
left to right and back and from bottom to top and back DCF / (HFL *
VFL) times/sec.  This is your screen's refresh rate, because it's how
many times your screen can be updated (thus
<EM
>refreshed</EM
>) per second! </P
><P
>You need to understand this concept to design a configuration
which trades off resolution against flicker in whatever way suits your
needs.</P

>This is a generic monitor mode diagram.  The x axis of the diagram
shows the clock rate (DCF), the y axis represents the refresh rate
(RR). The filled region of the diagram describes the monitor's
capabilities: every point within this region is a possible video
mode.</P

>The lines labeled `R1' and `R2' represent a fixed resolutions
(such as 640x480); they are meant to illustrate how one resolution can
be realized by many different combinations of dot clock and refresh
rate. The R2 line would represent a higher resolution than R1.</P
><P
>The top and bottom boundaries of the permitted region are simply
horizontal lines representing the limiting values for the vertical sync
frequency. The video bandwidth is an upper limit to the clock rate and
hence is represented by a vertical line bounding the capability region on
the right.</P

>Under <A

diagram like this (but much nicer, with X graphics) for your
individual monitor.  That section also discusses the interesting part;
the derivation of the boundaries resulting from the limits on the
horizontal sync frequency.</P
