CLASS="QUOTE"

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"115200"</SPAN

You can find valid speed settings in the termios manual page, although your hardware will limit the baud rate. Choosing an invalid speed setting will elicit an error message from the pppd daemon and apparently it then reverts to some default value.

>    Note that <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"login"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"/etc/ppp/options"</SPAN
>, or you will be asking your ISP to authorize itself when you dial in and that probably won't succeed. The reason why they are not specified in this file by default is because if you have other incoming PPP connections now or in the future, you want to make sure they are always authenticated. Remember that the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pap-secrets"</SPAN
> as presented here gives zero protection.
   </P
><P
>    Finally, the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ppp_laplink_server:ppp_laplink_client"</SPAN
> entry specifies the local and remote IP address after the link is up. You can use actual IP numbers here (e.g. 192.168.0.1:192.168.1.1), or entries from the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"/etc/hosts"</SPAN
> file, like I have done. The nice thing of doing the latter is that you can use the names to refer to these links later. I also recommend you use IP numbers like the ones I used (192.168.0.1:192.168.1.1). These addresses are set aside for local networks and don't exist on the internet, so you are avoiding possible conflicts. After the link is up, the client can refer to the server with the IP address of ppp_laplink_server (192.168.0.1) and the server refers to the client with ppp_laplink_client (192.168.1.1).
   </P

>    You could use different entries in <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"/etc/ppp/pap-secrets"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
