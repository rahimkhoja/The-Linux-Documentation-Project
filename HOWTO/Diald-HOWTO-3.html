<P>
<P>In a few words, <EM>Diald</EM> creates a new network interface and sets it as
the default gateway. This interface is not real (in the original
documentation it is called <CODE>proxy interface</CODE>). <EM>Diald</EM> monitors this
interface, and, when packets arrive, makes a <CODE>ppp</CODE> connection, waits
for it to be stablished and changes the default gateway to this new
<CODE>ppp</CODE> interface (usually <CODE>ppp0</CODE>).
<P><EM>Diald</EM> monitors the interface to determine which packets have been
received the interface and their types to decide if they are going to be
considered to set the <CODE>ppp</CODE> connection up, maintain the link, drop it
or do nothing, and how long the link should be help up after the packet is
transmitted.
<P>Finally, if there is no more traffic and the last packet up time is over,
<EM>Diald</EM> will close the link.
<P>You can control days and hours when the link can go up and when it cannot,
so you can use the low cost hours/days or low trafic times.
<P>This previous description is valid for <EM>Diald</EM> versions from 0.16.5 to
latest (0.99.3 when this document was finished), but latest versions also
include aditional attributes such as user enabled list, advanced
accounting, better support for ISDN lines, better performance using an
<CODE>ethertap</CODE> device as proxy (this is like a network interface that
read/writes over a socket instead of a real network adapter) in place of
<CODE>slip</CODE>, backup connections and other functions.
