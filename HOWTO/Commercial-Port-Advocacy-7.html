Dear Sir or Madam:

If I've sent this to the wrong address in your
organization, I
apologize; could you please forward it to the appropriate
person?  Also, could you let me know who that appropriate person
is
so I can direct future communications to him or her?  Thank
you.

I know that [insert company name here] has fine
educational
software programs for both the Macintosh and Windows PCs.
However, I'd like to speak on behalf of a computer community that
has heretofore been overlooked by the entire educational software
industry; the Linux community.  I'd also like to call your
attention to porting tools that can make moving Windows and
especially Macintosh software to Linux nearly trivial.

Linux is the fastest growing operating system in the world. It is impossible to put
exact numbers on how quickly it is growing because it can be downloaded for free
off of the internet. The last attempt to estimate the total user base in early 1998
came up with &nbsp;7 million users world-wide in early 1998 with over 100%
growth/year. The explosion of Linux publicity since then has undoubtedly kept that
growth rate alive, putting the current market at around 20 million with rapid
expansion for some time to come.   
That's more than the worldwide total of OS/2 users and is near
(if not more than) the number of Macintosh users.  In addition,
these numbers should probably be in some part subtracted from the
Windows and Macintosh user figures, as almost all of the
computers Linux is used on initially had Windows or MacOS
installed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just who are these Linux users?  They are primarily male,
technically educated, and in their early twenties.  The first two
traits are more standard than the last; Linux users range from
the teens to probably the mid-40s in age.  (I'm 46, so I had to
extend the range at least that far.)  This is a prime demographic
for the educational software market.  These are people who
generally have or will soon move into well-paying jobs in
technical fields, and who are often just starting families.
Linux users are usually not very patient with MacOS or Windows,
and so tend not to see or to consider software offerings for
those operating systems.

To the best of my knowledge, there are currently
<EM>zero</EM>
educational software programs available for Linux.  While many
Linux users will write their own programs if they can't find
anything to fit their needs, that has so far not been the case
with educational software.  This may be because Linux only
originated in 1991, and has only experienced explosive growth in
the last 2-3 years.  The market is completely open.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This has only recently been noticed by the Linux
community.
As more of us have young children, the awareness of the need for
educational software for Linux is growing.  I'm sure it will only
be a matter of time till someone begins to address this
need.

What is the easiest, most cost-effective way to enter this
market?  It's certainly not impossible to start from source code
and rewrite the operating-system-specific routines to work with
Linux.  That's what many Macintosh ISVs did when they wanted to
enter the Windows market.  However, there are easier
ways.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are "wrapper" programs available for both Windows
and
Macintosh programs, which enable them to run on Linux without
having to be rewritten extensively.  For Windows, there is the
TWIN library from Willows Software
&lt;http://www.willows.com&gt;.  I
don't have any direct experience with TWIN, but the Willows
website gets quite specific on what Windows routines move across
cleanly and what ones need some touch up.  The WINE Project
(&lt;http://www.winehq.com&gt;) also has Winelib, a similar set
of libraries that Corel is planning to help develop and use in
porting its office applications to Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For Macintosh programs, Abacus Research &amp; Development,
Inc.
(ARDI &lt;http://www.ardi.com/&gt;) has rewritten a substantial
fraction of the Macintosh OS and toolbox routines, and makes this
technology available in two different ways.  Executor is
available both as a Macintosh emulator for end-users and as a
porting tool for Mac ISVs.  Executor is available for Linux, DOS
and Windows.  A demo of Executor for Linux is included on the Red
Hat 5.1 Linux distribution, the most popular commercial
distribution.  The engineers at ARDI are fluent in Macintosh and
Linux and can evaluate how hard it would be to make a Linux
version of your Macintosh software.  In many cases it can be done
without your needing to change a single line of code.  A Linux
version of your program created in this way can easily fit on the
same CD-ROM as your Mac and Windows executables, thereby giving
you a three-OS program on one SKU.  The expenditure required to
open up this potentially lucrative new market is relatively
minor; certainly much lower than the cost of the ports many
companies made in expanding from the Mac-only market into the
Windows and Mac market.

Finally, a personal note.  The reason I'm moved to write
to
you proposing that you enter the Linux educational software
market is my 6-year-old son.  I run Linux because, of all the
operating system choices available, it best fills my needs and
desires.
If there were good educational software available for Linux, I'd
snap it up.  I know I'm not alone; I've heard from other parents
every time I've mentioned the problem in various Linux forums.
There's a market out here waiting to buy your product.  Please
don't disappoint us.
