<LI><B>Q</B>:
What is the best way to configure Software RAID?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
I keep rediscovering that file-system planning is one 
of the more difficult Unix configuration tasks.
To answer your question, I can describe what we did.

We planned the following setup:
<UL>
<LI>two EIDE disks, 2.1.gig each.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
disk partition mount pt.  size    device
  1      1       /        300M   /dev/hda1
  1      2       swap      64M   /dev/hda2
  1      3       /home    800M   /dev/hda3
  1      4       /var     900M   /dev/hda4

  2      1       /root    300M   /dev/hdc1
  2      2       swap      64M   /dev/hdc2
  2      3       /home    800M   /dev/hdc3
  2      4       /var     900M   /dev/hdc4
                    
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Each disk is on a separate controller (&amp; ribbon cable).
The theory is that a controller failure and/or
ribbon failure won't disable both disks.
Also, we might possibly get a performance boost 
from parallel operations over two controllers/cables.
</LI>
<LI>Install the Linux kernel on the root (<CODE>/</CODE>)
partition <CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE>.  Mark this partition as
bootable.
</LI>
<LI><CODE>/dev/hdc1</CODE> will contain a ``cold'' copy of
<CODE>/dev/hda1</CODE>. This is NOT a raid copy,
just a plain old copy-copy. It's there just in 
case the first disk fails; we can use a rescue disk,
mark <CODE>/dev/hdc1</CODE> as bootable, and use that to 
keep going without having to reinstall the system.
You may even want to put <CODE>/dev/hdc1</CODE>'s copy
of the kernel into LILO to simplify booting in case of
failure.

The theory here is that in case of severe failure,
I can still boot the system without worrying about
raid superblock-corruption or other raid failure modes
&amp; gotchas that I don't understand.
</LI>
<LI><CODE>/dev/hda3</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/hdc3</CODE> will be mirrors
<CODE>/dev/md0</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/dev/hda4</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/hdc4</CODE> will be mirrors
<CODE>/dev/md1</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>we picked <CODE>/var</CODE> and <CODE>/home</CODE> to be mirrored,
and in separate partitions, using the following logic:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>/</CODE> (the root partition) will contain 
relatively static, non-changing data:
for all practical purposes, it will be 
read-only without actually being marked &amp;
mounted read-only.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/home</CODE> will contain ''slowly'' changing 
data.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/var</CODE> will contain rapidly changing data,
including mail spools, database contents and
web server logs.</LI>
</UL>

The idea behind using multiple, distinct partitions is
that <B>if</B>, for some bizarre reason,
whether it is human error, power loss, or an operating
system gone wild, corruption is limited to one partition.
In one typical case, power is lost while the
system is writing to disk.  This will almost certainly
lead to a corrupted filesystem, which will be repaired
by <CODE>fsck</CODE> during the next boot.  Although 
<CODE>fsck</CODE> does it's best to make the repairs 
without creating additional damage during those repairs, 
it can be comforting to know that any such damage has been
limited to one partition.  In another typical case,
the sysadmin makes a mistake during rescue operations,
leading to erased or destroyed data.  Partitions can 
help limit the repercussions of the operator's errors.</LI>
<LI>Other reasonable choices for partitions might be 
<CODE>/usr</CODE> or <CODE>/opt</CODE>.  In fact, <CODE>/opt</CODE>
and <CODE>/home</CODE> make great choices for RAID-5 
partitions, if we had more disks.  A word of caution:
<B>DO NOT</B> put <CODE>/usr</CODE> in a RAID-5
partition.  If a serious fault occurs, you may find
that you cannot mount <CODE>/usr</CODE>, and that
you want some of the tools on it (e.g. the networking
tools, or the compiler.)  With RAID-1, if a fault has
occurred, and you can't get RAID to work, you can at
least mount one of the two mirrors.  You can't do this
with any of the other RAID levels (RAID-5, striping, or
linear append).
</LI>
</UL>


<P>So, to complete the answer to the question:
<UL>
<LI>install the OS on disk 1, partition 1.
do NOT mount any of the other partitions. </LI>
<LI>install RAID per instructions. </LI>
<LI>configure <CODE>md0</CODE> and <CODE>md1</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>convince yourself that you know
what to do in case of a disk failure!
Discover sysadmin mistakes now,
and not during an actual crisis.
Experiment!
(we turned off power during disk activity &mdash;
this proved to be ugly but informative).</LI>
<LI>do some ugly mount/copy/unmount/rename/reboot scheme to
move <CODE>/var</CODE> over to the <CODE>/dev/md1</CODE>.
Done carefully, this is not dangerous.</LI>
<LI>enjoy!</LI>

What is the difference between the <CODE>mdadd</CODE>, <CODE>mdrun</CODE>,

commands?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The names of the tools have changed as of the 0.5 release of the

in the 0.43 and older versions, while <CODE>raid</CODE> is used in 
0.5 and newer versions.

<LI><B>Q</B>:
I want to run RAID-linear/RAID-0 in the stock 2.0.34 kernel.
I don't want to apply the raid patches, since these are not 
needed for RAID-0/linear.  Where can I get the raid-tools
to manage this?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
This is a tough question, indeed, as the newest raid tools 
package needs to have the RAID-1,4,5 kernel patches installed 
in order to compile.  I am not aware of any pre-compiled, binary
version of the raid tools that is available at this time.
However, experiments show that the raid-tools binaries, when
compiled against kernel 2.1.100, seem to work just fine
in creating a RAID-0/linear partition under 2.0.34.  A brave
soul has asked for these, and I've <B>temporarily</B>
placed the binaries mdadd, mdcreate, etc. 
at http://linas.org/linux/Software-RAID/
You must get the man pages, etc. from the usual raid-tools 
package.

<LI><B>Q</B>:
Can I strip/mirror the root partition (<CODE>/</CODE>)?
Why can't I boot Linux directly from the <CODE>md</CODE> disks?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Both LILO and Loadlin need an non-stripped/mirrored partition
to read the kernel image from. If you want to strip/mirror
the root partition (<CODE>/</CODE>),
then you'll want to create an unstriped/mirrored partition
to hold the kernel(s).
Typically, this partition is named <CODE>/boot</CODE>.
Then you either use the initial ramdisk support (initrd),
or patches from Harald Hoyer 
&lt;
<A HREF="mailto:HarryH@Royal.Net">HarryH@Royal.Net</A>&gt;
that allow a stripped partition to be used as the root
device.  (These patches are now a standard part of recent
2.1.x kernels)

<P>There are several approaches that can be used.
One approach is documented in detail in the
Bootable RAID mini-HOWTO:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.bizsystems.com/pub/raid/bootable-raid">ftp://ftp.bizsystems.com/pub/raid/bootable-raid</A>.
<P>
<P>Alternately, use <CODE>mkinitrd</CODE> to build the ramdisk image,
see below.

So I have a fairly small kernel. The method is perfectly

<LI>At one time I had partitioned the raid disks so that the initial

(why waste them on boot?).</LI>

<LI>The nice thing about having an inexpensive device dedicated to

It is current enough to show the picture.
It isn't especially pretty and it could certainly build
a much smaller filesystem image for the initial ram disk.
It would be easy to a make it more efficient.
But it uses <CODE>LILO</CODE> as is.

<LI><B>Q</B>:
I have heard that I can run mirroring over striping. Is this true?
Can I run mirroring over the loopback device?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Yes, but not the reverse.  That is, you can put a stripe over 
several disks, and then build a mirror on top of this.  However,
striping cannot be put on top of mirroring.  

<P>A brief technical explanation is that the linear and stripe 
personalities use the <CODE>ll_rw_blk</CODE> routine for access.
The <CODE>ll_rw_blk</CODE> routine 
maps disk devices and  sectors, not blocks.  Block devices can be
layered one on top of the other; but devices that do raw, low-level
disk accesses, such as <CODE>ll_rw_blk</CODE>, cannot.
<P>
<P>Currently (November 1997) RAID cannot be run over the
loopback devices, although this should be fixed shortly.

Currently (November 1997), for a RAID-5 array, no. 
Currently, one can do this only for a RAID-1 on top of the
concatenated drives.

</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
What is the difference between RAID-1 and RAID-5 for a two-disk
configuration (i.e. the difference between a RAID-1 array  built 
out of two disks, and a RAID-5 array built out of two disks)?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
There is no difference in storage capacity.  Nor can disks be 
added to either array to increase capacity (see the question below for
details).
        
<P>RAID-1 offers a performance advantage for reads: the RAID-1
driver uses distributed-read technology to simultaneously read 
two sectors, one from each drive, thus doubling read performance.
<P>
<P>The RAID-5 driver, although it contains many optimizations, does not
currently (September 1997) realize that the parity disk is actually
a mirrored copy of the data disk.  Thus, it serializes data reads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


</LI>
<LI><B>Q</B>:
How can I guard against a two-disk failure?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Some of the RAID algorithms do guard against multiple disk
failures, but these are not currently implemented for Linux.
However, the Linux Software RAID can guard against multiple
disk failures by layering an array on top of an array.  For
example, nine disks can be used to create three raid-5 arrays.
Then these three arrays can in turn be hooked together into
a single RAID-5 array on top.  In fact, this kind of a
configuration will guard against a three-disk failure.  Note that 
a large amount of disk space is ''wasted'' on the redundancy
information.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    For an NxN raid-5 array,
    N=3, 5 out of 9 disks are used for parity (=55%)
    N=4, 7 out of 16 disks
    N=5, 9 out of 25 disks
    ...
    N=9, 17 out of 81 disks (=~20%)
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In general, an MxN array will use M+N-1 disks for parity.
The least amount of space is "wasted" when M=N.
      
<P>Another alternative is to create a RAID-1 array with 
three disks.  Note that since all three disks contain
identical data, that 2/3's of the space is ''wasted''.

I'd like to understand  how it'd be possible to have something

<BLOCKQUOTE>

This can be done by adding lines like the following to 
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</CODE>:

    mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/hda1 /dev/hdc1 || {

Before presenting a more complete and reliable script,
lets review the theory of operation.

Gadi Oxman writes:
In an unclean shutdown, Linux might be in one of the following states:
<UL>
<LI>The in-memory disk cache was in sync with the RAID set when
the unclean shutdown occurred; no data was lost.
</LI>
<LI>The in-memory disk cache was newer than the RAID set contents
when the crash occurred; this results in a corrupted filesystem
and potentially in data loss.
      
This state can be further divided to the following two states:
      
<UL>
<LI>Linux was writing data when the unclean shutdown occurred.</LI>
<LI>Linux was not writing data when the crash occurred.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>


Suppose we were using a RAID-1 array. In (2a), it might happen that
before the crash, a small number of data blocks were successfully 
written only to some of the mirrors, so that on the next reboot, 
the mirrors will no longer contain the same data.
      
If we were to ignore the mirror differences, the raidtools-0.36.3 
read-balancing code
might choose to read the above data blocks from any of the mirrors, 
which will result in inconsistent behavior (for example, the output 
of <CODE>e2fsck -n /dev/md0</CODE> can differ from run to run).
      
<P>Since RAID doesn't protect against unclean shutdowns, usually 
there isn't any ''obviously correct'' way to fix the mirror 
differences and the filesystem corruption.
<P>For example, by default <CODE>ckraid --fix</CODE> will choose 
the first operational mirror and update the other mirrors 
with its contents.  However, depending on the exact timing 
at the crash, the data on another mirror might be more recent, 
and we might want to use it as the source
mirror instead, or perhaps use another method for recovery.
<P>The following script provides one of the more robust 
boot-up sequences.  In particular, it guards against
long, repeated <CODE>ckraid</CODE>'s in the presence
of uncooperative disks, controllers, or controller device
drivers.  Modify it to reflect your config, 
and copy it to <CODE>rc.raid.init</CODE>.  Then invoke 
<CODE>rc.raid.init</CODE> after the root partition has been
fsck'ed and mounted rw, but before the remaining partitions
are fsck'ed.  Make sure the current directory is in the search
path.

In addition to the above, you'll want to create a 
<CODE>rc.raid.halt</CODE> which should look like the following:
<PRE>
    /sbin/mdstop /dev/md0
    /sbin/mdstop /dev/md1
            
</PRE>

Be sure to modify both <CODE>rc.sysinit</CODE> and
<CODE>init.d/halt</CODE> to include this everywhere that
filesystems get unmounted before a halt/reboot.  (Note
that <CODE>rc.sysinit</CODE> unmounts and reboots if <CODE>fsck</CODE>
returned with an error.)

<LI><B>Q</B>:
Can I set up one-half of a RAID-1 mirror with the one disk I have
now, and then later get the other disk and just drop it in?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
With the current tools, no, not in any easy way.  In particular,
you cannot just copy the contents of one disk onto another,
and then pair them up.  This is because the RAID drivers
use glob of space at the end of the partition to store the
superblock.  This decreases the amount of space available to
the file system slightly; if you just naively try to force
a RAID-1 arrangement onto a partition with an existing
filesystem, the
raid superblock will overwrite a portion of the file system
and mangle data.  Since the ext2fs filesystem scatters
files randomly throughput the partition (in order to avoid
fragmentation), there is a very good chance that some file will 
land at the very end of a partition long before the disk is
full.

<P>If you are clever, I suppose you can calculate how much room
the RAID superblock will need, and make your filesystem
slightly smaller, leaving room for it when you add it later.
But then, if you are this clever, you should also be able to
modify the tools to do this automatically for you.
(The tools are not terribly complex).
<P>
<P><B>Note:</B>A careful reader has pointed out that the 
following trick may work; I have not tried or verified this:
Do the <CODE>mkraid</CODE> with <CODE>/dev/null</CODE> as one of the
devices.  Then <CODE>mdadd -r</CODE> with only the single, true
disk (do not mdadd <CODE>/dev/null</CODE>).  The <CODE>mkraid</CODE>
should have successfully built the raid array, while the
mdadd step just forces the system to run in "degraded" mode, 
as if one of the disks had failed.
