<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Outstanding Issues</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Is it possible or wise to start the font server using inetd?
</LI>
<LI>If the remote host running the font server is powered down but later
comes up again, with the font server active, the X terminal may fail to
retrieve its fonts. The font path entry has to be re-entered with the
console menu or xset. Why?
</LI>
<LI>Are the procedures for other models of X terminals roughly similar?
</LI>
<LI>What is the procedure to boot the X terminal using NFS (Network File
System) or RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)?
</LI>
<LI>The following messages appear in the X terminal Console. I am
suspicious that they come from xfree86 extensions to X which are not part
of the X terminal server. Can someone confirm or deny this?
<PRE>
%XSERVER-I-NEWCLIENT, host "localhost" connected with blank authorization
%XSERVER-W-NOEXTENSION, client attempted to use non-existent extension "BIG-REQUESTS"
%XSERVER-W-NOEXTENSION, client attempted to use non-existent extension "XKEYBOARD"
%XSERVER-W-NOEXTENSION, client attempted to use non-existent extension "XFree86-Misc"
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>Could Linux be ported to an X terminal? This is almost a joke
question but Linux is already on some unlikely platforms.
</LI>
