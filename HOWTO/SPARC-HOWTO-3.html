<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Buying a SPARC computer.</A></H2>

<P>
<P>You have decided to buy a SPARC based computer, now you 
can tell what CPU each model sports, but can you tell how that
particuliar model looks like? How its is inside? 
<P>Do not worry, this section will help you on that topic as well as 
providing you with some hints on how to inspect and test the hardware. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Gaigning a visual familiarity with SPARC hardware</A>
</H2>

<P> 
PC hardware is everywhere and usualy one is quite 
familiar with it, this is not exactly the case with SPARC based hardware,
even more when it comes to the innards of a computer. The good news
is that it exists some sites on the web, where you can find pictures
of Sun hardware, with some very detailed shots, thus you should be
able to instantly identify the model and its condition prior to buy it.
The two main site where I usualy go are:
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/">sun </A>In Sun's database, you can find technical data as well as 
picture of some of Sun's product, the pictures are crisp, and the
hardware is always at its best, this is technicaly interesting, in
order to compare brand new hardware and the used one that is usualy 
featured on the two sites below.</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://www.black-cube.net/Sun/">HAL</A> This site features very detailed pictures of a lot of
hardware, from CPU modules to Servers, even mice. </LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.obsolyte.com/sunPICS/">obsolyte</A> This site has different pictures, it is very useful too.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Sun made hardware or clones ?</A>
</H2>

<P>On the one hand, it is very easy to find information on Sun hardware, while it can be
difficult to find it for clone systems on the other hand it should be
more fun to work with exotic hardware.
<P>Clone systems have been or are still manufactured, at least by:
<UL>
<LI>Fujitsu.</LI>
<LI>Toshiba</LI>
<LI>Ross</LI>
<LI>Tadpole/RDI manufactures SPARC based laptops.</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.tsti.com">Tatung</A> is still in the market and sells SBus, PCI cards, and
of course systems up to the UltraSPARC III based 2U and 4U servers.
For more information about tatung's COMPServer and COMPStations, please read
the Tatung's Workstations and Servers sections of this document.
</LI>
<LI>Toshiba, used to manufacture SPARC based laptops:
The AS1000.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Where to buy.</A>
</H2>

<P>Of course if you buy first hand hardware everything should be fine, 
but if you decide to go for second hand hardware, you will have to
decide how you want to buy it, and you should be able to test it by yourself.
<P>Second hand hardware can be brought from Sun as 
refurbished hardware, at auction websites, or in
specialised stores, or directly from companys that upgrade their
hardware.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Checklist</A>
</H2>

<P>When it comes to second hand hardware one has to be as cautious as
possible about the source, and the condition  of that hardware.
<P>For the source of the hardware, if you can track it, it is a very good
point. If you can't track it, it is up to you to decide if you trust
the seller or not ( If the seller cannot give you the reference of the
hardwre and if, obviously he/she is clueless about Sun hardware, you
should switch to condition red ).
<P>Another interesting point is to see if check is accepted as a
payement.
<P>If you can check the hardware before buying it
then first have a general look at it, search for
cracks, for stains; check the connector's pin. If this first
inspection is OK, then ask to see the inside, look for spills, watch
carefuly the connectors, then if it is OK ask to see it running, 
watch carefully boot messages, issue the <CODE>dmesg|more</CODE> 
or if it runs Solaris you can issue the <CODE>more /var/adm/messages</CODE> command,
and also very important listen to your computer, do you hear unusual 
noises? Does it smell OK?. Then enter the OpenBoot by the
<CODE>stop+a</CODE> command and run some tests ( see the OpenBoot section
).
When you have decided to purchase it, it is very important that you
always make sure that the computer you are purchasing is the one
you have tested: always keep an eye on it, do not let someone go to
the backoffice with it for example, do not accept to leave without
your computer.
<P>Then, when you are at home, recheck it as if it was the first time you
see it. 
If it comes with CDROM drive, try to mount/umount a few CDs 
and read them in order to check that device. If there is a floppy disk
read/write/format a few floppys, this should be a good test.
<P>
<P>
<P>Of course, it exists tools to automaticaly test the hardware, but 
usualy you do not have them when you need them, thus the script
below relies only on ressources provided by a Linux base system.
<P>
<P>You should run the following script for three days, basicaly it
is going to use the CDROM, floppy and hard drive, and to reboot 
the computer every 3 hours. This should stress it, 
<P>

<P>Of course you should run this script manualy once in order to know how
much time it requires to complete, this is just an idea on how to
automate things.
