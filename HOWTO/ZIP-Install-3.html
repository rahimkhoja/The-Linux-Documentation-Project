<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Setting up the ZIP disk</A></H2>

<P>(Common for both Red Hat and Slackware distributions.)
Before starting, make sure that you have access to the ZIP  drive;
either by having ppa in the kernel or by having the ppa module
loaded.  One easy way to find this out is by checking dmesg:
<P><B> ==> dmesg</B>
<P>You may have to pipe this to more as dmesg tends to be rather long.
Here's a snip from mine:

then you have SCSI support but the ZIP wasn't found.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Partitioning ZIP disk</A>
</H2>

<P>To partition the ZIP disk, run fdisk:
<P><B> ==> fdisk /dev/sda/</B>
<P>Here is a snap of the partition table I have setup:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
 Disk /dev/sda: 64 heads, 32 sectors, 96 cylinders
 Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 bytes

I decided to use a swap partition since I wanted to be able to use
this with any machine.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Formatting and mounting the ZIP disk</A>
</H2>

<P>After running fdisk, format the new partition:
<P><B> ==> mke2fs -c /dev/sda1</B>
<P>Then, create the swap partition: (15360 blocks as taken from fdisk)
<P><B> ==> mkswap -c /dev/sda2 15360</B>
<P>Last, you'll need to mount the ZIP disk:
<P><B> ==> mount /dev/sda1 /iomega -t ext2</B>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Creating the boot disk</A>
</H2>

<P>Since the ppa version of the ZIP drive isn't a true SCSI device, it
isn't a bootable device and, therefore, requires a boot disk which
has ppa included in the kernel and not as a module.
<P>
<H3>Configuring and making the kernel</H3>

<P>First, you'll need to configure and make a kernel that has ppa
support enabled and not as a loadable module.  In order to get to
the ppa option, select SCSI support:
<P><I> SCSI support (CONFIG_SCSI) [Y/m/n/?] </I>
<P>Plus, SCSI disk support:
<P><I> SCSI disk support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD) [Y/m/n/?] </I>
<P>And finally, under the SCSI low-level drivers, is the ppa support:
<P><I> IOMEGA Parallel Port ZIP drive SCSI support (CONFIG_SCSI_PPA) [Y/m/n/?] </I>
<P>Again, be sure not to include ppa as a module, but rather in the
kernel.  Thus far, without the use of the parport kernel patch
(see 1.4), the ppa driver will not allow the passive port of the ZIP
drive to be used for a printer, so you may want to say no to parallel
printer support:
<P><I> Parallel printer support (CONFIG_PRINTER) [N/y/m/?] </I>
<P>

  NOTE: For more information concerning the ppa driver, please
        refer to the ZIP-Drive mini-HOWTO.
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once the kernel is configured, make the kernel:
<P><B> ==> make dep; make clean; make zImage </B>
<P>The new kernel should be found in arch/i386/boot/zImage.
<P>
<H3>Getting the kernel to a floppy</H3>

<P>After having to have 4 separate floppies due to different kernels
and needing different parameters, (plus the great email I got
telling me how to do this) I have included a section on LILO as one
of the means of creating a bootable floppy.
<P>
<H3>LILO installation</H3>

<P>For those who have to, or for that matter just want to, have several
kernels on one floppy (now adays, mine are too large) or just want
to be able to pass arguments (such as single user mode) I received
email on how to install LILO on a floppy.
<P>
<H3>Creating the ext2 filesystem</H3>

<P>To create an ext2 filesystem on a floppy, just do the same command
for the ZIP disk:
<P><B> ==> mke2fs -t /dev/fd0 </B>
<P>
<H3>Copying the essential files</H3>

<P>Next, make sure there's a directory for a mount point, and mount the
floppy (I used /mnt/floppy):
<P><B> ==> mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy -t ext2 </B>
<P>is to boot properly, you'll need the same files that LILO uses on your
current Linux installation.
<P>

    NOTE: The file locations here are from my machine
          and may not be the same for everyone.

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> ==> cp /boot/boot.b /mnt/floppy </B>
<P><B> ==> cp /boot/map /mnt/floppy </B>
<P><B> ==> cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /mnt/floppy/vmlinuzDESK </B>
<P>
<P>Now to create the config file for LILO, now I miss the liloconfig
program... (Thanks to Javier Rodriguez for this info) First, create
the LILO config file, /mnt/floppy/lilo.conf, for the kernel(s) for
the ZIP disk.  Here's what I used so that I could have different
kernels to test with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
boot=/dev/fd0
map=/mnt/floppy/map
install=/mnt/floppy/boot.b
prompt
compact
timeout=50
image=/mnt/floppy/vmlinuzLAP
   label=Laptop
   root=/dev/sda1
   read-only
image=/mnt/floppy/vmlinuzDESK
   label=Desktop
   root=/dev/sda1
   read-only
image=/mnt/floppy/vmlinuzDESK
   label=rescue
   root=/dev/hdc1
   read-only
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

I have two kernels, one for my 486 laptop which required the math-co
emulation in the kernel and the other for my desktop.  The rescue
allows me to make an emergency boot to the hard drive.
<P>Last but not least, with the floppy still mounted, run LILO to
install it on the floppy with the command:
<P><B> ==> lilo -C /mnt/floppy/lilo.conf</B>
<P>Once LILO has been installed on the floppy, skip the next two steps,
unless you enjoy doing this over again :)
<P>
<H3>Kernel only installation</H3>

<P>Copy the newly made kernel to a floppy disk:
<P><B> ==> cp arch/i386/boot/zImage /dev/fd0</B>
<P>or
<P><B> ==> cat arch/i386/boot/zImage > /dev/fd0</B>
<P>Yes, there are many ways to copy the kernel to a floppy, but the
last way, my favorite, is a little more encrypted.  Try not to
forget the > unless you like viewing binary files :)

<H3>Setting the root and swap on the floppy</H3>

<P>Once the kernel is on the floppy, you need to set the root device to
the ZIP disk:
<B> ==> rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/sda1</B>
I'm not sure if the next option is needed, but I did it none the
less.  To set the swap:
<P><B> ==> rdev -s /dev/fd0 /dev/sda2</B>
