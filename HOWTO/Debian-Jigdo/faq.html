>Move the jigdo download directory up by as many directories as possible, closer to the
      drives's root directory.</P
><P
>The NTFS filesystem has a 255 character limit on a file's pathname.  When jigdo-lite
      downloads files from the internet, it makes a copy of the server directory structure in its
      download directory.  With their very long names, the above Debian packages may exceed the
      allowed path length, which leads to error messages like "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Cannot write to `[very long
      pathname]' (No such file or directory)</TT
>".</P
><P
>Some people may now wonder: Why does jigdo-lite use wget's
      "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--force-directories</TT
>" switch, which creates these problematic directory
      hierarchies?</P
><P
>Early versions of jigdo-lite did not use it, but then some folks requested that
      jigdo-lite always use the "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--continue</TT
>" switch to avoid half-downloaded
      .deb files being ignored and deleted when you interrupt and restart jigdo-lite.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, it turned out that this led to problems: The Debian servers contained
      several identically named files (e.g. "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root.bin</TT
>") in different directories,
      and if you interrupted jigdo-lite at roughly the right time during the download, the chances
      were high that the resumed download would append data to the wrong half-downloaded file,
      corrupting it and making the entire jigdo download fail.</P

        rsync://server.org/path/binary-i386-1.iso binary-i386-1.iso</B

      with the broken download: <B

>mkdir mnt; mount -t iso9660 -o loop *.tmp mnt</B

      Next, start a new download in a different directory, and enter the path of the mnt directory

    download a new, fixed .jigdo file, do I need to download all the data over again?</H2
><P
>You may find that the .jigdo file you downloaded is broken.  It's uncommon, but it does
      happen from time to time with moving targets like Debian testing or unstable.</P
><P
>If you find that <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

      .jigdo file (when a fixed one becomes available), but you <EM

> need to
      download all the ISO data again.</P
><P
>You can use the same loop mounting trick we use when updating an ISO image.  The
      difference is that there's no finished .iso file to start with, but the .iso.tmp file is an
      ISO image too and can be used to finish the download without having to re-download all the
      data that was downloaded before the broken .jigdo file caused jigdo-lite to halt.  Simply loop
      mount the .iso.tmp file on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt</TT
> and when you re-run
      jigdo-lite with the fixed .jigdo file, tell jigdo-lite to scan <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt</TT
>.  Don't forget to rename or move the .iso.tmp file so it
      doesn't interfere with jigdo-lite which will want to create a new .iso.tmp file.</P

      to do differently is to download the .jigdo and .template files for DVDs instead of CDs.  You
      can find the DVD .jigdo and .template files at <A

><P
>Under MS Windows, you need to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>jigdo-win-0.7.1a</TT
> (released 21 July
      2004) or later to create DVD-sized images.  This is because of a bug in the large file support
      of Mingw32, the compiler used to create the MS Windows executables.  The bug got fixed on this
      date, and <TT

    loop-mounted images in one go.  How can I do this?</H2
><P
>When updating CD images, it's tiresome to keep loop-mounting and unmounting images.
      However, by default the Linux kernel only supports eight loop devices, and jigdo-lite's menu
      of previously entered paths only has five entries.</P
><P
>To scan many loop-mounted images, you must first tell the Linux kernel to support more
      than the default eight devices.  This is done by giving the "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>max_loop</TT
>"
      parameter to the module when loading it, e.g. with "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>modprobe loop
      max_loop=16</TT
>" on the command line or by adding the line "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>options loop
      max_loop=16</TT
>" to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modules.conf</TT
>.  In Debian, you must put
      this line into a file named e.g. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>update-modules</B

><P
>Having mounted the individual images, you can pass the parent directory of their mount
      points to jigdo-lite for scanning.  For example, if the images are mounted under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/myloopmounts/image1/</TT
> etc., pass "<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/myloopmounts</TT
