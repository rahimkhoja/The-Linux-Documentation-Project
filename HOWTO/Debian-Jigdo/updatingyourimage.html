>Presumably, you've read the last section, followed the instructions, burned your newly
  created ISO files onto CD and are feeling warm and fuzzy.  Sooner or later, some packages will get
  updated and now you want to donate your old CDs to some newbie at your local LUG's installfest and
  burn yourself a set of updated CDs.  Since you're well on the way to becoming a jigdo-guru, we
  won't go into as much painful detail as we did in the last section.</P
><P
>The first step is to download the .jigdo and .template files, again, for the images you want
  to update.  You may wonder why you need to download them a second time.  The reason is because the
  updated image you want to download has changed.  Files may have been added or deleted, but even if
  not, any updated packages or files will have a different checksum from the checksum listed in the
  .jigdo and .template files you used when you first downloaded the images.</P
><P
>At this point, you're either holding an outdated Debian CD in your hand or you have the CD's
  outdated ISO image on your hard drive.  Let's go through the steps of getting an updated ISO file.
  If you have a CD, put it in your CD drive and mount it:</P

      If you already have a previous version of the CD you are
      downloading, jigdo can re-use files on the old CD that are also
      present on the new image, and you do not need to download them
      again.  You found the secret message; you're a very careful
      reader.  Mount the old CD ROM and enter the path it is mounted
      under (e.g. `/mnt/cdrom'). Alternatively, just press enter if you
      want to start the download of any remaining files.
      
      You can also enter a single digit from the list below to

>What happened?  Actually, I wanted to show you this because you'll bump into it sooner or
  later.  I'm updating an ISO file, but the outdated image file is in the same directory I'm working
  in.  Jigdo-lite wants to generate a file called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>woody-i386-1.iso</TT
> but there's
  already a file by that name in the current directory (the outdated image).  Jigdo-lite doesn't
  want to destroy that file, so it bails and lets me know that I can either delete that file or use
  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--force</TT
> to overwrite the file.   You could also rename or move the file too,
  but I guess <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>jigdo-lite</SPAN
> assumes we already know this.    :-)</P
><P
>Don't be timid about moving or renaming the image file just because it's loop mounted.  The
  filesystem uses inodes under the hood, and even if you move or rename the file, the inode stays
  the same.  You won't hurt the filesystem mounted under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt</TT
>.
  As for deleting the ISO file, that won't hurt the mounted filesystem either.  A file's inode gets
  deallocated only when the inode's reference count drops to zero.  Mounting the ISO image bumps the
  reference count up, so the file really gets deleted only after you <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rm</B
> the file
  <EM
>and</EM
> umount the loop device.  All you people who are updating the CD don't
  have to worry about any of this.  :-)</P
