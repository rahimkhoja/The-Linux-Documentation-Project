<P>This document will guide you through the steps used to install and
configure an environment for modelling and rendering three-dimensional
graphics using Linux.  In this section you will also find information
in  laymans terms about the required components and how they piece
together.  The installation section is purposely minimal; merely the
quick and dirty steps needed to take to get up and running (if it
doesn't work, more information is available).  For those that want more
information about the software components and what they do (in general),
please continue reading.
<P>There are, at the minimum, three software packages you'll need in order to
get up and running.  These are as follows (in the order they are
explained, not the order they are installed):

<UL>
<LI>a graphics library;</LI>
<LI>a graphics modeller;</LI>
<LI>a graphics renderer.</LI>
