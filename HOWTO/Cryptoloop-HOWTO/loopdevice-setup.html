>Cryptoloop can be used either on a file or an entire file system. The following describes how to
set it up on a particular partition. This partition can be any partition you like; the following
example uses <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/sda1</TT
>. I have chosen to use AES as a cipher, but you can substitute any cipher
you like that has been enabled in the kernel. You can get a list of the algorithms supported by
your currently running kernel by looking into <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc/crypto</TT
>. An excellent resource, discussing the
different cryptographic algorithms, are Bruce Schneier's books, Applied Cryptography and Practical
Cryptography. Both AES and Serpent are probably a reasonable choice. AES has been cryptanalyzed a lot
and no serious weaknesses have been discovered so far. Serpent has not been analyzed as much, but is
considered to be even a little bit stronger than AES. However, Serpent is also slower than AES.
Stay away from DES, it is both slow and weak. Triple-DES may be an option, but AES is probably more
secure and faster, so there is really no reason to use Triple-DES anymore.

>The command prompts for a password. Select a strong password and try to remember it without having to stick a Post-It note to your monitor. 
        There is one big downside to using Cryptoloop. Since the password is hashed to create the encryption key, it is not easy to change the password later on. 
        The most straight-forward way of changing the password is to create a new encrypted partition or file and move all data into it. For this reason, make 
        sure you select a strong password from the start.  AES may be a strong algorithm, but if you chose a weak password, that security goes down the drain.

>If <B

         Make sure you have followed the instructions above on how to install a patched version of util-linux. Older and unpatched version use a 
         different way of passing the key size, and do not work with the 2.6 Crypto API.
