>This HOWTO results from experiments on one computer. No doubt you will find some directories or files you need to back up in your first stage backup. I have not dealt with saving and restoring X on the first stage, nor have I touched at all on processors other than Intel.</P
><P
>I would appreciate your feedback as you test and improve these scripts on your own computers. I also encourage vendors of backup software to document how to do a minimal backup of their products. I'd like to see the whole Linux community sleep just a little better at night.</P

>We have no way to determine the label of a swap partition. This means that there is no way to provide the swap partition's label when restoring. We could assume that a system with a single swap partition (as indicated by fdisk) has the label used in the swap partition line in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
>, but that only works on single hard drive systems, and could produce subtle errors in systems with multiple swap partitions.</P
><P
>The work-around is to add the label by hand by re-running <TT

>A partition editor to adjust partition boundaries in the <TT
