<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="Howtos-with-LinuxDoc.html#toc1.1">If you want to start immediately</A>
</H2>

<P>To only learn LinuxDoc, skip to  
<A HREF="Howtos-with-LinuxDoc-5.html#learn_">Learning LinuxDoc</A>.  If you want to start writing immediately, then you may try a
"fill in the blanks" template which will generate LinuxDoc formatted
output.  
<A HREF="http://www.nyx.net/~sgjoen/The_LDP_HOWTO_Generator.html">The LDP HOWTO Generator</A>.  You may use this to just start
writing your Howto and then finish it later by using a text editor on
your PC.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="Howtos-with-LinuxDoc.html#toc1.3">Should you write a HOWTO ?</A>
</H2>

<P> Do you know things about Linux for which no good free
documentation is available and which would be useful to others?  Even
if you don't know the subject well, you can still write about it if
you're eager, willing, and able to learn more about it and have the
time to do it.  Can you write clearly using a word processor or
editor?  Do you want to help thousands of others and let them read
what you write at no cost to them?  Once you've written a document,
are you willing to receive email suggestions from readers and
selectively use this info for improving your HOWTO?  Would you like to
have your writings be available on hundreds of websites throughout the
world?  If you can answer yes to these, then you're encouraged to
write something for the Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  But be
warned that it may take more time than you expected.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4</A> <A HREF="Howtos-with-LinuxDoc.html#toc1.4">Why I wrote this</A>
</H2>

<P>Why did I write this when there is already an "LDP Authoring
Guide"?  Well, the LDP guide is a long and detailed work.  If you want
to get started quickly, you need something much simpler and shorter.</P>
<P>Thanks to Matt Welsh for his example.sgml file which I used as a major
source of info for the example sections.</P>
