><P
>If you are connected to a LAN but still want to use PPP on your personal
Linux machine , you need to address some issues of the routes packets
need to take from your machine to reach your LAN (through your Ethernet
interface) and also to the remote PPP server and beyond.</P
><P
>This section does NOT attempt to teach you about routing - it deals only
with a simple, special case of (static) routing!</P
><P
>I strongly urge you to read the Linux Network Administrator Guide (NAG)
if you are NOT familiar with routing. Also the O'Reilly book "TCP/IP
Network Administration" covers this topic in a very understandable form.</P
><P
>The basic rule of static routing is that the DEFAULT route should be the
one that points to the MOST number of network addresses. For other
networks, enter specific routes to the routing table.</P
><P
>The ONLY situation I am going to cover here is where your Linux box is
on a LAN that is not connected to the Internet - and you want to dial
out to the Internet for personal use whilst still connected to the LAN.</P
><P
>First of all, make sure that your Ethernet route is set up to the
specific network addresses available across your LAN - NOT set to the
default route!</P
><P
>Check this by issuing a route command, you should see something like the
following:-</P

>If your Ethernet interface (eth0) is pointing at the default route, (the
first column will show "default" in the eth0 line) you need to change
your Ethernet initialization scripts to make it point at the specific
network numbers rather than the default route (consult the Net2 HOWTO
and NAG).</P

>As you can see, we have a host route to the PPP server ( 10.144.153.51)
via ppp0 and also a default network route that uses the PPP server as
its gateway.</P
><P
>If your set up needs to be more complex than this - read the routing
documents already mentioned and consult an expert at your site!</P
><P
>If your LAN already has routers on it, you will already have gateways
established to the wider networks available at your site. You should
STILL point your default route at the PPP interface - and make the other
routes specific to the networks they serve.</P

>When you set up a Linux box on an existing LAN to link into the
Internet, you are potentially opening your entire LAN to the Internet -
and the hackers that reside there. Before you do this, I strongly urge
you to consult your network administrator and site security policy. If
your PPP connection to the Internet is used to successfully attack your
site, you will at the very least earn the intense anger of your fellow
users, network and system administrators. You may also find yourself in
very much more serious trouble!</P
><P
>Before you connect a LAN to the Internet, you should consider the
security implications of even a DYNAMIC connection - hence the earlier
reference to the O'Reilly "Building Internet Firewalls"!</P
