><P
>Every device that connects to the Internet must have its own, unique IP
number. These are assigned centrally by a designated authority for each
country.</P
><P
>If you are connecting a local area network (LAN) to the Internet,
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>YOU MUST</I
> use an IP number from your own assigned network range for
all the computers and devices you have on your LAN. You <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>MUST NOT</I
>
pick IP numbers out of the air and use these whilst connecting to
another LAN (let alone the Internet). At worst this will simply not work
at all and could cause total havoc as your 'stolen' IP number starts
interfering with the communications of another computer that is already
using the IP number you have picked out of the air.</P
><P
>Please note that the IP numbers used throughout this document (with some
exceptions) are from the 'unconnected network numbers' series that are
reserved for use by networks that are not (ever) connected to the
Internet.</P
><P
>There are IP numbers that are specifically dedicated to LANs that do not
connect to the Internet. The IP number sequences are:-</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>One A Class Network Address

10.0.0.0 (netmask 255.0.0.0)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>16 B Class Network Addresses

172.16.0.0 - 172.31.0.0 (netmask 255.255.0.0)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>256 C Class Network Addresses

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.0 (netmask 255.255.255.0)</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>If you have a LAN for which you have <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> been allocated IP
numbers by the responsible authority in your country, you should use one
of the network numbers from the above sequences for your machines.</P
><P
>These numbers should <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>never</I
> be used on the Internet.</P
><P
>However, they can be used for the local Ethernet on a machine that is
connecting to the Internet. This is because IP numbers are actually
allocated to a network interface, not to a computer. So whilst your
Ethernet interface may use 10.0.0.1 (for example), when you hook onto
the Internet using PPP, your PPP interface will be given another (and
valid) IP number by the server. Your PC will have Internet connectivity,
but the other computers on your LAN will not.</P
><P
>However, using Linux and the IP Masquerade (also known as NAT - Network
address Translation) capabilities of the Linux and the ipfwadm
software, you can connect your LAN to the Internet (with some
restriction of services), even if you do not have valid IP numbers for the
machines on your Ethernet.</P
><P
>For more information on how to do this see the IP Masquerade mini-HOWTO
at <A

>Linux IP Masquerade mini HOWTO</A
></P
><P
>For most users, who are connecting a single machine to an Internet 
service provider via PPP, obtaining an IP number (or more accurately, a
network number) will not be necessary.</P
><P
>If you wish to connect a small LAN to the Internet, many Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) can provide you with a dedicated subnet (a specific
sequence of IP numbers) from their existing IP address space.
Alternatively, use IP Masquerading.</P
><P
>For users, who are connecting a single PC to the Internet via an ISP,
most providers use <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>dynamic</I
> IP number assignment. That is, as part
of the connection process, the PPP service you contact will tell your
machine what IP number to use for the PPP interface during the current
session. This number will not be the same every time you connect to your
ISP. </P
><P
>With dynamic IP numbers, you are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> necessarily
given the same IP number each time you connect. This has implications for
server type applications on your Linux machine such as sendmail, ftpd, httpd
and so forth. These services are based on the premise that the computer
offering the service is accessible at the same IP number all the time
(or at least the same fully qualified domain name - FQDN - and that DNS
resolution of the name to IP address is available).</P
><P
>The limitations of service due to dynamic IP number assignment (and ways
to work around these, where possible) are discussed later in the
document.</P
