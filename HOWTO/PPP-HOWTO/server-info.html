>Before you can establish a PPP connection with a server, you need to
obtain the following information (from the sysadmin/user support people
of the PPP server):-

<P

><LI
><P
>The telephone number(s) to dial for the service

If you are behind a PABX. You also need the PABX number that gives you
an outside dial tone - this is frequently digit zero (0) or nine (9).&#13;</P

> Does the server use DYNAMIC or STATIC IP numbers?

If the server uses STATIC IP numbers, then you may need to know what IP
number to use for your end of the PPP connection. If your ISP is
providing you with a subnet of valid IP numbers, you will need to know
the IP numbers you can use and the network mask (netmask).


Most Internet Service Providers use DYNAMIC IP numbers. As mentioned
above, this has some implications in terms of the services you can
use.


However, even if you are using STATIC IP numbers, most PPP servers will
never (for security reasons) allow the client to specify an IP number as
this is a security risk. You <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>do</I
> still need to know this information!&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>What are the IP numbers of the ISPs Domain Name Servers?

There should be at least two, although only one is needed.


There could be a problem here. The MS Windows 95 PPP setup allows the
DNS address to be passed to the client as part of its connection
process. So your ISP (or corporate help desk) may well tell you you
don't need the IP address of the DNS server(s).


For Linux, you <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>DO</I
> need the address of at least one DNS. The linux
implementation of PPP does not allow the setting of the DNS IP number
dynamically at connection time - and quite possibly will never do
so.


<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Note</I
>: whilst Linux (as a PPP client) cannot accept the DNS address
from a server, it can, when acting as a server, pass this information to
clients using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>dns-addr</TT
> pppd option.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Does the server require the use of PAP/CHAP?

If this is the case you need to know the "id" and "secret" you are to
use in connecting. (These are probably your user name and
password at your ISP).&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Does the server automatically start PPP, or do you need to issue any
commands to start PPP on the server once you are logged in?

If you must issue a command to start PPP, what is it?&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Is the server a Microsoft Windows NT system and, if so, is it
using the MS PAP/CHAP system?

Many corporate LANs seem to use MS Windows NT this way for increased security.</P
