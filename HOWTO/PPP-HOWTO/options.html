Whilst you can use this file as the basis of your

options file that does not include all the comments in the template - it
will be much shorter and easier to read/maintain.</P

servers), create a general <TT

options that are common for all the serial ports on which you are
supporting dial in/out  and set up individual option files for each serial
line on which you will be establishing a PPP connection with the
individual settings required for each port.</P

>These port specific option files are named <TT

<TT

your serial ports).</P

>However, for a single PPP connection, you can happily use the
<TT

options as arguments in the pppd command itself.</P
><P
>It is easier to maintain a setup that uses
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/ppp/options.ttySx</TT

number of different sites, you can create option files for each site in
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/ppp/options.site</TT
> and then specify the option file as a
parameter to the PPP command as you connect (using the <TT

# Use the executable or shell command specified to set up the serial
# line.  This script would typically use the "chat" program to dial the
# modem and start the remote ppp session.
#connect "echo You need to install a connect command."

# Run the executable or shell command specified after pppd has
# terminated the link.  This script could, for example, issue commands
# to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control signals
# were not available.
#disconnect "chat -- \d+++\d\c OK ath0 OK"

# async character map -- 32-bit hex; each bit is a character
# that needs to be escaped for pppd to receive it.  0x00000001
# represents '\x01', and 0x80000000 represents '\x1f'.
#asyncmap 0

# Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network
# packets to be sent or received.
#auth

# Use hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) to control the flow of data
# on the serial port.
#crtscts

# Use software flow control (i.e. XON/XOFF) to control the flow of data
# on the serial port.
#xonxoff

# Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as
# the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed.  This
# entry is removed when the PPP connection is broken.
#defaultroute

# Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on transmission
# (regardless of whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its
# async control character map).  The characters to be escaped are
# specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas.  Note that
# almost any character can be specified for the escape option, unlike
# the asyncmap option which only allows control characters to be
# specified.  The characters which may not be escaped are those with hex
# values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.
#escape 11,13,ff

# Don't use the modem control lines.
#local

# Specifies that pppd should use a UUCP-style lock on the serial device
# to ensure exclusive access to the device.
#lock

# Use the modem control lines.  On Ultrix, this option implies hardware
# flow control, as for the crtscts option.  (This option is not fully
# implemented.)
#modem

# Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to &#60;n&#62; for negotiation.  pppd
# will ask the peer to send packets of no more than &#60;n&#62; bytes. The
# minimum MRU value is 128.  The default MRU value is 1500.  A value of
# 296 is recommended for slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256
# bytes of data).
#mru 542

# Set the interface netmask to &#60;n&#62;, a 32 bit netmask in "decimal dot"
# notation (e.g. 255.255.255.0).
#netmask 255.255.255.0

# Disables the default behaviour when no local IP address is specified,
# which is to determine (if possible) the local IP address from the
# hostname. With this option, the peer will have to supply the local IP
# address during IPCP negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on the
# command line or in an options file).
#noipdefault

# Enables the "passive" option in the LCP.  With this option, pppd will
# attempt to initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the
# peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from
# the peer (instead of exiting, as it does without this option).
#passive

# With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP packets to initiate a
# connection until a valid LCP packet is received from the peer (as for
# the "passive" option with old versions of pppd).
#silent

# Don't request or allow negotiation of any options for LCP and IPCP
# (use default values).
#-all

# Disable Address/Control compression negotiation (use default, i.e.
# address/control field disabled).
#-ac

# Disable asyncmap negotiation (use the default asyncmap, i.e. escape
# all control characters).
#-am

# Don't fork to become a background process (otherwise pppd will do so
# if a serial device is specified).
#-detach

# Disable IP address negotiation (with this option, the remote IP
# address must be specified with an option on the command line or in an
# options file).
#-ip

# Disable magic number negotiation.  With this option, pppd cannot
# detect a looped-back line.
#-mn

# Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation (use default, i.e.
# 1500).
#-mru

# Disable protocol field compression negotiation (use default, i.e.
# protocol field compression disabled).
#-pc

# Require the peer to authenticate itself using PAP.
# This requires TWO WAY authentication - do NOT use this for a standard
# PAP authenticated link to an ISP as this will require the ISP machine
# to authenticate itself to your machine (and it will not be able to).
#+pap

# Don't agree to authenticate using PAP.
#-pap

# Require the peer to authenticate itself using CHAP [Cryptographic
# Handshake Authentication Protocol] authentication.
# This requires TWO WAY authentication - do NOT use this for a standard
# CHAP authenticated link to an ISP as this will require the ISP machine
# to authenticate itself to your machine (and it will not be able to).
#+chap

# Don't agree to authenticate using CHAP.
#-chap

# Disable negotiation of Van Jacobson style IP header compression (use
# default, i.e. no compression).
#-vj

# Increase debugging level (same as -d).  If this option is given, pppd
# will log the contents of all control packets sent or received in a
# readable form.  The packets are logged through syslog with facility
# daemon and level debug. This information can be directed to a file by
# setting up /etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see syslog.conf(5)).  (If
# pppd is compiled with extra debugging enabled, it will log messages
# using facility local2 instead of daemon).
#debug

# Append the domain name &#60;d&#62; to the local host name for authentication
# purposes.  For example, if gethostname() returns the name porsche,
# but the fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you would
# use the domain option to set the domain name to Quotron.COM.
#domain &#60;d&#62;

# Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver.  The argument n
# is a number which is the sum of the following values: 1 to enable
# general debug messages, 2 to request that the contents of received
# packets be printed, and 4 to request that the contents of transmitted
# packets be printed.
#kdebug n

# Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to &#60;n&#62;. Unless the peer
# requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will request that
# the kernel networking code send data packets of no more than n bytes
# through the PPP network interface.
#mtu &#60;n&#62;

# Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to &#60;n&#62;.
# This will probably have to be set to your ISP user name if you are
# using PAP/CHAP.
#name &#60;n&#62;

# Set the user name to use for authenticating this machine with the peer
# using PAP to &#60;u&#62;.
# Do NOT use this if you are using 'name' above!
#user &#60;u&#62;

# Enforce the use of the host name as the name of the local system for
# authentication purposes (overrides the name option).
#usehostname

# Set the assumed name of the remote system for authentication purposes
# to &#60;n&#62;.
#remotename &#60;n&#62;

# Add an entry to this system's ARP [Address Resolution Protocol]
# table with the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet address of this
# system.
#proxyarp

# Use the system password database for authenticating the peer using
# PAP.
#login

# If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to
# the peer every n seconds. Under Linux, the echo-request is sent when
# no packets have been received from the peer for n seconds. Normally
# the peer should respond to the echo-request by sending an echo-reply.
# This option can be used with the lcp-echo-failure option to detect
# that the peer is no longer connected.
#lcp-echo-interval &#60;n&#62;

# If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead if n
# LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply.
# If this happens, pppd will terminate the connection.  Use of this
# option requires a non-zero value for the lcp-echo-interval parameter.
# This option can be used to enable pppd to terminate after the physical
# connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has hung up) in
# situations where no hardware modem control lines are available.
#lcp-echo-failure &#60;n&#62;

# Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to &#60;n&#62; seconds
# (default 3).
#lcp-restart &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request transmissions to &#60;n&#62;
# (default 3).
#lcp-max-terminate &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request transmissions to &#60;n&#62;
# (default 10).
# Some PPP servers are slow to start up. You may need to increase this
# if you keep getting 'serial line looped back' errors and your are SURE
# that you have logged in correctly and PPP should be starting on the server.
#lcp-max-configure &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before starting
# to send configure-Rejects instead to &#60;n&#62; (default 10).
#lcp-max-failure &#60;n&#62;

# Set the IPCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to &#60;n&#62;

#ipcp-restart &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request transmissions to &#60;n&#62;
# (default 3).
#ipcp-max-terminate &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-request transmissions to &#60;n&#62;

#ipcp-max-configure &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs returned before starting
# to send configure-Rejects instead to &#60;n&#62; (default 10).
#ipcp-max-failure &#60;n&#62;

# Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to &#60;n&#62; seconds
# (default 3).
#pap-restart &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of PAP authenticate-request transmissions to
# &#60;n&#62; (default 10).
#pap-max-authreq &#60;n&#62;

# Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for

#chap-restart &#60;n&#62;

# Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to &#60;n&#62;

# If this option is given, pppd will re-challenge the peer every &#60;n&#62;

# With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of our local IP
# address, even if the local IP address was specified in an option.
