<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Configuring sendmail</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 The main configuration file</A>
</H2>

<P>Sendmail uses a highly complex rule system for it's
configuration.  While you can do lots of neat tricks with
this stuff, writing a <CODE>sendmail.cf</CODE> file from scratch
is rather unusual and time-consuming.  If you are
interested in doing so, you should stop reading this
document right now and instead read the "Bat Book" from
O'Reilly.
<P>
<P>Instead of hand-crafting these rules, we will rely on
the <CODE>m4</CODE> macro processor to put together our
configuration file from ready-made pieces which are
distributed together with sendmail.
<P>
<P>Let's look at the first lines of the <CODE>sendmail.mc</CODE> file:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
include(/usr/lib/sendmail.cf/m4/cf.m4)
VERSIONID(`sendmail.mc - roessler@guug.de')
OSTYPE(debian)
define(`ALIAS_FILE',`/etc/mail/aliases')
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>In the beginning, <CODE>cf.m4</CODE> is included.  This m4 macro
file contains lots of macro definitions for the rest of the
file.  Be sure that the path you give here is correct -
the one we are representing in our example is typical for
Debian GNU/Linux.  The <CODE>OSTYPE</CODE> macro is used to give
some useful defaults for certain configuration values.  If
you aren't using a Debian system, you should replace the
word "debian" by "linux" here.  <CODE>ALIAS_FILE</CODE> tells
sendmail where to look for the list of aliases.
<P>
<P>The following lines tell sendmail to use the
<CODE>genericstable</CODE> feature, and where to find the
configuration files needed to use it: 
<HR>
<PRE>
FEATURE(masquerade_envelope) FEATURE(genericstable, `hash
-o /etc/mail/genericstable')
GENERICS_DOMAIN_FILE(`/etc/mail/genericsdomain') 
</PRE>
<HR>

The <CODE>masquerade_envelope</CODE> feature tells sendmail to
apply header rewriting to the <EM>envelope</EM> sender of a
message.  This is the mail address to which external mail
delivery subsystems will direct their delivery failure
reports and warning messages.  The <CODE>generics*</CODE> files
will be explained below.
<P>
<P>Now, we have to define a so-called smart host, that is, a
machine which will handle outgoing mail for your system.
Note that this machine may be different from your ISP's
POP and IMAP servers.  If in doubt, contact the hotline.
The code in the master configuration file:
<HR>
<PRE>
define(`SMART_HOST',`mail-out.your.provider')
</PRE>
<HR>

Please replace <EM>mail-out.your.provider</EM> by the fully
qualified hostname of your internet service provider.
<P>
<P>The final two lines include the "mailer" definitions
which are needed by sendmail to find out how to handle
various types of mail:
<HR>
<PRE>
MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>To generate the <CODE>sendmail.cf</CODE> file from this
<CODE>sendmail.mc</CODE>, type the following commands (as root):
<HR>
<PRE>
# m4 sendmail.mc > _sendmail.cf
# mv -f _sendmail.cf sendmail.cf
</PRE>
<HR>

Note the technique of writing <CODE>m4</CODE>'s output to a
temporary file which is thereafter moved to the proper
place.  This helps us to prevent sendmail from reading
partially written configuration files.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Address rewriting</A>
</H2>

<P>First, we have to tell sendmail what addresses are to
be considered local (and thus should be subjected to the
rewriting).  This is quite simple: Just put the fully
qualified host name of your machine into the file
<CODE>&sol;etc&sol;mail&sol;genericsdomain</CODE>.  To get your
host's fully qualified name, type the following command:
<HR>
<PRE>
 $ hostname -f 
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Now, let's come to the rewriting table proper:
<CODE>&sol;etc&sol;mail&sol;genericstable</CODE>.  This file
consists of two white-space separated columns.  The first
column contains the local address, the second column
contains the e-mail address which should be used instead.
The file may look like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
harry   harryx@your.isp
maude   maudey@her.isp
root    fredx@your.isp
news    fredx@your.isp
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Note that there should be one entry for <EM>each</EM> account
on the local machine, so that automatically generated mail
which leaks out of the local system carries correct header
information.
<P>
<P>For performance reasons, sendmail won't use this text
file directly, but rely on a "hashed" version instead.  To
generate it, type the following command:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
# makemap -r hash genericstable.db &lt; genericstable
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Note that the rewriting rules from the
<CODE>genericstable</CODE> will <EM>not</EM> apply to local mail or to
messages you receive from outside - the mapping is only
used if a message leaves your local system for your ISP's
smart host.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Aliases</A>
</H2>

<P>The aliases file contains additional local names which
are only valid for local messages.  This is useful for
administrative accounts like <CODE>root</CODE> which receive
automatically generated messages from your system.
<P>
<P>A reasonable start for
<CODE>&sol;etc&sol;mail&sol;aliases</CODE> could look like the
following file:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
root: fred
news: root
postmaster: root
mail: root
www: root

nobody: &sol;dev&sol;null
MAILER-DAEMON: nobody
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>This example will forward local mail for the <CODE>root</CODE>,
<CODE>news</CODE>, <CODE>postmaster</CODE>, <CODE>mail</CODE>, and <CODE>www</CODE> users
to <CODE>fred</CODE>, while messages for <CODE>nobody</CODE> and
<CODE>MAILER-DAEMON</CODE> will be redirected to
<CODE>&sol;dev&sol;null</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Just like the <CODE>genericstable</CODE>, <CODE>aliases</CODE> may
contain <EM>lots</EM> of entries.  Thus, it would once again
be inefficient for sendmail to use the text file we just
described.  The same mechanism as with <CODE>genericstable</CODE>
is used for <CODE>aliases</CODE>: A hashed database is generated.
Instead of using <CODE>makemap</CODE> directly, you can type in
the command <CODE>newaliases</CODE> this time.  It will
automatically take care of all what's needed.
