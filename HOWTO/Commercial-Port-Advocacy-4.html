<P>First, you need to identify an area where Linux is deficient
in programs.  I wouldn't try to convince any company to port
their web server to Linux.  There are plenty of such programs
available.  I'd much rather use my time trying to convince
companies to port games or kindergarten through 12th grade
educational programs to Linux, as there's very little of those
types available (none in the educational area, so far as I
know).
<P>Second, you need to identify companies that are most likely to
be interested.  I have no hard evidence of this, but I strongly
suspect that your efforts will meet more success if you
concentrate on second-tier companies rather than on market
leaders in your chosen category.  Companies with seemingly dated
products or products that were aimed at obscure platforms would
seem to be good targets.  Their software may not be dated for
Linux users since we're not always taken in by the hype factor. 
They may well be looking for new markets for their products as
their present market dwindles along with their ability to
compete.  I doubt that Disney or Davidson and Co. would consider
porting their educational programs nearly as quickly as say,
Soleil Software or Topologika.  Also, if a company provides its
software for both Windows and Macintosh currently, it may be more
likely to consider supporting yet another OS than one that is
exclusive to the Windows or Mac world.  If all the companies in
your target category are Windows or Macintosh exclusive I'd try
the Mac shops first, as a Linux port would give them a much
greater market expansion (on a percentage basis) than it would a
Windows-only company.
