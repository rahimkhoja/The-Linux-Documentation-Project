>As mentioned earlier, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PROMPT_COMMAND are all stored
in the Bash environment.  For those of us coming from a DOS background, the
idea of tossing big hunks of code into the environment is horrifying, 
because that DOS environment was small, and didn't exactly grow well.
There are probably practical limits to what you can and should put in the
environment, but I don't know what they are, and we're probably talking a
couple of orders of magnitude larger than what DOS users are used to.  As
Dan put it:&#13;</P

>"In my interactive shell I have 62 aliases and 25 functions.  My rule
of thumb is that if I need something solely for interactive use and
can handily write it in bash I make it a shell function (assuming
it can't be easily expressed as an alias).  If these people are
worried about memory they don't need to be using bash.  Bash is one
of the largest programs I run on my linux box (outside of Oracle).
Run top sometime and press 'M' to sort by memory - see how close
bash is to the top of the list.  Heck, it's bigger than sendmail!
Tell 'em to go get ash or something."&#13;</P

>I guess he was using console only the day he tried that: running X and X
apps, I have a lot of stuff larger than Bash.  But the idea is the same:
the environment is something to be used, and don't worry about overfilling
it.&#13;</P
><P
>I risk censure by Unix gurus when I say this (for the crime of
over-simplification), but functions are basically small shell scripts that
are loaded into the environment for the purpose of efficiency.  Quoting Dan
again: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Shell functions are about as efficient as they can be.  It is the
approximate equivalent of sourcing a bash/bourne shell script save that no
file I/O need be done as the function is already in memory.  The shell
functions are typically loaded from [.bashrc or .bash_profile] depending on
whether you want them only in the initial shell or in subshells as well.
Contrast this with running a shell script: Your shell forks, the child does
an exec, potentially the path is searched, the kernel opens the file and
examines enough bytes to determine how to run the file, in the case of a
shell script a shell must be started with the name of the script as its
argument, the shell then opens the file, reads it and executes the
statements.  Compared to a shell function, everything other than executing
the statements can be considered unnecessary overhead."</SPAN

>Any arguments you pass to the alias are passed to the command line of the
aliased command (ls in the first two cases).  Note that aliases can be
nested, and they can be used to make a normal unix command behave in a
different way.  (I agree with the argument that you shouldn't use the
latter kind of aliases - if you get in the habit of relying on "rm *" to
ask you if you're sure, you may lose important files on a system that
doesn't use your alias.)&#13;</P
><P
>Functions are used for more complex program structures.  As a general rule,
use an alias for anything that can be done in one line.  Functions differ
from shell scripts in that they are loaded into the environment so that
they work more quickly.  As a general rule again, you would want to
keep functions relatively small, and any shell script that gets relatively
large should remain a shell script rather than turning it into a function.
Your decision to load something as a function is also going to depend on
how often you use it.  If you use a small shell script infrequently, leave
it as a shell script.  If you use it often, turn it into a function.&#13;</P

something like the following:&#13;</P

><P
>This could readily be set as an alias, but for the sake of example, we'll
make it a function.  If you type the text shown into a text file and then
source that file, the function will be in your environment, and be
immediately available at the command line without the overhead of a shell
script mentioned previously.  The usefulness of this becomes more obvious
if you consider adding more functionality to the above function, such as
using an if statement to execute some special code when links are found in
the listing.&#13;</P
