difficult to parse.  Again, if you have the <TT

wrote the following code to output just the time the system has been up:&#13;</P

>Output looks like "1h31m" if the system has been up less than a day, or
"14d17h3m" if it has been up more than a day.  You can massage the output
to look the way you want it to.  This evolved after an e-mail discussion
with David Osolkowski, who gave me some ideas.&#13;</P

>Before I wrote that script, I had a couple emails with David O, who said
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"me and a couple guys got on irc and started hacking with sed and
got this: 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uptime | sed -e 's/.* \(.* days,\)\? \(.*:..,\) .*/\1 \2/' -e's/,//g' -e 's/ days/d/' -e 's/ up //'</B
>.  
It's ugly, and doesn't use regex nearly as well as it should, but it
works.  It's pretty slow on a P75, though, so I removed it."</SPAN
>
Considering how much <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uptime</B
> output varies depending on
how long a system has been up, I was impressed they managed as well as they
did.  You can use this on systems without 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/</TT
> filesystem, but as he says, it
may be slow.&#13;</P
><P
>Relative speed: the "upt" script takes about 0.68 seconds on an unloaded
486SX25 (half that as a function).  Contrary to David's guess, his use of
sed to parse the output of "uptime" takes only 0.22 seconds.&#13;</P
