>Non-screen users should skip this section.  Of course, screen is an awesome
program and what you should really do is rush out and find out what screen
is - if you've read this far in the HOWTO, you're enough of a Command Line
Interface Junkie that you need to know.&#13;</P
><P
>If you use screen in Xterms and you want to manipulate the title bar, your
life may just have become a bit more complicated ...  Screen can, but doesn't
automatically, treat the Xterm title bar as a hardstatus line (whatever
that means, but it's where we put our Xterm title).  If you're a RedHat
user, you'll probably find the following line in your

>If that line isn't in there, you should put it in.  This allows the
titlebar manipulations in the previous section to work under Xterm.  But I
found they failed when I used rxvt.  I e-mailed a question about this to
the screen maintainers, and Michael Schroeder (one of those good people
labouring behind the scenes to make free Unix/Linux software as great as it
is) told me to add the following to my <TT

>I don't know if this will work for other Xterm variants, but since the two
lines are functionally identical except for the name of the Xterm type,
perhaps ...  I leave this as an exercise for the reader.  It did fix my
problem, although I haven't researched further to see if it interferes with
the icon-titlebar naming distinction.&#13;</P
