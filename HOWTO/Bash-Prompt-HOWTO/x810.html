>11.14. Prompt Beeps After Long-Running Commands</H1
><P
>Robb Matzke (matzke at llnl dot gov) sent me this a long time ago (sorry
Robb, should have put it in sooner!).  This prompt uses Perl and the
builtin <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>times</B
> command to determine if the program that
just finished running has used more than a certain amount of time.  The
assumption is that you might have changed desktops by then and notification
would be nice, so it rings a bell.  I've tried to avoid using Perl because
the overhead is fairly high, but this is a good use for it.&#13;</P

>I haven't tested this prompt myself.  I like the idea though.  Robb
includes instructions in the comments.&#13;</P

#    02111-1307, USA.
#
# Purpose:
#
#    This program is intended to be called each time a shell prompt is
#    displayed. It looks at current CPU times (user+system) for the shell and
#    its children, and if the CPU time is more than some user-specified amount
#    then user-specified commands are executed.  The author uses it to provide
#    an audio indication of when a long-running command completes.
#
# Usage:
#
#    The prompt_bell command takes two arguments: the name of a file
#    containing the latest CPU usage information for the shell and its
#    children, and some optional state information from the environment
#    variable $PROMPT_BELL_STATE.
#
#    The times file simply contains one or more times, zero or more to a line,
#    each of the form `#h#m#.#s' where `#' is a sequence of one or more
#    decimal digits and `#h' is the optional number of hours, `#m' is the
#    required number of minutes, and `#.#s' is the number of seconds and
#    fractions thereof. The total time is the sum of all the times in this
#    file. Example:
#
#        0m0.050s 0m0.060s
#        0m15.790s 0m0.220s
#
#    The output from this command is one or more semicolon-separated shell
#    commands which should be eval'd by the caller. If the difference between
#    the current CPU times and the previous CPU times (stored in environment
#    variable PROMPT_BELL_STATE) is more than $PROMPT_BELL_TIME seconds
#    (default 10) then the commands printed include the value of environment
#    variable PROMPT_BELL_CMD (default is "echo -ne '\a'").
#
#    Typical usage is:
#        eval "`prompt_bell $TIMES_FILE $PROMPT_BELL_STATE`"
#
#    and this command is usually part of the bash PROMPT_COMMAND. The author's
#    .bashrc contains the following:
#
#        PROMPT_BELL_TIME=15
#        PROMPT_BELL_CMD="echo -e 'done.\a'"
#
#        COMMAND_PROMPT='TIMES_FILE=/tmp/times.$$;
#                        times &#62;$TIMES_FILE;
#                        eval "`prompt_bell $TIMES_FILE $PROMPT_BELL_STATE`";
#                        /bin/rm -f $TIMES_FILE'
#        export PROMPT_BELL_TIME PROMPT_BELL_CMD COMMAND_PROMPT
#
#    Note: the output of `times' is stored in a temporary file to prevent it
#    from being executed in a subshell whose CPU times are always nearly zero.
