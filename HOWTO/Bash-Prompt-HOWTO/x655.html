>You can change the prompt in your current terminal (using the example
"elite" function above) by typing <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>source elite</B
></TT
>
followed by <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>elite</B
></TT
> (assuming that the elite
function file is the working directory).  This is somewhat cumbersome, and
leaves you with an extra function (elite) in your environment space - if
you want to clean up the environment, you would have to type
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>unset elite</B
></TT
> as well.  This would seem like an
ideal candidate for a small shell script, but a script doesn't work here
because the script cannot change the environment of your current shell: it
can only change the environment of the subshell it runs in.  As soon as the
script stops, the subshell goes away, and the changes the script made to
the environment are gone.  What <EM
>can</EM
> change environment
variables of your current shell are environment functions.  The bashprompt
package puts a function called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>callbashprompt</B
> into your
environment, and, while they don't document it, it can be called to load
any bashprompt theme on the fly.  It looks in the theme directory it
installed (the theme you're calling has to be there), sources the function
you asked for, loads the function, and then unsets the function, thus
keeping your environment uncluttered.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>callbashprompt</B
>
wasn't intended to be used this way, and has no error checking, but if you
keep that in mind, it works quite well.&#13;</P
