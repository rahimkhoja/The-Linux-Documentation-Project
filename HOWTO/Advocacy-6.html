<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>As a representative of the Linux community, participate
in mailing list and newsgroup discussions in a professional
manner. Refrain from name-calling and use of vulgar language.
Consider yourself a member of a virtual corporation
with Mr. Torvalds as your Chief Executive Officer.  Your words
will either enhance or degrade the image the reader has of the
Linux community.
</LI>
<LI>Avoid hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims at all costs. It's
unprofessional and will result in unproductive discussions.
</LI>
<LI>A thoughtful, well-reasoned response to a posting will not
only provide insight for your readers, but will also increase
their respect for your knowledge and abilities.
     </LI>
<LI>Don't bite if offered flame-bait.  Too many threads degenerate
into a ``My O/S is better than your O/S'' argument.
Let's accurately describe the capabilities of Linux and
leave it at that.
</LI>
<LI>Always remember that if you insult or are disrespectful
to someone, their negative experience may be shared with many others.
If you do offend someone, please try to make amends.
</LI>
<LI>Focus on what Linux has to offer.  There is no need to bash
the competition.  Linux is a good, solid product
that stands on its own.
</LI>
<LI>Respect the use of other operating systems.  While Linux is
a wonderful platform, it does not meet everyone's needs.
</LI>
<LI>Refer to another product by its proper name.
There's nothing to be gained by attempting to ridicule a company
or its products by using ``creative spelling''.
If we expect respect for Linux,  we must respect other products.
</LI>
<LI>Give credit where credit is due.  Linux is just the kernel.
Without the efforts of people involved with the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU project</A>,
MIT, Berkeley and others too numerous to mention, the Linux
kernel would not be very useful to most people.
</LI>
<LI>Don't insist that Linux is the only answer for a particular
application. Just as the Linux community cherishes the freedom
that Linux provides them, Linux only solutions would deprive 
others of their freedom.
</LI>
<LI>There will be cases where Linux is not the
answer.  Be the first to recognize this and offer another
solution.</LI>
