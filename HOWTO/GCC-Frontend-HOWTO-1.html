<P>This document shows the steps required for creating a new GCC
front end. It helps you to create a compiler of your own with
the help of the GNU Compiler Collection. Basic 
information about tools like Bison and Flex is also provided
to make the document self contained.
<P>I  assume that you have sound knowledge of the
C programming language. A general idea about compilers will
help you understand the document better. If you wish to make
experiments of your own, please download the source code
of GCC from  http://gcc.gnu.org.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 New Versions of the document </A>
</H2>

<P>This version of the document will help you
in developing  basic language constructs. Succeeding revisions
will be focussed on more complex issues.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Feedback and Corrections </A>
</H2>

<P>This document may have mistakes in it because I am writing
from my practical experiments with the front end. There
may be faults in the way I have grasped things. Please inform
me about the mistakes, so that I can correct them in the next version.
I always welcome  suggestions and criticisms. I can be contacted at

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Why I have written this </A>
</H2>

<P>I started out trying to add a small language to the GNU Compiler
Collection. Even though there is an excellent manual which
describes GCC internals, I found it a bit intimidating to
the newbie hacker. I thought of documenting my 
experiments so that even novice programmers can start
tinkering with the complex GCC code base.

<P>This document is the by-product of an intensive
`code reading' experiment conducted at the
Government Engineering College, Trichur (GECT). Students
were asked to read and tinker with the source
code of reasonably complex systems software to
give them a feel of how large systems are designed
and maintained - some of us concentrated on the
GCC front end, others on the back end (we hope to
have a document on hacking the GCC backend soon!).
Those who have a flair for Operating Systems  had a
chance to work on the Linux file system, scheduler,
VM subsystem and the networking stack.
<P>I am indebted to the Free Software community as
a whole for giving me a chance to play with the source  
of useful(and exciting!) programs. My thanks
to the faculty  of the Department of Computer 
Science at GECT for their commitment to education.
Thanks to Mr.Pramode C.E for leading me to Linux
and compilers. 
<P>I am grateful to Tim Josling, who has created a small beautiful
front end, which helped me in all my experiments.
