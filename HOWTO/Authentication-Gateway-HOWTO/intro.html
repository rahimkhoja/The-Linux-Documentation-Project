>&#13;  With wireless networks and public acces areas it is very easy for an
  unauthorized user to gain access. Unauthorized users can look for a
  signal and grab connection information from the signal.
  Unauthorized users can plug their machine into a public terminal and
  gain access to the network. Security has been put in place such as
  WEP, but this security can be subverted with tools like AirSnort.
  One approach to solving these problems is to not rely on the
  wireless security features , and instead to place an authentication
  gateway in front of the wireless network or public access area and
  force users to authenticate against it before using the
  network. This HOWTO describes how to set up this gateway with Linux.
