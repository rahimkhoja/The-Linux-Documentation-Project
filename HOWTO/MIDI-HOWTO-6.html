<P>
<P>MIDI is a set of hardware and software protocols used by electronic musical instruments to communicate.   It was first released in 1982 and has become the de-facto communication standard between electronic musical instruments.  The protocol specifies the physical hardware parameters for the cable and interfaces, and provides a well defined set of communication protocols to exchange musical and timing data.
<P>Prior to MIDI there were several analog, and later basic digital, connection protocols.  The earliest, circa. 1974, would transmit note information as a voltage though a wire from one keyboard to another.  Later, 1980 - 1981,  Roland created a basic digital protocol, DCB.  The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA), working with the equipment manufacturers, defined a standard protocol and physical connection which allowed equipment from all complying manufacturers to connect and communicate with each other.
<P>>From 1985 MIDI interfaces started to appear on home computers and soon after sequencing programs appeared.
