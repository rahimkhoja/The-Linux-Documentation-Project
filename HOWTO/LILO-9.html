<P>2003-11-19</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="LILO.html#toc9.1">Description of the products used in this experiment</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Notice: Folks, that part is <B>NOT</B> a commercial for HP 
production of any means! In fact, a series of HP computers I have been using
has delivered failures in power supply units, problems with hard disks etc.
On the other side, laptop's batteries get exhausted earlier than expected.
Other than these issues, HP machines are fine.</EM></P>
<P><B>HP Omnibook 6000</B></P>
<P>A laptop computer Omnibook 6000 is equipped with a 'bootable' DVD 
drive and recently, at an ICT conference, I bought a bootable DVD-ROM 
with Mandrake Linux 9.1 installation. After booting the laptop with 
that bootable DVD, it gets directly to the Linux installation menu.</P>

<P><B>HP Vectra VL420 (used as a server)</B></P>
<P>In opposite, an HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it only
has a CD drive), so the direct installation from that particular
installation DVD is not possible. But, an option of making
a bootable floppy disk for starting the installation procedure 
<EM>is</EM> possible. In fact, several boot images are available 
for those users who don't have (bootable or not) DVD drive. One 
of the images is a 'network' one. That means, in a local area network 
there has to be either a NFS, FTP or HTTP server from which the 
installation will take place. </P>

<P><B>HP Vectra VL420 (used as a workstation)</B></P>
<P>Another VL420 desktop system I also use, has a spare HDD from a 
previous Windows 2000 server installation (actually, that IDE disk was moved 
from the other computer where it was a primary one and here it is the second
one disk for backup data). The nice things is that it has a HTTP and FTP 
servers installed (of course, usable if the system is boot from that disk). 
That was good so I could use one of these servers now.</P>
<P>So, I made a 'network' bootable floppy and booted the first Vectra 
VL420 (intended to be a Linux server) with it. After a while, it 
came to a point to choose the installation method (NFS or FTP or 
HTTP server). At first, I wanted to use the second 'spare' HTTP 
server at the other Vectra mentioned above, but regardless of what 
permission I tried to give to the 'Everyone' group of Windows users, 
I always got the following answer from the Linux setup:</P>
<P>Error: Couldn't get file ... (or something like that)</P>
<P>Then I tried to use the FTP 'spare' server from the second Vectra and at
first it also asked for local and remote IP addresses. That time successfully, 
it started to load a part of the remote Linux files into its memory without
any complaint. Soon after, it came to the very same position as Omnibook 
6000 did: it got directly to the installation menu, asking a user to choose 
a language for the installation use.</P>
<P>>From that point, the setup process was almost the same...</P>
<P>I have chosen/confirmed the following items:</P>
<P>- a language to use, besides English(American) as default: I added 
Unicode and Serbian (both Cyrillic and Latin);
- a mouse and keyboard;
- a security level - I accepted defaults: 'Standard' for laptop and 'Higher'
for server;</P>
<P>The next important task was to choose one of <EM>DrakX</EM> 
partitioning options: </P>
<P>- for laptop I chose the 'Use the free space on the Windows
partition', because the laptop has one IDE hard disk and I wanted 
it to use a part of it for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.
already installed). Windows' Disk Management reported: </P>

<P>
<PRE>
Disk 0  15      MB      FAT     (HP Diagnostics or like)
        7.13    GB      FAT32   (C: "HPNOTEBOOK")
        20.80   GB      Free space
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The two partitions (FAT &amp; FAT32) were made during the installation 
procedure using HP's supplied installation CD's.</P>
<P>At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
"was too fragmented" and required me to reboot under Windows, run
the "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.
The defragmentation process have taken cca. 1.5 hour to be completed!
When restarted the setup, it wanted to use 7.13 GB Windows partition, 
instead of 20.80 GB. I chose to 'Use the free space'. Then it made partitions
for Linux: /dev/hda5 and /dev/hda7.</P>
<P>- for Vectra VL420 I used 'Custom disk partitioning' because there 
I had two SCSI disks, one of them running Windows 2000 Server
already installed, and the other one I wanted to use entirely for a
Linux server. BTW, I wasn't sure what the option 'Erase entire disk'
would do during its next step (erase a whole disk or a partition?), 
although it also may be the proper solution too. <EM>DrakX</EM> 
recognized the two SCSI disks as <B>sda</B> and <B>sdb</B> 
and I chose <B>sdb</B> to install Linux. The first step was to 'Clear 
all' and after that to 'Auto allocate' the space on that second disk. 
Finally, after a 'Done' it appeared to make /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb6 
Linux partitions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="LILO.html#toc9.3">Conclusions</A>
</H2>

<P>>From the examples above, you could see that I have been using
various computer forms with also various types of hard disk.
Somewhere there is only one IDE drive, somewhere else there are
two of them, otherwise there are a couple of SCSI drives etc. Regardless 
of that, I always tried to put LILO into the MBR - located on the <EM>first</EM> 
disk. Now it looks like that Linux finally managed to solve the old 
<EM>1024 cyl</EM> problem. In fact, LILO seems to be capable to boot 
Linux regardless it is placed close to the rest of Linux partitions or not.</P>

<P>There are some other considerations related to the experiment above,
but they are part of the other fine document:
