<P>
<P>Since Tcl is an interpreted language, to run a Tcl program (also called
a script), you normally pass the script file to the Tcl interpreter, wish,
for example:
<HR>
<PRE>
wish hello.tcl
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>You can also use wish in interactive mode and type in commands at the command
line.
<P>There's another standard Tcl interpreter, tclsh, which only understands
the Tcl language. Tclsh does not have any of the Tk user interface commands,
so you cannot create graphical programs in tclsh.
<P>Some Tcl freeware applications extend the Tcl language by adding new commands
written as C functions. If such is the case, you need to compile the applicati
on
instead of just passing its Tcl code to the wish interpreter. This application
program, from a Tcl perspective, is really a new version of the wish interpret
er,
which the new C commands linked in. Of course, the application program may
be a lot more than merely a Tcl interpreter. (Note: you can also use Tcl's
auto-loading capability on systems that support it.)

</H2>

<P>
<P>Tcl has a simple structure. Each line starts out with a command, such as
button and a number of arguments. Each command is implemented as if it was
a C function. This function is responsible for handling all the arguments.
<P>
<P>As a very standard example, the following is the Hello World program in
Tcl/Tk:
<HR>
<PRE>
# This is a comment
button .b -text "Hello World" -command exit
pack .b
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>In this case you have to type the commands interactively to tclsh or wish.
<P>You can also place command into script files and invoke these just like
shell scripts. To do this for the previous example, rewrite the Hello World
program as follows:
<HR>
<PRE>
#! /usr/local/bin wish -f
button .b -text "Hello World" -command exit
pack .b
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Put the text inside a file called Hello and make sure that wish is installed
in /usr/local/bin (otherwise you will have to change opportunely the path).
<P>Make the file Hello executable issuing the command
<HR>
<PRE>
chmod 775 Hello
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>and run it inside X.
<P>You will see a button labelled Hello World inside a window: clicking it
will close (exit) the window.
