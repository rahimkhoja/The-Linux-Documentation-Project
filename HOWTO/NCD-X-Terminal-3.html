<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 The X terminal</A>
</H2>

<P>An X terminal is a device which communicates and displays over a network
using a distributed network window system known as X. Typically, the
terminal's X software, known as the X server, is retrieved from the network
at boot time. Programs other then the X server software (X client programs)
are not run locally on the X terminal (with some exceptions); instead, the
X terminal displays programs running on other hosts on the network. The X
terminal, therefore, is a type of network computer which uses the X
protocol to access network resources.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Physical Connection</A>
</H2>

<P> The NCD X terminal (model Xncd19r was used in preparation of this
document) has an RJ-45 (twisted pair) connector for use with 10baseT
Ethernet. A hub is required to link more than two Ethernet devices using
twisted pair. If the X terminal and its host are the only devices in the
network, they may be connected with a 'null' cable which is described in
the Linux Ethernet HOWTO document.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 NCD X server software</A>
</H2>

<P>The terminal's X server software file is available from the manufacturer
and presumably is provided with the terminal upon initial purchase. This
file will reside on the boot host where it can be accessed by the X
terminal when it boots. This file is specific to the terminal type but
independent of boot host. The terminal can boot from any host which
supports the boot communication protocol (explained later). In addition to
X server, the X software may also include applications, like a window
manager, which can run locally on the X terminal itself.
