<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Downloading</A>
</H2>

<P> The CDROM is distributed as a gzip or bzip2 compressed iso image, and is
generally between 95-105MB in size.  ISO images for the sentyrcd-RH branch are
generally much larger, between 150-200MB in size.  Available download mirrors
are listed on the websites; 
<A HREF="http://www.SentryFirewall.com/">http://www.SentryFirewall.com/</A> or
<A HREF="http://Sentry.Sourceforge.net/">http://Sentry.Sourceforge.net/</A>.
<P>
<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Purchasing</A>
</H2>

<P> Although the iso image is free to use and distribute, copies of the Sentry
Firewall CD mailed to you at a minimal cost.  Custom versions of the CD and support
can also be made available and tailored to a specific network configuration.
<P>For more information about these services, please

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Burning the CDROM</A>
</H2>

<P> This section will attempt a general overview on how to burn the CD iso
image once you have obtained it from one of the mirrors.  All the commands
presume you're working in Linux.  Buring ISO images in Windows is not covered
in this howto.  If you are using windows then check out the
<A HREF="http://www.e-smith.org/docs/howto/CD_burning_howto.php3">CD Burning Howto</A><P>First, let's decompress the iso image: <BR>
<B>NOTE:</B> Make sure you have enough disk space, the decompressed iso image can be
somewhere between 250MB and 400MB.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ gzip -d sentrycd.iso.gz

or

blah@wherever:~$ bzip2 -d sentrycd.iso.bz2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Verify the integrity of the iso image,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ md5sum -b sentrycd.iso
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P> Now, let's try to burn the CD.  You'll need the 'cdrecord' utility
available, it can be obtained 
<A HREF="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html">here</A>.
You will want to run 'cdrecord -scanbus' in order to find the 'dev' value
required for the following command.  You will also need to know the write speed
of your CDRW.  Details on how to set this all up are beyond the scope of this
document, please refer to the 
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/CD-Writing-HOWTO.html">CD Writing HOWTO</A>
for more details.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ DEV="DEV_LINE_HERE" SPEED="SPEED"
blah@wherever:~$ cdrecord -v -data speed=$SPEED dev=$DEV sentrycd.iso
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That's it, you now have a Sentry Firewall CDROM.  By the way, you
may have to be 'root' to do all this.
<P>Keep in mind, if you simply want to look at the ISO image without actually
burning the CD, you can mount the image on a loopback device;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
blah@wherever:~$ mount -o loop ./sentrycd.iso /MOUNT_POINT
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Where &quot;MOUNT_POINT&quot; is where you would like the CD mounted.  You may
then 'cd' to the MOUNT_POINT directory and poke around - don't forget to 'umount' the
image once you're finished.  This assumes you have support in your kernel for
the loopback device.  You probably do, but once again, recompiling kernels is
beyond the scope of this document.
