<P>Next, I installed Windows-95 on my office system.  It blew away my nice
Lilo MBR, but it left my Linux partitions alone.  Kernels take a long
time to load from floppy, so I made a floppy with a working Lilo setup
on it, which could boot my kernel from the IDE.</P>
<P>I made the lilo floppy like so:
<PRE>
  fdformat /dev/fd0H1440      #  lay tracks on virgin diskette
  mkfs -t minix /dev/fd0 1440 #  make file system of type minix
  mount /dev/fd0 /mnt         #  mount in the standard tmp mount point
  cp -p /boot/chain.b /mnt    #  copy the chain loader over
  lilo -C /etc/lilo.flop      #  install Lilo and the map on the diskette.
  umount /mnt
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Notice that the diskette <B>must be mounted when you run the
installer</B> so that Lilo can write its map file properly.</P>

<P>This file is /etc/lilo.flop.  It's almost the same as the last one:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
#  Makes a floppy that can boot kernels from HD.
boot = /dev/fd0
map = /mnt/lilo-map
delay = 100
ramdisk = 0
timeout = 100
prompt
disk = /dev/hda     # 1 GB IDE, BIOS only sees first 500 MB.
   bios=0x80
   sectors = 63
   heads = 16
   cylinders = 2100
image = /vmlinuz
  append = "hd=2100,16,63"
  root = /dev/hda2
  label = linux
  read-only
  vga = extended
other = /dev/hda1
  label = msdos
  table = /dev/hda
  loader = /mnt/chain.b
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Finally, I needed MS-DOS 6.2 on my office system, but I didn't
want to touch the first drive.  I added a SCSI controller and
drive, made an msdos file system on it with Linux' mkdosfs, and
Windows-95 sees it as "D:".   But of course MSDOS will not boot 
off of D:.  This is not a problem when you have Lilo.  I added
the following to the <CODE>lilo.conf</CODE> in Example 2.  </P>
<P>
<PRE>
other = /dev/sda1
  label = d6.2
  table = /dev/sda
  loader = /boot/any_d.b
</PRE>
</P>
<P>With this modification MSDOS-6.2 runs, and it thinks it is on C: and
Windows-95 is on D:.</P>
