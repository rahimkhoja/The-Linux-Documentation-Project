</H2>

<P> By using two modems at the same time, the flow of data can be
doubled.  It takes two modems and two phone lines.  There are two
methods of doing this.  One is "modem bonding" where software at both
ends of the modem-to-modem connection enables the paired modems to
work like a single channel.</P>
<P>The second method is called "modem teaming.  Only one end of the
connection uses software to make 2 different connections to the
internet.  Then when a file is to be downloaded, one modem gets the
first half of the file.  The second modems simultaneously gets the
last half of the same file by pretending that it's resuming a download
that was interrupted in the middle of the file.  Is there any modem
teaming support in Linux ??</P>

</H2>

<P> There are two ways to do this in Linux: EQL and multilink.  These
are provided as part of the Linux kernel (provided they've been
selected when the kernel was compiled).  For multilink the kernel
must be at least v.2.4.  Both ends of the connection must run them.
Few (if any) ISPs provide EQL but many provide Multilink.</P>
<P>The way it works is something like multiplexing only it's the other
way around.  Thus it's called inverse-multiplexing.  For the multilink
case, suppose you're sending some packets.  The first packet goes out on
modem1 while the second packet is going out on modem2.  Then the third
packet follows the first packet on modem1.  The forth packet goes on
modem2, etc.  To keep each modem busy, it may be necessary to send out
more packets on one modem than the other.  Since EQL is not packet
based, it doesn't split up the flow on packet boundaries.</P>

<H3>EQL</H3>

<P>EQL is "serial line load balancing" which has been available for
Linux since at least 1995.  An old (1995) howto on it is in the kernel
documentation (in the networking subdirectory).  Unfortunately, ISPs
don't seem to provide EQL.</P>

<H3>Multilink</H3>

<P> Staring with kernel 2.4 in 2000, experimental support is provided
for multilink.  It must be selected when compiling the kernel and it
only works with PPP.    </P>
