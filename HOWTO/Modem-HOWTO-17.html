<P> To use ISDN you must have a special ISDN telephone line supplied
by your telephone company at additional cost.  An ISDN "modem" is
really a Terminal Adapter (TA).  Like analog modems, there are
internal ones on cards and external ones that connect to serial ports.</P>

</H2>

<P>Configuring an external ISDN modem on a serial port is about the
same as configuring an analog modem.  The main difference is in the
init string.  Unfortunately, the init strings are different for
different models of ISDN modems.  There is often one AT command for a
speed of 64k and another for 128k, etc.  So you need to find out what
init string to use and tell it to say wvdial, etc.</P>

<P>Support for some of these cards can be built into the 2.4 or 2.6
kernels or added as a module.  The tty ports are ttyI2 for example.
The kernel documentation has an "isdn" subdirectory which describes
various drivers which support various isdn cards.  A major website for
ISDN is

<P>For configuring, one might use the "isdn-config" GUI.  A Debian
package "isdnutils" is available.  There is SuSE ISDN Howto (not a LDP
Howto) which is translated from German

isdn4linux package and a newsgroup: de.alt.comm.isdn4linux.  Many of
the postings are in German.  </P>
