<P>This is just a collection of what I believe are the most common
questions people might have. Give me more feedback and I will
turn this section into a proper FAQ.

<UL>
<LI>Q:Why don't I get audio when playing back recorded programs?
<P>A: This could be due to several things.  In order for audio recording to work,
you must have the tuner card send output to the 'line-in' on your sound card.
You must also use the mixer to enable the line-in on the sound card (if you hear
sound while recording the show, it is probably enabled).  I used to have my tuner
card sound sent to my stereo receiver instead of the sound card, which was why I
didn't get sound.  Finally, it may be that the sound was record properly, but your
sound device is in use by another program (esd, licq, xmms, etc).

<LI>Q: Why is my video very jumpy?
<P>A: This may be due to a slow CPU.  I currently haven't determined the exact
requirements for recording with this method, I'm hoping user feedback will help
me figure out what CPU is indeed required.  I have a Duron 700 that seems to work
fine, but I've heard that people with a 200-500mhz processor are unable to get
smooth video.

</LI>
<LI>Q: Why is the audio/video out of sync?
<P>A: This may be due to an incorrect FPS setting for your video type.  For NTSC
you will want to use 29.97.  For PAL you will want to use 25.  I still don't
get perfect audio/video synchronization - but I can live with it.  Hopefully this
will improve over time.
