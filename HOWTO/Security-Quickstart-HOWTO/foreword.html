> Before getting into specifics, let's try to briefly answer some questions
 about why we need to be concerned about security in the first place. &#13;</P
><P
> It is easy to see why an e-commerce site, an on-line bank, or a government 
 agency with sensitive documents would be concerned about security. But what
 about the average user? Why should even a Linux home Desktop user worry about
 security? &#13;</P
><P
> Anyone connected to the Internet is a target, plain and simple. It
 makes little difference whether you have a part-time dialup connection, or a
 full-time connection, though full-time connections make for bigger targets.
 Larger sites make for bigger targets too, but this does not let small users
 off the hook since the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"small user"</SPAN
> may be less skilled and thus
 an easier victim. 
 &#13;</P
><P
> There are those out there that are scanning just for easy
 victims all the time. If you start logging unwanted connection attempts, 
 you will see this soon enough. There is little doubt that many of these
 attempts are maliciously motivated and the attacker, in some cases, is
 looking for Linux boxes to crack. Does someone on the other side of the globe
 really want to borrow my printer? &#13;</P
><P
> What do they want? Often, they just may want your computer, your IP
 address, and your bandwidth. Then they use you to either attack others, or
 possibly commit crimes or mischief and are hiding their true identity behind
 you. This is an all too common scenario. Commercial and high-profile sites
 are targeted more directly and have bigger worries, but we all face this type
 of common threat. &#13;</P
><P
> With a few reasonable precautions, Linux can be very
 secure, and with all the available tools, makes for a fantastically fun and
 powerful Internet connection or server. Most successful break-ins are the
 result of ignorance or carelessness. &#13;</P

 would be a bare bones installation, with <EM

 our systems would connect via this dedicated router/firewall system. If we
 wanted publicly accessible servers (web, mail, etc), these would be in a

 This would require a minimum of two computers. Or three, if you would be 
 running any publicly available servers (not a good idea initially). Or maybe
 you are just new to Linux, and don't know your way around well enough yet. So
 if we can't do the ideal installation, we will do the next best thing.&#13;</P

 </P
><P
>  
 First, one of the interesting aspects of Linux, is the different
 distributions like Caldera, Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian. While these are all 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Linux"</SPAN
>, and may share certain features, there is surely some
 differences as to what utilities they may install as defaults. Most Linux 
 distributions will write their own system configuration tools as well. And with
 Linux, there is always more than one way to skin a cat. But for the purposes
 of our discussion, we will have to use as generic set of tools as we can.
 Unfortunately, GUI tools don't lend themselves to this type of documentation. 
 We will be using text based, command line tools for the most part. If you 
 are familiar with your distribution's utilities, feel free to substitute
 those in appropriate places. And if not, you should learn them or suitable 
 alternatives.&#13;</P

 recommended procedures as you read along. This is the

    are two relatively easy to use editors if you don't already have a
    favorite. There is a quick guide to <A

    always a good idea to make a back up copy, before editing system
    configuration files.

    services from running on each boot. Also, how they install (and uninstall)
    packages (<B

    to find the updates for your release. This information is available in
