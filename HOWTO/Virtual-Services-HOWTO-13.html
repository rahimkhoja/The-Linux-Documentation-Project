<P><B>Q1</B>. I created sendmail.init and syslogd.init.  I put them in /usr/local/bin and tried to 
run them but I got errors.
<P>
<P><B>A1</B>. These files are called init scripts.  They are run by the program init when
your computer boots.  They do not go with the /usr/local binaries.  Consult the
Linux System Administrators Guide or the Linux Getting Started Guide for information
on how to use the init scripts system.
<P>
<P><B>Q2</B>. I put these lines into /etc/sendmail.cf
<P>
<PRE>
divert(0)
VERSIONID(`tcpproto.mc')                        
OSTYPE(linux)

FEATURE(always_add_domain)
FEATURE(use_cw_file)
FEATURE(local_procmail)
MAILER(local)
MAILER(smtp)
</PRE>
<P>And I got really stange output.  Why?
<P>
<P><B>A2</B>. You do not put these lines directly in /etc/sendmail.cf.  The sendmail.cf
file was written to be easy for sendmail to understand and hard for humans to read. 
Therefore, to make it easy to configure we use a program called m4 and its macro 
capabilities to create the sendmail.cf file.  The FEATURE lines are actually macros 
that expand to sendmail configuration statements.   See the sendmail docs on how to 
configure sendmail through this method.  Also note that you create a main 
/etc/sendmail.cf file and the virtfs script then copies this to 
/virtual/domain1.com/etc/sendmail.cf.  Then you edit that sendmail.cf file to
respond as your domain.  
<P>
<P><B>Q3</B>. Where do I get virtuald, what is it, and how do I use it?
<P>
<P><B>A3</B>. Virtuald is C source that I wrote to run a virtual service.  
It is included with this HOWTO.  You compile it like a normal C program 
<CODE> make virtuald </CODE>.  The resulting binary is placed into
/usr/local/bin.  Add lines to /etc/inetd.conf that use virtuald as a wrapper to a normal
network server program.
<P>
<P><B>Q4</B>. I do not have dialog installed on my system?
<P>
<P><B>A4</B>. Dialog is a program that allows you to put dialog pop up windows
into your shell scripts.  It is required for my virtual shell script
examples to work.  You can get a copy of dialog at
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/shell/cdialog-0.9a.tar.gz">sunsite</A>.  
It compiles very easily and should be no problem to install.
<P>
<P><B>Q5</B>. How can I know if virtual syslogd is working?
<P>
<P><B>A5</B>. When virtuald runs it should output the following messages to
syslogd (/var/log/messages):
<P>
<PRE>
Nov 19 17:21:07 virtual virtuald[10223]: Virtuald Starting: $Revision: 1.49 $
Nov 19 17:21:07 virtual virtuald[10223]: Incoming ip: 204.249.11.136
Nov 19 17:21:07 virtual virtuald[10223]: Chroot dir: /virtual/domain1.com
</PRE>
<P>The <CODE> Chroot </CODE> dir message is sent by virtuald after the <CODE> chroot </CODE> system 
call is performed.  If this message appears virtual syslogd is working.   If the
service you are virtualizing logs messages to syslogd and you see them that
is also a sign that virtual syslogd is correctly setup.
<P>
<P>Note that if you have not turned on the compile time option VERBOSELOG, 
virtuald will not log at all.  The only way to tell if virtual syslogd is
working at that point is if the daemon you are virtualizing independently
logs something to syslogd.
<P>
<P><B>Q6</B>.  How can I setup quotas across virtual filesystems?
<P>
<P><B>A6</B>.  You setup quotas like you would normally.  See the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Quota.html">Quota mini-HOWTO</A>.  
However, you have to make sure there are no uid conflicts across domains.  If there are
conflicts you will have users sharing a quota.  Set aside a range of uid's that you know will
have quota's enabled and tell your domains that they cannot have any users in that range except the
ones registered to have a quota.  
<P>
<P><B>Q7</B>.  What is this \ notation in all the inetd.conf entries?
<P>
<P><B>A7</B>.  That is just a method of breaking up config files across two lines.
I did that so the line would word wrap in a nice place.  You can just ignore the \
and join the two lines back together.
<P>
<P><B>Q8</B>.  When I run passwd or other login programs I get <CODE> permission denied </CODE>.  
When I run FTP or su I get <CODE> no modules loaded for service XXX </CODE>.  Why?
<P>
<P><B>A8</B>.  Those are PAM error messages.  I wrote these scripts before PAM was out.  
My virtfs script does not copy /etc/pam.d, /usr/lib/cracklib_dict.*, /lib/security or any of the
other files PAM requires.  PAM needs these to function.  If you edit my virtfs 
script to copy these files the problem will go away.
<P>
<P><B>Q9</B>.  Can virtuald work with tcpd hosts.allow and hosts.deny files?
<P>
<P><B>A9</B>.  Yes it can with some modifications.  
<P>
<P>First the source has to be changed in two places.  
<P>
<P>This has to be inserted where the arguments are checked.
<P>
<PRE>
        if (!argv[3])
        {
                syslog(LOG_ERR,"invalid arguments: no program to run");
                exit(0);
        }
</PRE>
<P>The exec line has to be changed from:
<P>
<PRE>
        if (execvp(argv[2],argv+2)&lt;0)
</PRE>
<P>to:
<P>
<PRE>
        if (execvp(argv[2],argv+3)&lt;0)
</PRE>
<P>Second the inetd.conf lines have to be changed from:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/bin/virtuald \
        virtuald /virtual/conf.ftp wu.ftpd -l -a
</PRE>
<P>to:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/bin/virtuald \
        virtuald /virtual/conf.ftp tcpd wu.ftpd -l -a
</PRE>
<P>Third edit the /virtual/domain1.com/etc/hosts.allow and
/virtual/domain1.com/etc/hosts.deny files accordingly.
<P>
<P><B>Q10</B>.  Can my virtual hosts run CGI's?
<P>
<P><B>A10</B>.  Yes they can but I recommend putting the /cgi-bin in a place
outside of the <CODE> chroot </CODE> that only you have access to.  For example, 
/var/www/cgi-bin/domain1.com.  Giving clients access to /cgi-bin is giving them
the opportunity to run programs on your sever.  This is a big security hole.  Be
careful.  I do not let any cgi run on my systems that I have not personally
inspected for bugs.
<P>
<P><B>Q11</B>.  My configuration files are different from your examples.   What do I do?
<P>
<P><B>A11</B>.  There are two basic configuration styles: SystemV and BSD.  The examples provided
in the HOWTO are based on SystemV style configuration files.  Virtual services works equally
well on either system.  For information on BSD style configuration files consult the origin
of your distribution or the nearest LDP site.
<P>
<P><B>Q12</B>.  I sent you mail and have not heard a response from you or your response
took a long time.  Why?
<P>
<P><B>A12</B>.  Probably because you did not put VIRTSERVICES HOWTO in your subject header.
Please bear in mind that I am a network administrator and that among the other things I do
in my 20 hour days is administering my own virtual boxes and those of my clients.  Mail
that is properly addressed is always responded to within two or three days.  Mail that is improperly
addressed does not get filtered into my VIRTSERVICES mailbox and can lie around unnoticed for
days or weeks.
<P>
<P><B>Q13</B>.  Does virtuald work under 100Mbit?
<P>
<P><B>A13</B>   The speed of the network card is unrelated to whether virtuald will work or
not.  Try making sure that your server works under 10Mbit and that your 100Mbit network card 
works normally without a virtual server.
<P>
<P><B>Q14</B>.  Should I use sendmail's virthost table?
<P>
<P><B>A14</B>.  No.  That is sendmail's feature to accept info for multiple domains.  Virtuald
gives each sendmail its own separate <CODE> chroot </CODE> environment.  Install virtuald and then configure
sendmail like you would normally for each domain.
<P>
<P><B>Q15</B>.  Can I setup virtual telnet on my machine?  What about creating
a virtual root account so clients can administer their own domains?
<P>
<P><B>A15</B>.  These questions come to me quite often and to be honest, I am getting
a bit tired of them.  The answer, as stated numerous times in the documentation, is
that any service run through inetd can be virtualized using virtuald so there is
nothing to stop you from doing either of the above.  Nothing except common sense.
Whatever benefits you might derive from allowing telnet are heavily outweighed
by the cost to the virtual box (and thus the sites you are supposed to be 
hosting in a responsible manner) in terms of security.  Here are just a few
issues involved:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> In order to completely fool an incoming telnet session you have to hack the kernel
to get multiple procs working, reset your source IP address for outgoing connections,
fool gethostname so it uses the virtual hostname and not the system hostname, etc.
If you are an advanced user then by all means hack the kernel.  For the newbie I do not
recommend it.</LI>
<LI> By allowing users to come into your box via telnet you allow them to run arbitrary
programs.  Through known hacks you can get root and cause damage to the system.</LI>
<LI> Giving a root telnet account on a virtual box is very bad.  A root virtual user
can still read raw device files which nullifies the <CODE> chroot </CODE>, shutdown the system, and
can kill other processes on the system.</LI>
<LI> The programs that these telnet sessions are running take up valuable CPU time
that the network services could be using.</LI>
<LI> Telnet is an insecure network service.  Plain text passwords are sent out over
the net.  If a malicious user gets this password he/she can use the above mentioned
attacks to harm your system.</LI>
<LI> Your virtual environments will have to be bigger.  You will need more shared 
libraries, more configuration files, and more binaries.  A six gigabyte disk can
run out of space really fast.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The bottom line is that allowing login's on a virtual box is a really bad idea.  If
permitted, every site hosted on that machine is at risk.  If you want to allow a site
holder to administer users then you are advised to write (not script) the code
necessary to run the virtual processes that allow them to add, delete or modify users
upon login through ssh.  This should be completely menu driven, should never allow a console
and should not run as root.  In order to accomplish this you will have to change
ownership of the pertinent files from root to some other user.  If done in this manner
it is marginally safe to incorporate into a virtual machine.  There is never an
acceptable time to allow root login's either through telnet or ssh.  Doing so is
simply an invitation to disaster.  If there is an overwhelming reason to run telnet
then the site should be hosted on a dedicated machine where the only risk is to the
individual site.  No responsible administrator would ever do otherwise and so I will
waste no more time on this issue.
<P>
<P><B>Q16</B>.  Is there an rpm, tar, web site, mailing list, etc. associated with
virtuald and the Virtual-Services HOWTO?
<P>
<P><B>A16</B>.  Currently there is nothing like that available.  This HOWTO is the
only source of information to everything I do concerning this project.  I find
the HOWTO to be fairly self contained making the need for other pieces of information
superfluous.
<P>
<P><B>Q17</B>.  When I try to run virtexec as a regular user I get <CODE> chroot: operation not permitted </CODE>.  Why?
<P>
<P><B>A17</B>.  <CODE> Chroot </CODE> is a root restricted system call.  Only the superuser can execute
it.  The virtexec script runs the <CODE> chroot </CODE> program which is why you need to be root
in order to run it.
<P>
<P><B>Q18</B>.  I setup pop and sendmail but popping mail does not seem to
work.  How come? 
<P>
<P><B>A18</B>.  Some pop programs come with /usr/spool/mail as their place for mail
files.  I know that qpop has to be manually editted to fix this.  Either recompile
the source to your program or symlink /virtual/domain1.com/usr/spool to 
/virtual/domain1.com/var/spool.
<P>
<P><B>Q19</B>.  I did not use the program mentioned in your HOWTO, I used program
XXX.  It does not work.  Why?
<P>
<P><B>A19</B>.  I tried to make sure to use the most generic of each server in
my examples.  However, I know that everyone has their favorite version of each
server.   Send me as much information as possible and I will try to figure out
how to solve your problem and document it in the FAQ.  The most important
piece of information to send me is where to get the version of the software
you are running (in the form ftp://ftp.domain1.com/subdir/subdir/file.tgz).
<P>
<P><B>Q20</B>.  When I run virtexec is says <CODE> symlink not a virt function </CODE>.
What does this mean and how do I fix it?
<P>
<P><B>A20</B>.  Virtexec is a program that will take its zero argument, strip 
off the first four characters, and run the remaining name in the virtual
environment.  For example, virtpasswd runs passwd.  If the first four characters
that it strips off are not <CODE> virt </CODE> it complains and outputs that
error message.  Virtexec is written in shell script and should be fairly simple
to follow.  Refer to the manual pages on bash or whatever shell you run for 
questions about shell script programming.
<P>
<P><B>Q21</B>.  I have a question about Qmail, SAMBA, Apache, etc. that is unrelated
to the virtuald setup or how the package interfaces to virtuald.
<P>
<P><B>A21</B>.  All the packages described here are fully documented.  Some even
have full web sites like www.packagename.org dedicated to them.  Please
consult them about questions dealing with the package that are unrelated to their
virtual hosting functionality.
<P>
<P><B>Q22</B>.  I have several domain aliases to domain1.com but mail keeps bouncing
from the aliases.   How come?
<P>
<P><B>A22</B>.  Virtmaildelivery relies on the environment variables passed to it to
determine which /virtual/domain1.com directory to deliver to.  It does
not perform any DNS lookups to determine the address of the mail.  However,
if the address is submail.mail.domain1.com, virtmaildelivery will
first try that address and then mail.domain1.com and then domain1.com and
then com in that order until either a match happens or there is no domain name 
left.  
<P>
<P>However, if you have domain aliases that are not subdomains of one
another you have to create symlinks like so:
<P>
<PRE>
cd /virtual
ln -s domain1.com domain1alias.com
</PRE>
<P>That way virtmaildelivery will be fooled into thinking that both directories
exist even though one is a symlink and mail will be able to be delivered to 
user@domain1.com or user@domain1alias.com.  Note that virtexec will list both of
the domains in the dialog box when your run it.  You can choose either one
since they will be the same virtual filesystem.
