<P>The procmail config file is at &nbsp;/.procmailrc.  If you don't already
have a procmailrc file, just create one.
<P>
<P>Make an entry for each mailing list that is to be gated to your local
news server.  Something like this will do the trick for most cases,
but might fail for mail Bcc'd to the mailing list.
<P>
<P>For example if your mailing list is 'jokes@netizen.com.au' and you
want the newsgroup to be called 'lists.jokes' your entry would look
like this:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
:0
* TOjokes@netizen.com.au
|/usr/local/bin/mail2news lists.jokes
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Note there's no space between the 'TO' and the list address on the
second line.
<P>
<P>You need to put a blank line between the lines for each group.  Put as
many entries as you want, using the same 3 lines for each group, but
changing the list address and newsgroup.
