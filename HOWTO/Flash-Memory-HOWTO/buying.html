><P
>&#13;    The established brands have web sites in which this may be stated
    explicitly. Alternatively, ask the supplier. But beware: the sales
    person may not know what you are talking about. The instruction
    leaflet may also mention something like: Works on Linux-2.4, or
    may have a picture of the Linux penguin. If these inquiries fail, it
    may be wise not to buy.

><P
>&#13;    Memory sticks usually are packaged with an extension cable 
    (<A
HREF="physical.html"
>Section 2</A
>) and a keychain. The latter provides
    a safe and with-it way of transporting the device. Make sure that
    these are included. You may need an additional extension cable,
    depending on circumstances. Laptop and notebook computers usually
    don't need them.

><P
>&#13;    Over-the-counter memory sticks are usually formatted in vfat
    (msdos), and this will work in Linux, but you will not have the
    strength and versatility of the standard ext2 (or other) file
    system. This is not a problem. It can be endowed with other file
    systems as will be described later in this document.

    is a good idea to find out what that range is. The internet is
    excellent for the purpose.
