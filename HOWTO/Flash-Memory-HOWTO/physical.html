>&#13;    Flash memory devices come mainly in the form of small, portable
    devices often referred to as <EM
>memory sticks</EM
> or
    <EM
>keychains</EM
>, and as part of digital
    cameras. They are <EM
>non-volatile devices</EM
> which
    operate on the principle that electric charges are used to
    represent data in binary format. These charges can remain
    unchanged almost indefinitely, but changes (such as writing to the
    device) limit the life span of the device (100000 writes of 8MB
    each).

    Memory sticks plug directly into a USB-port at the back of your
    computer. The power it needs is supplied by the USB-port. It is
    sometimes convenient to use a USB-extension cable to bring the
    device within easy reach. 
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Memory sticks usually have <EM
>write protect
    switches</EM
> which should be turned off if you want to use
    it as read-write device. If the switch is in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"on"</SPAN
> position,
    the device is <EM
>read-only</EM
>. The devices are
    usually equipped with a led (light emitting diode), which
    indicates that the device is operational. The led also flickers
    while data is being transferred to or from the device.

>&#13;    Digital cameras use flash memory for image storage. These are 
    powered by the camera and connected to the computer's USB-port via
    an electronic interface. To be able to connect to the computer,
    the camera's power must be turned on for the duration of the
    interfacing, and should only be turned off after the device had
    been unmounted from the computer. It is important to remember that
    the device takes power from the camera's battery. The operation
    should therefore be terminated as soon as possible.
