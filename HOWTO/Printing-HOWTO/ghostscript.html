>Ghostscript</A
> is
an incredibly significant program for free software-driven
printing.  Most printing software under Unix generates PostScript,
which is typically a $100 option on a printer.  Ghostscript,
however, is free, and will generate the language of your printer
from PostScript.</P
><P
>Ghostscript is available in several forms.  The commercial version of
Ghostscript, called Aladdin Ghostscript, may be used freely for
personal use but may not be distributed by commercial entities.  It
is generally a year or so ahead of the free Ghostscript; at the
moment, for example, it supports many color inkjets that the older
Ghostscripts do not and has rather better PDF support.</P
><P
>The main free version of Ghostscript is GNU Ghostscript, and is
simply an aged version of Aladdin ghostscript.  This somewhat
awkward arrangement has allowed Aladdin to be a totally self-funded
free software project; the leading edge versions are done by L
Peter and a few employees, and are licensed to hardware and
software vendors for use in commercial products.  Unfortunately,
while this scheme has provided for L Peter's continued work on
Ghostscript for years, it has also inhibited the participation of
the wider free software community.  Driver authors, in particular,
find the arrangement poor.  L Peter's retirement plans mandate a
larger community involvement in the project, so he is considering
license changes, and has established a SourceForge project.</P
><P
>The third version of Ghostscript is ESP Ghostscript, maintained by
Easy Software Products (authors of CUPS) under contract from Epson.
ESP Ghostscript is a combination of the gimp-print driver project's
drivers and GNU Ghostscript, plus assorted usability patches.  This
version is not yet in full swing, but it will be available soon,
and will hopefully simplify life for owners of Gimp-print-driven
printers.</P

file access (<TT
CLASS="option"
>-dSAFER</TT
>).  PostScript is a fully
functional language, and a bad PostScript program could give you
quite a headache.</P
><P
>Speaking of PDF, Adobe's Portable Document Format (at least through
1.3) is actually little more than organized PostScript in a
compressed file.  Ghostscript can handle PDF input just as it does
PostScript.  So you can be the first on your block with a
PDF-capable printer.</P

>The location, size, and aspect ratio of the image on a page is
controlled by the printer-specific driver in ghostscript.  If you
find that your pages are coming out scrunched too short, or too
long, or too big by a factor of two, you might want to look in
your driver's source module and adjust whatever parameters jump
out at you.  Unfortunately, each driver is different, so I can't
really tell you what to adjust, but most of them are reasonably
well commented.</P

>Most non-laser printers suffer from the fact that their dots are
rather large. This results in pictures coming out too dark. If
you experience this problem with an otherwise untunable driver,
you could use your own transfer function.  Simply create the
following file in the ghostscript lib-dir and add its name to the
gs call just before the actual file. You may need to tweak the
actual values to fit your printer. Lower values result in a
brighter print.  Especially if your driver uses a Floyd-Steinberg
algorithm to rasterize colors, lower values ( 0.2 - 0.15 ) are
probably a good choice.</P

><P
>For many of the newer color inkjet drivers, there are
command-line options, or different upp driver files, which
implement gamma and other changes to adapt the printer to
different paper types.  You should look into this before playing
with Postscript to fix things.</P

>10.2.3. Color Printing in Ghostscript</H3
><P
>Ghostscript's default color dithering is optimized for
low-resolution devices.  It will dither rather coarsely in an
attempt to produce 60ppi output (not dpi, ppi - the "apparent"
color pixels per inch you get after dithering).  This produces
rather poor output on modern color printers; inkjets with photo
paper, in particular, are capable of much finer ppi settings.</P
><P
>To adjust this, use the Ghostscript option<TT
CLASS="option"
>-dDITHERPPI=x</TT
>, where <TT
CLASS="option"
>x</TT
> is the
value to use.  This may or may not have an effect with all
drivers; many newer drivers (the Epson Stylus<B
CLASS="command"
>stp</B
> driver, for example) implement their own
dithering and pay no attention to this setting.  Some drivers can
use either the regular Ghostscript or driver-specific dithering
     (the Canon Bubblejet <B
CLASS="command"
>bjc600</B
> driver, for
example).</P
><P
>Ghostscript's dithering is in fact rather rudimentary.  Many
things needed for good output on modern printers are simply not
available in the Ghostscript core.  Various projects to fix this
situation&#8212;and the free software world does have the
software to do so ready and waiting&#8212;are hampered by
Ghostscript's licensing situation and the resulting "cathedral"
development style.  Beginning at the <A

>, however, all the necessary people are
talking, so you can expect this situation to improve shortly.</P
