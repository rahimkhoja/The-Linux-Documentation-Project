>Here we get into a real rat's-nest of software.  Basically, Linux
can run many types of binaries with varying degrees of success:
Linux/x86, Linux/Alpha, Linux/Sparc, Linux/foo, iBCS, Win16/Win32s
   (with dosemu and, someday, with Wine), Mac/68k (with Executor), and
Java.  I'll just discuss native GNU/Linux and common Un*x software.</P

>This was one of the first markup languages on the

are the most common examples of things formatted in *roff
macros; many people swear by them, but nroff has, to me at
least, a more arcane syntax than needed (see <A
HREF="authoring.html#roff-example"
>Figure 12</A
>), and probably makes a poor choice for
new works.  It is worth knowing, though, that you can typeset
a man page directly into postscript with groff.  Most man
commands will do this for you with <B

>TeX, and the macro package LaTeX, are one of the most
widely used markup languages on Un*x systems, although TeX did
not originate on Unix and is available to run on a wide
variety of systems.  Technical works are frequently written in
LaTeX because it greatly simplifies the layout issues and is<EM
>still</EM
> one of the few text processing
systems to support mathematics both completely and well.
TeX's output format is <TT

>dvi</TT
>, and is
converted to PostScript or Hewlett Packard's PCL with <B
CLASS="command"
>dvips</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>dvilj</B
>.  If you
wish to install TeX or LaTeX, install the whole teTeX group of
packages; it contains everything.  Recent TeX installations
include pdfTeX and pdfLaTeX, which produce Adobe PDF files
directly.  Commands are available do create hyperlinks and
navigation features in the PDF file.</P

>&#13;\subsubsection{NAT}

Each real server is assigned a different IP address, and the NA
implements address translation for all inbound and outbound
packets.

  \begin{description}
  \item[Advantage] Implementation simplicity, especially if we
already implement other NAT capabilities.

  \item[Disadvantage] Return traffic from the server goes through
address translation, which may incur a speed penalty.  This
probably isn't too bad if we design for it from the
beginning.

  \item[Disadvantage] NAT breaks the end-to-end semantics of normal
internet traffic.  Protocols like ftp, H.323, etc would
require special support involving snooping and in-stream
rewriting, or complete protocol proxying; neither is likely
to be practical.
