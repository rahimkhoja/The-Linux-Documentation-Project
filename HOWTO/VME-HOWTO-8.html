<P>VMELinux and the other Linux on VME efforts offer the user a low cost way to implement a VMEbus system quickly, reliably and with all the advantages of a unix environment.  We are using VMELinux in our projects.  Our task list includes:
<UL>
<LI>Porting to other brands of Intel VMEbus boards,</LI>
<LI>Porting of VMELinux to other processors that use the Universe chip,</LI>
<LI>Creation of various slave board drivers for use by all VMELinux users,</LI>
<LI>A study of running the VMELinux kernel driver module as a RT-Linux task.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This document outlines the steps you need to install the VMELinux Kernel Driver into the example Xycom XVME-655 Pentium VME board.  It is our hope that others will attempt installation of VMELinux into other boards and let us know their success.
<P>
<P>This method of code development works best when the users tell us of their successes and describe the equipment used.  Please, please drop a note to the 
<A HREF="http://lists.va.net/mailman/listinfo/vmelinux-users">VMELinux Mail List</A> and share your experience with others.
<P>Send bug reports and feature requrests to the 
<A HREF="http://bugs.vmelinux.org/">VMELinux Project Bug Tracker</A>.  If you have a question or an update to this document send email to
