<P>Well, as it name implies a wearable is a computer you are supposed to
wear, actually very few wearables fill this definition. On a more
practical point of view one can define a wearable as a computer you can
use on the run relying only on its  power supply ( see the power
supply section for more information ). So with such a definition PDAs, 
palmcomputers, customized laptops are wearables too. As Wearable
computing is a new field, there is no standard definition for a
Wearable computer, but you may find Professor Steve Mann's definition very
. To me medical devices such as pacemakers too are Wearable computers
and they don't fit in Professor Steve Mann's 
<A HREF="http://wearcomp.org/wearcompdef.html">definition</A> 
( actually Professor Steve Mann is one of the Pionneers in Wearable
computing ) On the Wearcomp website there is also a  
<A HREF="http://wearcomp.org/wearcompfaq.html"> FAQ </A> trying to
define what a Wearable is.  
<P>I am not a specialist in wearables, simply I have a very strong
interest in nomadic computing and I studying a lot its implementations
both from a technical point of view and from the way nomadic computing
is going to change our every day life and the way we interacts as we
are getting more and more connected.
