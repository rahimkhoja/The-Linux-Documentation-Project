>Chapter 8. Multicast routing</H1
><P
>FIXME: Editor Vacancy!</P
><P
>The Multicast-HOWTO is ancient (relatively-speaking) and may be inaccurate
or misleading in places, for that reason.</P
><P
>Before you can do any multicast routing, you need to configure the Linux
kernel to support the type of multicast routing you want to do. This, in
turn, requires you to decide what type of multicast routing you expect to
be using. There are essentially four "common" types - DVMRP (the Multicast
version of the RIP unicast protocol), MOSPF (the same, but for OSPF), PIM-SM
("Protocol Independent Multicasting - Sparse Mode", which assumes that users
of any multicast group are spread out, rather than clumped) and PIM-DM (the
same, but "Dense Mode", which assumes that there will be significant clumps
of users of the same multicast group).</P
><P
>In the Linux kernel, you will notice that these options don't appear. This is
because the protocol itself is handled by a routing application, such as
Zebra, mrouted, or pimd. However, you still have to have a good idea of which
you're going to use, to select the right options in the kernel.</P
><P
>For all multicast routing, you will definitely need to enable "multicasting"
and "multicast routing". For DVMRP and MOSPF, this is sufficient. If you are
going to use PIM, you must also enable PIMv1 or PIMv2, depending on whether
the network you are connecting to uses version 1 or 2 of the PIM protocol.</P
><P
>Once you have all that sorted out, and your new Linux kernel compiled, you
will see that the IP protocols listed, at boot time, now include IGMP. This
is a protocol for managing multicast groups. At the time of writing, Linux
supports IGMP versions 1 and 2 only, although version 3 does exist and has
been documented. This doesn't really affect us that much, as IGMPv3 is still
new enough that the extra capabilities of IGMPv3 aren't going to be that
much use. Because IGMP deals with groups, only the features present in the
simplest version of IGMP over the entire group are going to be used. For the
most part, that will be IGMPv2, although IGMPv1 is sill going to be
encountered.</P
><P
>So far, so good. We've enabled multicasting. Now, we have to tell the Linux
kernel to actually do something with it, so we can start routing. This means
adding the Multicast virtual network to the router table:</P
><P
>ip route add 224.0.0.0/4 dev eth0</P
><P
>(Assuming, of course, that you're multicasting over eth0! Substitute the
device of your choice, for this.)</P
><P
>Now, tell Linux to forward packets...</P
><P
>echo 1 &#62; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</P
><P
>At this point, you may be wondering if this is ever going to do anything. So,
to test our connection, we ping the default group, 224.0.0.1, to see if anyone
is alive. All machines on your LAN with multicasting enabled <EM
>should</EM
>
respond, but nothing else. You'll notice that none of the machines that
respond have an IP address of 224.0.0.1. What a surprise! :) This is a group
address (a "broadcast" to subscribers), and all members of the group will
respond with their own address, not the group address.</P
><P
>ping -c 2 224.0.0.1</P
><P
>At this point, you're ready to do actual multicast routing. Well, assuming
that you have two networks to route between.</P
><P
>(To Be Continued!)</P
