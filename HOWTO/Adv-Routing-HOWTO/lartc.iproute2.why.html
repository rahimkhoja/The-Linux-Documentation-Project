>Most Linux distributions, and most UNIX's, currently use the 
venerable <B

CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifconfig</B

<B

While these tools work, they show some unexpected behaviour under Linux 2.2 
and up.
For example, GRE tunnels are an integral part of routing these days, but 
require completely different tools.</P
><P
>With <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>iproute2</SPAN
>, tunnels are an integral part of 
the tool set.</P
><P
>The 2.2 and above Linux kernels include a completely redesigned network
subsystem. This new networking code brings Linux performance and a feature
set with little competition in the general OS arena. In fact, the new
routing, filtering, and classifying code is more featureful than the one
provided by many dedicated routers and firewalls and traffic shaping
products.</P
><P
>As new networking concepts have been invented, people have found ways to
plaster them on top of the existing framework in existing OSes. This
constant layering of cruft has lead to networking code that is filled with
strange behaviour, much like most human languages. In the past, Linux
emulated SunOS's handling of many of these things, which was not ideal.  </P
><P
>This new framework makes it possible to clearly express features
previously beyond Linux's reach.</P
