><P
>Classful qdiscs are very useful if you have different kinds of traffic which
should have differing treatment. One of the classful qdiscs is called 'CBQ'
, 'Class Based Queueing' and it is so widely mentioned that people identify
queueing with classes solely with CBQ, but this is not the case.</P
><P
>CBQ is merely the oldest kid on the block - and also the most complex one.
It may not always do what you want.  This may come as something of a shock
to many who fell for the 'sendmail effect', which teaches us that any
complex technology which doesn't come with documentation must be the best
available.</P

>9.5.1. Flow within classful qdiscs &#38; classes</H2
><P
>When traffic enters a classful qdisc, it needs to be sent to any of the
classes within - it needs to be 'classified'. To determine what to do with a
packet, the so called 'filters' are consulted. It is important to know that
the filters are called from within a qdisc, and not the other way around!</P
><P
>The filters attached to that qdisc then return with a decision, and the
qdisc uses this to enqueue the packet into one of the classes. Each subclass
may try other filters to see if further instructions apply. If not, the
class enqueues the packet to the qdisc it contains.</P
><P
>Besides containing other qdiscs, most classful qdiscs also perform shaping.
This is useful to perform both packet scheduling (with SFQ, for example) and
rate control. You need this in cases where you have a high speed
interface (for example, ethernet) to a slower device (a cable modem).</P
><P
>If you were only to run SFQ, nothing would happen, as packets enter &#38;
leave your router without delay: the output interface is far faster than
your actual link speed. There is no queue to schedule then.</P

>9.5.2. The qdisc family: roots, handles, siblings and parents</H2
><P
>Each interface has one egress 'root qdisc', by default the earlier mentioned
classless pfifo_fast queueing discipline. Each qdisc can be assigned a
handle, which can be used by later configuration statements to refer to that
qdisc. Besides an egress qdisc, an interface may also have an ingress, which
polices traffic coming in.</P
><P
>The handles of these qdiscs consist of two parts, a major number and a minor
number. It is habitual to name the root qdisc '1:', which is equal to '1:0'.
The minor number of a qdisc is always 0. </P
><P
>Classes need to have the same major number as their parent. </P

>But don't let this tree fool you! You should *not* imagine the kernel to be
at the apex of the tree and the network below, that is just not the case.
Packets get enqueued and dequeued at the root qdisc, which is the only thing
the kernel talks to. </P
><P
>A packet might get classified in a chain like this:</P
><P
>1: -&#62; 1:1 -&#62; 12: -&#62; 12:2</P
><P
>The packet now resides in a queue in a qdisc attached to class 12:2. In this
example, a filter was attached to each 'node' in the tree, each choosing a
branch to take next. This can make sense. However, this is also possible:</P
><P
>1: -&#62; 12:2</P
><P
>In this case, a filter attached to the root decided to send the packet
directly to 12:2.</P

NAME="AEN694"

>9.5.2.2. How packets are dequeued to the hardware</H3
><P
>When the kernel decides that it needs to extract packets to send to the
interface, the root qdisc 1: gets a dequeue request, which is passed to
1:1, which is in turn passed to 10:, 11: and 12:, which each query their
siblings, and try to dequeue() from them. In this case, the kernel needs to
walk the entire tree, because only 12:2 contains a packet. </P
><P
>In short, nested classes ONLY talk to their parent qdiscs, never to an
interface. Only the root qdisc gets dequeued by the kernel!</P
><P
>The upshot of this is that classes never get dequeued faster than their
parents allow. And this is exactly what we want: this way we can have SFQ in
an inner class, which doesn't do any shaping, only scheduling, and have a
shaping outer qdisc, which does the shaping.</P

>9.5.3. The PRIO qdisc</H2
><P
>The PRIO qdisc doesn't actually shape, it only subdivides traffic based on
how you configured your filters. You can consider the PRIO qdisc a kind
of pfifo_fast on steroids, whereby each band is a separate class instead of
a simple FIFO.</P
><P
>When a packet is enqueued to the PRIO qdisc, a class is chosen based on the
filter commands you gave. By default, three classes are created. These
classes by default contain pure FIFO qdiscs with no internal
structure, but you can replace these by any qdisc you have available.</P
><P
>Whenever a packet needs to be dequeued, class :1 is tried first. Higher
classes are only used if lower bands all did not give up a packet.</P
><P
>This qdisc is very useful in case you want to prioritize certain kinds of
traffic without using only TOS-flags but using all the power of the tc
filters. It can also contain more all qdiscs, whereas pfifo_fast is limited
to simple fifo qdiscs.</P
><P
>Because it doesn't actually shape, the same warning as for SFQ holds: either
use it only if your physical link is really full or wrap it inside a
classful qdisc that does shape. The last holds for almost all cable modems
and DSL devices.</P

The bands are classes, and are called major:1 to major:3 by default, so if
your PRIO qdisc is called 12:, tc filter traffic to 12:1 to grant it more

>9.5.4. The famous CBQ qdisc</H2
><P
>As said before, CBQ is the most complex qdisc available, the most hyped, the
least understood, and probably the trickiest one to get right. This is not
because the authors are evil or incompetent, far from it, it's just that the
CBQ algorithm isn't all that precise and doesn't really match the way Linux
works.</P
><P
>Besides being classful, CBQ is also a shaper and it is in that aspect that
it really doesn't work very well. It should work like this. If you try to
shape a 10mbit/s connection to 1mbit/s, the link should be idle 90% of the
time. If it isn't, we need to throttle so that it IS idle 90% of the time.</P
><P
>This is pretty hard to measure, so CBQ  instead derives the idle time from
the number of microseconds that elapse between requests from the hardware
layer for more data. Combined, this can be used to approximate how full or
empty the link is.</P
><P
>This is rather circumspect and doesn't always arrive at proper results. For
example, what if the actual link speed of an interface that is not really
able to transmit the full 100mbit/s of data, perhaps because of a badly
implemented driver? A PCMCIA network card will also never achieve 100mbit/s
because of the way the bus is designed - again, how do we calculate the idle
time?</P
><P
>It gets even worse if we consider not-quite-real network devices like PPP
over Ethernet or PPTP over TCP/IP. The effective bandwidth in that case is
probably determined by the efficiency of pipes to userspace - which is huge.</P
><P
>People who have done measurements discover that CBQ is not always very
accurate and sometimes completely misses the mark.</P
><P
>In many circumstances however it works well. With the documentation provided
here, you should be able to configure it to work well in most cases.</P

>9.5.4.1. CBQ shaping in detail</H3
><P
>As said before, CBQ works by making sure that the link is idle just long
enough to bring down the real bandwidth to the configured rate. To do so, it
calculates the time that should pass between average packets. </P
><P
>During operations, the effective idletime is measured using an exponential
weighted moving average (EWMA), which considers recent packets to be
exponentially more important than past ones. The UNIX loadaverage is
calculated in the same way.</P
><P
>The calculated idle time is subtracted from the EWMA measured one, the
resulting number is called 'avgidle'. A perfectly loaded link has an avgidle
of zero: packets arrive exactly once every calculated interval.  </P
><P
>An overloaded link has a negative avgidle and if it gets too negative, CBQ
shuts down for a while and is then 'overlimit'.</P
><P
>Conversely, an idle link might amass a huge avgidle, which would then allow
infinite bandwidths after a few hours of silence. To prevent this, avgidle is
capped at maxidle.</P
><P
>If overlimit, in theory, the CBQ could throttle itself for exactly the
amount of time that was calculated to pass between packets, and then pass
one packet, and throttle again. But see the 'minburst' parameter below.</P

><P
>This number of packets is used to calculate maxidle so that when avgidle is
at maxidle, this number of average packets can be burst before avgidle drops
to 0. Set it higher to be more tolerant of bursts. You can't set maxidle
directly, only via this parameter.</P
></DD
><DT
>minburst</DT
><DD
><P
>As mentioned before, CBQ needs to throttle in case of overlimit. The ideal
solution is to do so for exactly the calculated idle time, and pass 1
packet. However, Unix kernels generally have a hard time scheduling events
shorter than 10ms, so it is better to throttle for a longer period, and then
pass minburst packets in one go, and then sleep minburst times longer.</P
><P
>The time to wait is called the offtime. Higher values of minburst lead to
more accurate shaping in the long term, but to bigger bursts at millisecond
timescales.</P
></DD
><DT
>minidle</DT
><DD
><P
>If avgidle is below 0, we are overlimits and need to wait until avgidle will
be big enough to send one packet. To prevent a sudden burst from shutting
down the link for a prolonged period of time, avgidle is reset to minidle if
it gets too low.</P

acts like the PRIO queue in the sense that classes can have differing
priorities and that lower priority numbers will be polled before the higher

network, a weighted round robin process ('WRR') starts, beginning with the
lower priority classes.</P

arbitrary numbers: only the ratios are important. People have been

>9.5.4.5. Other CBQ parameters: split &#38; defmap</H3
><P
>As said before, a classful qdisc needs to call filters to determine
which class a packet will be enqueued to. </P
><P
>Besides calling the filter, CBQ offers other options, defmap &#38; split.
This is pretty complicated to understand, and it is not vital. But as this
is the only known place where defmap &#38; split are properly explained, I'm
doing my best. </P
><P
>As you will often want to filter on the Type of Service field only, a special
syntax is provided. Whenever the CBQ needs to figure out where a packet
needs to be enqueued, it checks if this node is a 'split node'. If so, one
of the sub-qdiscs has indicated that it wishes to receive all packets with
a certain configured priority, as might be derived from the TOS field, or
socket options set by applications.</P
><P
>The packets' priority bits are or-ed with the defmap field to see if a match
exists. In other words, this is a short-hand way of creating a very fast
filter, which only matches certain priorities. A defmap of ff (hex) will
match everything, a map of 0 nothing. A sample configuration may help make
things clearer:</P

>9.5.5. Hierarchical Token Bucket</H2
><P
>Martin Devera (&#60;devik&#62;) rightly realised that CBQ is complex and does
not seem optimized for many typical situations. His Hierarchical approach is
well suited for setups where you have a fixed amount of bandwidth which you
want to divide for different purposes, giving each purpose a guaranteed
bandwidth, with the possibility of specifying how much bandwidth can be
borrowed.</P
><P
>HTB works just like CBQ but does not resort to idle time calculations to
shape. Instead, it is a classful Token Bucket Filter - hence the name. It
has only a few parameters, which are well documented on his

>As your HTB configuration gets more complex, your configuration scales
well. With CBQ it is already complex even in simple cases! HTB is not yet a
part of the standard kernel, but it should soon be!</P
