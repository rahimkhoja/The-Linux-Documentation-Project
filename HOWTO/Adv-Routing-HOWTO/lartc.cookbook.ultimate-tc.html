>15.8. The Ultimate Traffic Conditioner: Low Latency, Fast Up &#38; Downloads</H1
><P
>Note: This script has recently been upgraded and previously only worked for
Linux clients in your network! So you might want to update if you have
Windows machines or Macs in your network and noticed that they were not able
to download faster while others were uploading.</P
><P
>I attempted to create the holy grail:
<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Maintain low latency for interactive traffic at all times</DT
><DD
><P
>This means that downloading or uploading files should not disturb SSH or
even telnet. These are the most important things, even 200ms latency is
sluggish to work over.</P
></DD
><DT
>Allow 'surfing' at reasonable speeds while up or downloading</DT
><DD
><P
>Even though http is 'bulk' traffic, other traffic should not drown it out 
too much.</P
></DD
><DT
>Make sure uploads don't harm downloads, and the other way around</DT
><DD
><P
>This is a much observed phenomenon where upstream traffic simply destroys
download speed.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
>
It turns out that all this is possible, at the cost of a tiny bit of
bandwidth. The reason that uploads, downloads and ssh hurt each other is the
presence of large queues in many domestic access devices like cable or DSL
modems.</P
><P
>The next section explains in depth what causes the delays, and how we can
fix them. You can safely skip it and head straight for the script if you
don't care how the magic is performed.</P

>15.8.1. Why it doesn't work well by default</H2
><P
>ISPs know that they are benchmarked solely on how fast people can download.
Besides available bandwidth, download speed is influenced heavily by packet
loss, which seriously hampers TCP/IP performance. Large queues can help
prevent packet loss, and speed up downloads. So ISPs configure large queues.</P
><P
>These large queues however damage interactivity. A keystroke must first
travel the upstream queue, which may be seconds (!) long and go to your
remote host. It is then displayed, which leads to a packet coming back, which
must then traverse the downstream queue, located at your ISP, before it
appears on your screen.</P
><P
>This HOWTO teaches you how to mangle and process the queue in many ways, but
sadly, not all queues are accessible to us. The queue over at the ISP is
completely off-limits, whereas the upstream queue probably lives inside your
cable modem or DSL device. You may or may not be able to configure it. Most
probably not.</P
><P
>So, what next? As we can't control either of those queues, they must be
eliminated, and moved to your Linux router. Luckily this is possible.</P
><P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Limit upload speed</DT
><DD
><P
>By limiting our upload speed to slightly less than the truly available rate,
no queues are built up in our modem. The queue is now moved to Linux.</P
></DD
><DT
>Limit download speed</DT
><DD
><P
>This is slightly trickier as we can't really influence how fast the internet
ships us data. We can however drop packets that are coming in too fast,
which causes TCP/IP to slow down to just the rate we want. Because we don't 
want to drop traffic unnecessarily, we configure a 'burst' size we allow at
higher speed.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
></P
><P
>Now, once we have done this, we have eliminated the downstream queue totally
(except for short bursts), and gain the ability to manage the upstream queue
with all the power Linux offers.</P
><P
>What remains to be done is to make sure interactive traffic jumps to the
front of the upstream queue. To make sure that uploads don't hurt downloads,
we also move ACK packets to the front of the queue. This is what normally
causes the huge slowdown observed when generating bulk traffic both ways.
The ACKnowledgements for downstream traffic must compete with upstream
traffic, and get delayed in the process.</P
><P
>If we do all this we get the following measurements using an excellent ADSL
connection from xs4all in the Netherlands:</P

>Baseline latency:
round-trip min/avg/max = 14.4/17.1/21.7 ms

Without traffic conditioner, while downloading:
round-trip min/avg/max = 560.9/573.6/586.4 ms

Without traffic conditioner, while uploading:
round-trip min/avg/max = 2041.4/2332.1/2427.6 ms

With conditioner, during 220kbit/s upload:
round-trip min/avg/max = 15.7/51.8/79.9 ms

With conditioner, during 850kbit/s download:
round-trip min/avg/max = 20.4/46.9/74.0 ms

When uploading, downloads proceed at ~80% of the available speed. Uploads
at around 90%. Latency then jumps to 850 ms, still figuring out why.</PRE

></TABLE
>&#13;</P
><P
>What you can expect from this script depends a lot on your actual uplink
speed. When uploading at full speed, there will always be a single packet
ahead of your keystroke. That is the lower limit to the latency you can
achieve - divide your MTU by your upstream speed to calculate. Typical
values will be somewhat higher than that. Lower your MTU for better effects!</P
><P
>Next, two versions of this script, one with Devik's excellent HTB, the other
with CBQ which is in each Linux kernel, unlike HTB. Both are tested and work
well.</P

qdisc we place two Stochastic Fairness Queues that make sure that multiple
bulk streams don't drown each other out.</P
><P
>Downstream traffic is policed using a tc filter containing a Token Bucket
Filter.</P
><P
>You might improve on this script by adding 'bounded' to the line that starts
with 'tc class add .. classid 1:20'. If you lowered your MTU, also lower the
allot &#38; avpkt numbers!</P
