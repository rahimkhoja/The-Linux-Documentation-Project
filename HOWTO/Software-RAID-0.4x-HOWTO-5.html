What is the current best known-stable patch for RAID in the 
2.0.x series kernels?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
As of 18 Sept 1997, it is 
"2.0.30 + pre-9 2.0.31 + Werner Fink's swapping patch 
+ the alpha RAID patch".  As of November 1997, it is
2.0.31 + ... !?

The RAID patches will not install cleanly for me.  What's wrong? 
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Make sure that <CODE>/usr/include/linux</CODE> is a symbolic link to
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/include/linux</CODE>.

Make sure that the new files <CODE>raid5.c</CODE>, etc.
have been copied to their correct locations.  Sometimes
the patch command will not create new files.  Try the 
<CODE>-f</CODE> flag on <CODE>patch</CODE>.

While compiling raidtools 0.42, compilation stops trying to 
include &lt;pthread.h&gt; but it doesn't exist in my system. 
How do I fix this?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
raidtools-0.42 requires linuxthreads-0.6 from:

Alternately, use glibc v2.0.

Use <CODE>mkraid</CODE> to initialize the RAID set prior to the first use.
<CODE>mkraid</CODE> ensures that the RAID array is initially in a 
consistent state by erasing the RAID partitions. In addition, 
<CODE>mkraid</CODE> will create the RAID superblocks.

Try <CODE>lsmod</CODE> (or, alternately, <CODE>cat
/proc/modules</CODE>) to see if the raid modules are loaded.
If they are not, you can load them explicitly with
the <CODE>modprobe raid1</CODE> or <CODE>modprobe raid5</CODE>
command.  Alternately,  if you are using the autoloader,
and expected <CODE>kerneld</CODE> to load them and it didn't
this is probably because your loader is missing the info to
load the modules.  Edit <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE> and add 
the following lines:

<PRE>
    alias md-personality-3 raid1
    alias md-personality-4 raid5

The raid-tools package will create these devices when 
you run <CODE>make install</CODE> as root.  Alternately,
you can do the following:
<PRE>
    cd /dev 
    ./MAKEDEV md

I try to mount it and get the following error:
<CODE> mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/md0,
or too many mounted file systems</CODE>. What's wrong?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
You need to create a file system on <CODE>/dev/md0</CODE>
before you can mount it.  Use <CODE>mke2fs</CODE>.

On my Linux 2.0.30 system, while doing a <CODE>mkraid</CODE> for a 
RAID-1 device,
during the clearing of the two individual partitions, I got
<CODE>"Cannot allocate free page"</CODE> errors appearing on the console,
and <CODE>"Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ..."</CODE>
errors in the system log.  At this time, the system became quite 
unusable, but it appears to recover after a while.  The operation 
appears to have completed with no other errors, and I am 
successfully using my RAID-1 device.  The errors are disconcerting 
though.  Any ideas?

This was a well-known bug in the 2.0.30 kernels.  It is fixed in 
the 2.0.31 kernel; alternately, fall back to 2.0.29.

Make sure that you've run the <CODE>mkraid</CODE> part of the install

When I access <CODE>/dev/md0</CODE>, the kernel spits out a

<BLOCKQUOTE>

To be usable, the device must be running. Use 
<CODE>mdrun -px /dev/md0</CODE> where x is l for linear, 0 for 
RAID-0 or 1 for RAID-1, etc.

I've created a linear md-dev with 2 devices. 
<CODE>cat /proc/mdstat</CODE> shows

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
You must <CODE>mkfs</CODE> your new md-dev before using it 
the first time, so that the filesystem will cover the whole device.

I've set up <CODE>/etc/mdtab</CODE> using mdcreate, I've
<CODE>mdadd</CODE>'ed, <CODE>mdrun</CODE> and <CODE>fsck</CODE>'ed 
my two <CODE>/dev/mdX</CODE> partitions.  Everything looks
okay before a reboot.  As soon as I reboot, I get an 
<CODE>fsck</CODE> error on both partitions: <CODE>fsck.ext2: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short
read while trying too open /dev/md0</CODE>.  Why?! How do 
I fix it?!  

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
During the boot process, the RAID partitions must be started
before they can be <CODE>fsck</CODE>'ed.  This must be done
in one of the boot scripts.  For some distributions,
<CODE>fsck</CODE> is called from <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.S</CODE>, for others,
it is called from <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</CODE>. Change this
file to <CODE>mdadd -ar</CODE> *before* <CODE>fsck -A</CODE>
is executed.  Better yet, it is suggested that 
<CODE>ckraid</CODE> be run if <CODE>mdadd</CODE> returns with an 
error.  How do do this is discussed in greater detail in
question 14 of the section ''Error Recovery''.

a partition which is larger than 2GB.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
This seems to be a problem with <CODE>mke2fs</CODE>
(November 97).  A temporary work-around is to get the mke2fs
code, and add <CODE>#undef HAVE_LLSEEK</CODE> to 
<CODE>e2fsprogs-1.10/lib/ext2fs/llseek.c</CODE> just before the 
first <CODE>#ifdef HAVE_LLSEEK</CODE> and recompile mke2fs.

The RAID0/linear configuration file format used in

The personality modules (<CODE>raid1.o</CODE>) are not loaded automatically; 
they have to be manually modprobe'd before mdrun. How can this
be fixed?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
To autoload the modules, we can add the following to 
<CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE>:
<PRE>
    alias md-personality-3 raid1
    alias md-personality-4 raid5

The default configuration for software RAID is 8 real

I can't make <CODE>md</CODE> work with partitions on our 
latest SPARCstation 5.  I suspect that this has something
to do with disk-labels.
      
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Sun disk-labels sit in the first 1K of a partition.
For RAID-1, the Sun disk-label is not an issue since 
<CODE>ext2fs</CODE> will skip the label on every mirror.
For other raid levels (0, linear and 4/5), this 
appears to be a problem; it has not yet (Dec 97) been 
addressed.
