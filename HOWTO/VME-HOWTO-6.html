<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Current and planned Board Support</A></H2>

<P>While the VMELinux driver should work with any PCI based design, the following boards have actually run our software.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Xycom XVME655 Pentium VMEbus Board</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> This XyCom board is compatible with the standard VMELinux kernel driver package from 
<A HREF="http://www.vmelinux.org/">VMELinux Project</A></LI>
<LI> A prepared kernel will be available soon.  It will be based on the newest version of the Linux kernel and will include appropriate drivers for the on board NE2100 Ethernet interface.  Check the website for details.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 XyCom XVME656 Pentium VMEBus Board</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> This XyCom board is compatible with the standard VMELinux kernel driver package from 
<A HREF="http://www.vmelinux.org/">VMELinux Project</A></LI>
<LI> A prepared kernel will be available soon.  It will be based on the newest version of the Linux kernel and will include appropriate drivers for the on board AHA2940/AIC7000 SCSI and 82558 Intel EtherExpress Ethernet peripherals.  Check the website for details.</LI>
