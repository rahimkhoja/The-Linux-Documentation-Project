<P>
<P>Portions of this text come from comments in the kernel source
files (obviously).  I have added annotations in many places.
I hope that this will be useful to kernel developers -- either
new ones or experienced ones who need more of this type of
information.  However, if there's not enough detail here for
you, "Use the Source."
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This description is organized as a brief overview which
lists the sections that are described later in more detail.
<P>The description is in three main sections.  The first section covers
early kernel initialization on IA-32 (but only after your boot loader of
choice and other intermediate loaders have run; i.e., this description
does not cover loading the kernel).
This section is based on the code in "linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S"
and "linux/arch/i386/boot/video.S".
<P>The second major section covers Linux initialization that is
x86- (or i386- or IA-32-) specific.  This section is based on the source
files "linux/arch/i386/kernel/head.S" and "linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c".
<P>The third major section covers Linux initialization that is
architecture-independent.  This section is based on the flow in the
source file "linux/init/main.c".
<P>See the References section for other valuable documents
about booting, loading, and initialization.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 This document</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This document describes Linux 2.4.x initialization on IA-32
(or i386 or x86) processors -- after one or more kernel boot loaders
(if any) have done their job.
<P>You can format it using the commands (for example):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% sgml2txt ia32_init_240.sgml
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% sgml2html ia32_init_240.sgml
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will produce plain ASCII or HTML files respectively.
You can also produce LaTeX, GNU, and RTF info by using the proper
sgmltool (man sgmltools).
