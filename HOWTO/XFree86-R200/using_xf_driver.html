>4.1. Alternative 1: Using XFree86's Radeon driver</H1
><P
>This alternative requires XFree 4.2 or later, and the installation or upgrade to this version is beyond the scope of this HOWTO (visit <A
HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>The XFree86 Project</A
> for further information on how to upgrade or install XFree86). When XFree is installed and/or upgraded to the correct version, all you need to do is configure it. There are two ways of doing this that apply to all Linux distributions. You can either run <B
CLASS="command"
>xf86onfig</B
>, which is XFree86's own text-based configuration tool, or you can edit the configuration file by hand. Keep in mind that this HOWTO only describes how to configure the Radeon card, and XFree86 needs a lot more configuration than that to work.</P
><P
>If you choose to run <B
CLASS="command"
>xf86config</B
>, you will sooner or later come to the question, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Do you want to look at the card database? (y/n)"</SPAN
>. Answer <TT
CLASS="userinput"
><B
>y</B
></TT
> (yes), and press <TT
CLASS="userinput"
><B
>ENTER</B
></TT
>.  Choose one of the cards that use the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ati</TT
> driver by keying in the number to its left and then pressing <TT
CLASS="userinput"
><B
>ENTER</B
></TT
>. Which card you choose does not matter, as long as you choose a card that runs the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ati</TT
> driver. You will then be asked to give an identifier string for your card. You can type anything you want, but I recommend you type something descriptive, such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Radeon card"</SPAN
>. Finish the configuration process.</P
><P
>If you want to edit the configuration file manually, locate it (usually <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/X11/XF86Config</TT
>), and open it in your favorite editor. Find the place that  says <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Section "Device"</TT
>. In this section, there should be a line saying <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Driver "somedrivername"</TT
>. Edit this line so it says <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Driver "ati"</TT
>. Comment out all other lines in the Device section (add a # in front of them). Your device section should now look like this:
