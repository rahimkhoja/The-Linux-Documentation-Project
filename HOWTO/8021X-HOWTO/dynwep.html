>&#13;  As described in <A
HREF="intro.html#Key"
>Key Management</A
>, one of
  the big advantages of using Dynamic WEP/802.11i with 802.1X is the
  support for session keys. A new encryption key is generated for each
  session.
  </P
><P
>&#13;  <SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Dynamic
  WEP"</SPAN
> as of this writing. Support for WPA and RSN/WPA2
  (802.11i) is being worked on, and is estimated to be supported at
  the end of the year/early next year (2004/2005), according to Chris
  Hessing (one of the <SPAN

>
  developers).
  </P
><P
>&#13;  Not all wireless drives support dynamic WEP, nor WPA. To use RSN
  (WPA2), new support in hardware may even be required. Many older
  drivers assume only one WEP key will be used on the network at any
  time. The card is reset whenever the key is changed to let the new
  key take effect. This triggers a new authentication, and there is a
  never-ending loop.
  </P
><P
>&#13;  At the time of writing, most of the wireless drivers in the base
  Linux kernel require patching to make dynamic WEP/WPA work. They
  will, in time, be upgraded to support these new features. Many drivers
  developed outside the kernel, however, support for dynamic WEP;
  HostAP, madwifi, Orinoco, and atmel should work without problems.

>&#13;  Instead of using Xsupplicant, <A

  may be used. It has support for both WPA and RSN (WPA2), and a wide
  range of EAP authentication methods.
