>2. Overview of the Market</H1
><P
>The central fact about PC hardware is that de-facto hardware
standards have created a commodity market with low entry barriers, lots of
competitive pressure, and volume high enough to amortize a
<EM
>lot</EM
> of development on the cheap.</P
><P
>The result is that this hardware gives you lots of
bang-per-buck, and it's getting both cheaper and better all the time.
Furthermore, margins are thin enough that vendors have to be lean,
hungry, and <EM
>very</EM
> responsive to the market to
survive.</P
><P
>One good general piece of advice is that you should avoid 
the highest-end new-technology systems (those not yet shipping in
volume). The problem with the high end is that it usually
carries a hefty <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"prestige"</SPAN
> price premium, and may be a bit less
reliable on average because the technology hasn't been through a lot
of test/improve cycles.</P
><P
>There used to be a real issue with low-end PCs as well,
because there used to be a lot of dodgy crap PC components out
there going into boxes made by vendors trying to save a few cents.
That's not really a problem anymore.  Market pressure has been 
very effective at raising reliability standards for even low-end 
components as the market has matured.  It's actually hard to go
wrong even buying at the bottom end of the market these days.</P
><P
>I put together the first version of this guide around 1992;
Unix-capable systems are now ten to twenty times cheaper than they were
then.  At today's prices, building your own system from parts no
longer makes much sense at all &#8212;so this HOWTO is now more oriented
towards helping you configure a whole system from a single vendor.</P
