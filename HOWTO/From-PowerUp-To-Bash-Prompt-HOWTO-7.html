<H2><A NAME="s7">7. The Filesystem</A></H2>

<P>In this section, I will be using the word ``filesystem'' in two different ways.
There are filesystems on disk partitions and other devices, 
and there is the filesystem as it is
presented to you by a running Linux system. In Linux, you ``mount'' a disk
filesystem onto the system's filesystem.
<P>
<P>In the previous section I mentioned that init scripts check and mount the
filesystems. The commands that do this are <CODE>fsck</CODE> and <CODE>mount</CODE>
respectively.
<P>
<P>A hard disk is just a big space that you can write ones and zeros on. A
filesystem imposes some structure on this, and makes it look like files within
directories within directories... Each file is represented by an inode, which
says who's file it is, when it was created and where to find its contents.
Directories are also represented by inodes, but these say where to find the
inodes of the files that are in the directory. If the system wants to read
<CODE>/home/greg/bigboobs.jpeg</CODE>, it first finds the inode for the root
directory <CODE>/</CODE> in the ``superblock'', then finds the inode for the
directory <CODE>home</CODE> in the contents of <CODE>/</CODE>, then finds the inode for
the directory <CODE>greg</CODE> in the contents of <CODE>/home</CODE>, 
then the inode for <CODE>bigboobs.jpeg</CODE> which
will tell it which disk blocks to read.
<P>
<P>
<P>If we add some data to the end of a file, it could happen that the data is
written before the inode is updated to say that the new blocks belong to the
file, or vice versa. If the power cuts out at this point, the filesystem will
be broken. It is this kind of thing that <CODE>fsck</CODE> attempts to detect and
repair.
<P>
<P>The mount command takes a filesystem on a device, and adds it to the heirarchy
that you see when you use your system. Usually, the kernel mounts its root file
system read-only. The mount command is used to remount it read-write after
<CODE>fsck</CODE> has checked that it is ok.
<P>
<P>Linux supports other kinds of filesystem too: msdos, vfat, minix and so on. The
details of the specific kind of filesystem are abstracted away by the virtual
file system (VFS). I won't go into any detail on this though. There is a
discussion of it in ``The Linux Kernel'' 
(see section 
<A HREF="From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO-4.html#Kernel">The Linux Kernel</A> for a url)
<P>
<P>A completely different kind of filesystem gets mounted on <CODE>/proc</CODE>.
It is really a representation of things in the kernel. There is a 
directory there for each process running on the system, with the process
number as the directory name. There are also files such as <CODE>interrupts</CODE>,
and <CODE>meminfo</CODE> which tell you about how the hardware is being used.
You can learn a lot by exploring <CODE>/proc</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>There are parameters to the command <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> which creates ext2
filesystems. These control the size of blocks, the number of inodes and so on.
Check the <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> man page for details.
<P>
<P>What gets mounted where on your filesystem is controlled by the <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE>
file. It also has a man page. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Exercises</A>
</H2>

<P>Make a very small filesystem, and view it with a hex viewer. Identify inodes,
superblocks and file contents.
<P>
<P>I believe there are tools that give you a graphical view of a filesystem.
Find one, try it out, and email me the url and a review!
<P>
<P>Check out the ext2 filesystem code in the Kernel.

<LI>Chapter 9 of the LDP book ``The Linux Kernel'' is an excellent description
of filesystems. You can find it at the Australian LDP
<A HREF="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/linux/LDP/LDP/">mirror</A></LI>
<LI>The <CODE>mount</CODE> command is part of the util-linux package, there is a link 
to it in 
<A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/~gok/power2bash">Building a Minimal Linux System from Source Code</A> </LI>
<LI>man pages for <CODE>mount</CODE>, <CODE>fstab</CODE>, <CODE>fsck</CODE>, <CODE>mke2fs</CODE>
and <CODE>proc</CODE></LI>
<LI>The file <CODE>Documentation/proc.txt</CODE> in the Linux source code explains
the <CODE>/proc</CODE> filesystem.</LI>

Another 
<A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">link</A> to the Unix File System Standard.
This describes what should go where
in a Unix file system, and why. It also has minimum requirements for
the contents of <CODE>/bin</CODE>, <CODE>/sbin</CODE> and so on. This is a 
good reference if your goal is to make a minimal yet complete system.</LI>
