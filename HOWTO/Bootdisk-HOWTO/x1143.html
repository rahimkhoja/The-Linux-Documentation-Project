from <A
HREF="http://www.linuxrouter.org/floppy.shtml"
TARGET="_top"
> information
provided by Dave Cinege</A
> from the Linux Router Project.</P
><P
>&#13;The LS-120 is an IDE floppy drive.  It is compatible with both standard 3.5"
disks and the new 120MB disks.  As of Linux v2.0.31 there is full support.  To
be able to boot from these you must have a BIOS that specifically allows the
LS-120 to be treated as drive 0 (whereas IDE devices normally start at 80).
If you do not have BIOS support, you can purchase a small IDE FloppyMAX card
from Promise Technologies to overcome this deficiency.</P
><P
>&#13;The kernel boot loader does not like the LS-120, and instantly dies.  Also 2m
disks do not like it and will not boot.  1.44MB through 1.74MB disks will work
fine.  SYSLINUX works with the 120MB disks as of v1.32.  You would better off
partitioning the disk and using ext2 or minix, instead of SYSLINUX unless you
need MS-DOS compatibility.</P
><P
>LILO does work fine with 120MB disks. Here is a sample lilo.conf:

The line "disk=/dev/hda bios=0" is what does the trick to make it boot the

CLASS="ANSWER"

><B
>A: </B
>The easiest way is to obtain a Slackware kernel from your nearest Slackware
mirror site. Slackware kernels are generic kernels which atttempt to
include drivers for as many devices as possible, so if you have a SCSI or
IDE controller, chances are that a driver for it is included in the
Slackware kernel.</P
><P
>Go to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>a1</TT
> directory and select either IDE or SCSI
kernel depending on the type of controller you have. Check the xxxxkern.cfg
file for the selected kernel to see the drivers which have been included in
that kernel. If the device you want is in that list, then the corresponding
kernel should boot your computer. Download the xxxxkern.tgz file and copy
it to your boot diskette as described above in the section on making boot
disks.</P
><P
> You must then check the root device in the kernel, using the command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rdev zImage</B
>.  If this is not the same as the root device
you want, use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rdev</B
> to change it.  For example, the kernel I
tried was set to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda2</TT
>, but my root SCSI partition is
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda8</TT
>.  To use a root diskette, you would have to use
the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rdev zImage /dev/fd0</B
>.</P
><P
>If you want to know how to set up a Slackware root disk as well, that's
outside the scope of this HOWTO, so I suggest you check the Linux Install
Guide or get the Slackware distribution.  See the section in this HOWTO titled
``References''.</P

The easiest way is to copy the filesystem from the rootdisk back to the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>DEVICE</SPAN
> you used (from <A
HREF="buildroot.html#CREATINGROOTFS"
>Section 4.2</A
>, above).
Then mount the filesystem and make the changes.  You have to remember where
your root filesystem started and how many blocks it occupied:

>DEVICE</SPAN
>
        mount -t ext2 <SPAN
CLASS="SYMBOL"
>DEVICE</SPAN
> /mnt</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
After making the changes, proceed as before (in <A
HREF="buildroot.html#WRAPPINGITUP"
>Section 4.7</A
>) and transfer the root filesystem back to the disk.
You should not have to re-transfer the kernel or re-compute the ramdisk word
if you do not change the starting position of the new root filesystem.</P

MBR stands for Master Boot Record.  This command replaces the boot sector
with a clean DOS one, without affecting the partition table.  Some purists
disagree with this, but even the author of LILO, Werner Almesberger,
suggests it.  It is easy, and it works.</P

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
>A: </B
>If you don't have a boot disk standing by, probably the easiest method is
to obtain a Slackware kernel for your disk controller type (IDE or SCSI) as
described above for ``How do I make a boot disk with a XXX driver?''.  You
can then boot your computer using this kernel, then repair whatever damage
there is.</P
><P
> The kernel you get may not have the root device set to the disk type
and partition you want. For example, Slackware's generic SCSI kernel has
the root device set to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda2</TT
>, whereas my root
Linux partition happens to be <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda8</TT
>.  In this case
the root device in the kernel will have to be changed.</P
><P
>You can still change the root device and ramdisk settings in the kernel
even if all you have is a kernel, and some other operating system,
such as DOS.</P
><P
> <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rdev</B
> changes kernel settings by changing the
values at fixed offsets in the kernel file, so you can do the same if you
have a hex editor available on whatever systems you do still have running
-- for example, Norton Utilities Disk Editor under DOS.  You then need to
check and if necessary change the values in the kernel at the following
offsets:

Once you have set these values then you can write the file to a diskette
using either Norton Utilities Disk Editor, or a program called
<B

>rawrite.exe</B
>.  This program is included in all
distributions.  It is a DOS program which writes a file to the ``raw''
disk, starting at the boot sector, instead of writing it to the file
system.  If you use Norton Utilities you must write the file to a physical
disk starting at the beginning of the disk.</P

Where a disk device cannot be autodetected it is necessary to supply the
kernel with a command device parameter string, such as:
<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>        aha152x=0x340,11,3,1</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

This parameter string can be supplied in several ways using LILO:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>By entering it on the command line every time the system is booted via
LILO.  This is boring, though.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>By using LILO's <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>lock</TT
> keyword to make it store the
command line as the default command line, so that LILO will use the same
options every time it boots.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>By using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>append=</TT
> statement in the LILO config file.
Note that the parameter string must be enclosed in quotes.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
> For example, a sample command line using the above parameter string
would be:
<TABLE

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
> This would pass the device parameter string through, and also ask
the kernel to set the root device to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda1</TT
> and
save the whole command line and reuse it for all future boots.</P
><P
>A sample APPEND statement is:
<TABLE

><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
> Note that the parameter string must <EM
>not</EM
> be
enclosed in quotes on the command line, but it <EM
>must</EM
> be
enclosed in quotes in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>APPEND</TT
> statement.</P
><P
> Note also that for the parameter string to be acted on, the kernel
must contain the driver for that disk type.  If it does not, then there is
nothing listening for the parameter string, and you will have to rebuild
the kernel to include the required driver.  For details on rebuilding the
kernel, go to  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux</TT
> and read the README, and
read the Linux FAQ and Installation HOWTO.  Alternatively you could obtain
a generic kernel for the disk type and install that.</P
><P
>Readers are strongly urged to read the LILO documentation before
experimenting with LILO installation.  Incautious use of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BOOT</TT
> statement can damage partitions.</P

There are several cases of program names being hardcoded in various utilities.
These cases do not occur everywhere, but they may explain why an executable
apparently cannot be found on your system even though you can see that it is
there.  You can find out if a given program has the name of another hardcoded
by using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>strings</B
> command and piping the output
through <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>grep</B
>.</P
><P
>Known examples of hardcoding are:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>shutdown</B
> in some versions has
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/reboot</TT
> hardcoded, so <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>reboot</B
>
must be placed in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
> directory.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>init</B
> has caused problems for at least one person, with the
kernel being unable to find <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>init</B
>.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
> To fix these problems, either move the programs to the correct
directory, or change configuration files
(e.g. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>inittab</TT
>) to point to the correct directory.  If
in doubt, put programs in the same directories as they are on your hard
disk, and use the same <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>inittab</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/rc.d</TT
> files as they appear on your hard disk.</P

behaviour can be unpredictable, and can result in kernel panics.</P
