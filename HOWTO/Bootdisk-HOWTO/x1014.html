HREF="buildroot.html"
>Section 4</A
> gave instructions for building a compressed root
filesystem which is loaded to ramdisk when the system boots.  This method
has many advantages so it is commonly used.  However, some systems with
little memory cannot afford the RAM needed for this, and they must use root
filesystems mounted directly from the diskette.</P
><P
>Such filesystems are actually easier to build than compressed root filesystems
because they can be built on a diskette rather than on some other device, and
they do not have to be compressed.  We will outline the procedure as it
differs from the instructions above.  If you choose to do this, keep in mind
that you will have <EM
>much less space</EM
> available.</P

If you are building a single boot/root disk, you must fit all blocks for the

><P
> There are several shortcuts you can take.  If you are building a
two-disk set, you can build the complete root filesystem directly on the
second disk and you need not transfer it to a hard disk file and then back.
Also, if you are building a single boot/root disk and using LILO, you can
build a <EM
>single</EM
> filesystem on the entire disk,
containing the kernel, LILO files and root files, and simply run LILO as
the last step.</P

>Building a utility disk is relatively easy -- simply create a filesystem
on a formatted disk and copy files to it.  To use it with a bootdisk,
mount it manually after the system is booted.</P
><P
>In the instructions above, we mentioned that the utility disk could be
mounted as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
>.  In this case, binaries could be placed into a
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin</TT
> directory on your utility disk, so that placing
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/bin</TT
> in your path will access them.  Additional libraries
needed by the binaries are placed in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib</TT

disk:</P
