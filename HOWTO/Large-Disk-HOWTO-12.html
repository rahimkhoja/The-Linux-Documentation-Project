<H2><A NAME="s12">12. The Linux 65535 cylinder limit</A></H2>

<P>The <CODE>HDIO_GETGEO</CODE> ioctl returns the number of cylinders in a short.
This means that if you have more than 65535 cylinders, the number is
truncated, and (for a typical SCSI setup with 1 MiB cylinders)
a 80 GiB disk may appear as a 16 GiB one.
Once one recognizes what the problem is, it is easily avoided.
Use fdisk 2.10i or newer.
<P>(The programming convention is to use the <CODE>BLKGETSIZE</CODE> ioctl
to get total size, and <CODE>HDIO_GETGEO</CODE> to get number of heads and
sectors/track, and, if needed, get C by C = size/(H*S).)
<H2><A NAME="verylarge"></A> <A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 IDE problems with 34+ GB disks</A>
</H2>

<P>(Below a discussion of Linux kernel problems. BIOS problems
and jumpers that clip capacity were discussed
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-11.html#jumperbig">above</A>.)
<P>Drives larger than 33.8 GB will not work with kernels older than
2.0.39 / 2.2.14 / 2.3.21.
The details are as follows.
Suppose you bought a new IBM-DPTA-373420 disk with a capacity
of 66835440 sectors (34.2 GB). Pre-2.3.21 kernels will tell you
that the size is 769*16*63 = 775152 sectors (0.4 GB), which
is a bit disappointing. And giving command line parameters
hdc=4160,255,63 doesn't help at all - these are just ignored.
What happens? The routine idedisk_setup()
retrieves the geometry reported by the disk (which is
16383/16/63) and overwrites what the user specified on
the command line, so that the user data is used only
for the BIOS geometry. The routine current_capacity()
or idedisk_capacity() recomputes the cylinder number as
66835440/(16*63)=66305, but since this is stored in a short,
it becomes 769. Since lba_capacity_is_ok() destroyed id->cyls,
every following call to it will return false, so that the
disk capacity becomes 769*16*63.
For several kernels a patch is available.
A patch for 2.0.38 can be found at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/aeb/">ftp.kernel.org</A>.
A patch for 2.2.12 can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9910.2/0636.html">www.uwsg.indiana.edu</A>
(some editing may be required to get rid of the html markup).
The 2.2.14 kernels do support these disks.
In the 2.3.* kernel series, there is support for these disks
since 2.3.21.
One can also `solve' the problem in hardware by
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-11.html#jumperbig">using a jumper</A> to clip the size to 33.8 GB.
In many cases a 
<A HREF="Large-Disk-HOWTO-4.html#biosupgrades">BIOS upgrade</A> will be
required if one wants to boot from the disk.
