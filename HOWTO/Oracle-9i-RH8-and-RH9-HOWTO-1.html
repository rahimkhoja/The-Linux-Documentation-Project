<P>
<P>
<P>I assume that the reader is familiar with Linux file systems, commands
and tools, utilities, shells and shell scripts.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>This document intends to show a simplified installation sequence for
Oracle 9i database on RedHat Linux 8.x and 9.x. It is meant only as an
example and if one intends to follow it, he/she should have in mind 
their own version of Linux, Oracle distribution and specific parameters
of their own PC system.
<P>This document also limits the installation information to Linux only, 
and is not intended to be used for other UNIX brands. To install Oracle
9i in other operating environments, use the Oracle Installation Guide.
<P>I am not a DBA, nor I intend to show high skills in Oracle
Administration, so please, do not ask me DBA questions. I will leave
this task to the experienced DBAs :)
