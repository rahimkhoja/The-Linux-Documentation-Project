NAME="XVOICE">5.1.1. XVoice</H3
><P
>XVoice is a dictation/continuous speech recognizer that can be used 
with a variety of XWindow applications.  It allows user-defined macros.
This is a fine program with a definite future.  Once setup, it 
performs with adequate accuracy.</P
><P
>XVoice requires that you download and install IBM's (free) ViaVoice 
for Linux (See Commercial Section).  It also requires the configuration
of ViaVoice to work correctly.  Additionally, Lesstif/Motif (libXm) is 
required.  It is also important to note that because this program 
interacts with X windows, you must leave X resources open on your 
machine, so caution should be used if you use this on a networked or
multi-user machine.</P

>This software is primarily for users.  An RPM is available. </P

><P
>CVoiceControl (which stands for Console Voice Control) started its 
life as KVoiceControl (KDE Voice Control).  It is a basic speech 
recognition system that allows a user to execute Linux commands by 
using spoken commands.  CVoiceControl replaces KVoiceControl.</P
><P
>The software includes a microphone level configuration utility,
a vocabulary "model editor" for adding new commands and utterances,
and the speech recognition system.</P
><P
>CVoiceControl is an excellent starting point for experienced users
looking to get started in ASR.  It is not the most user friendly,
but once it has been trained correctly, it can be very helpful. Be
sure to read the documentation while setting up.</P

NAME="VIAVOICE">5.2.1. IBM ViaVoice</H3
><P
>IBM has made true on their promise to support Linux with their series
of ViaVoice products for Linux, though the future of their SDKs aren't
set in stone (their licensing agreement for developers isn't officially
released as of this date - more to come). </P
><P
>Their commercial (not-free) product, IBM ViaVoice Dictation for Linux
(available at http://www-4.ibm.com/software/speech/linux/dictation.html)
performs very well, but has some sizeable system requirements compared 
to the more basic ASR systems (64M RAM and 233MHz Pentium).  For the 
$59.95US price tag you also get an Andrea NC-8 microphone.  It also 
allows multiple users (but I haven't tried it with multiple users, so 
if anyone has any experience please give me a shout).  The package 
includes: documentation (PDF), Trainer, dictation system, and 
installation scripts.  Support for additional Linux Distributions based
on 2.2 kernels is also available in the latest release.</P
><P
>  The ASR SDK is available for free, and includes IBM's SMAPI, grammar
API, documentation, and a variety of sample programs.  The ViaVoice
Run Time Kit provides an ASR engine and data files for dictation 
functions, and user utilities.  The ViaVoice Command &#38; Control Run Time
Kit includes the ASR engine and data files for command and control 
functions, and user utilities.  The SDK and Kits require 128M RAM and
a Linux 2.2 or better kernel)</P
