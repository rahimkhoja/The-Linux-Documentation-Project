<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Handling remote mail</A></H2>

<P>
<P>This section describes using POP or IMAP to handle remote mail.
<P>Other options include nfs-mounting the spool partition on client
machines (Danger Will Robinson! Is everyone using the same lock
method?) or using a mail-to-web gateway (quite popular now).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 History </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>On a workstation network, mail has always been a problem:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Either you use "user@computer.foo.com" with problems when "computer" is
down, making your network known to the people outside, having different
addresses for a same person switching to another computer, ... 
</LI>
<LI>Or you take a mail hub, "mailhost.foo.com" with rules for rewriting,
so every user seems to post from the same address, even if they are on
different computers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>But in that case, how can users read their mail?
<P>Using a rsh with elm? :-)
<P>It would overload our mail hub!
One method was forwarding or UUCP, smtp, etc. but it's too complicated.
<P>Then came POP/IMAP, both with security problems at the beginning, (now
fixed using ssh on new versions): a mail program has sometimes to be set
locally (like qmail, smail or vmail if, for example, you use elm, but
mozilla will avoid that!) however, getting and sending Email is simpler.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Getting mail </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Here come POP's main drawbacks:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the password is sent as a clear text on the network,</LI>
<LI>you must choose a POP-aware mailer; many do now (like Pine,
Emacs, Mozilla, Netscape, Mutt, IE, Pegasus, Eudora, Claris...),</LI>
<LI>when a user may roam (read mail from different machines) having
e-mail popped on the computer used yesterday can be a nuisance,</LI>
<LI>some POP servers (e.g. qpopper, ipop3d) on high-use servers can
load the machine significantly. Consider controlling options (such as
not leaving mail on the server) and/or changing the pop server
(e.g. cucipop), as well as avoiding running it from inetd.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The password problem can be solved creating a crypted "channel" to have
POP on it or using APOP or RPOP extensions. The mail reader problem can
be solved either by changing mail reader (don't underestimate the effort
required to re-educate users!) or by using a POP "mail sucker" with a
local mail program.
<P>IMAP can be preferable to POP in various situations like remote (and
especially roaming) access, while you restrict POP to a LAN where
snooping of passwords isn't so much of a concern.  Mark Aitchison
reported a solution here is to use hosts.deny and hosts.allow files
(please see Net-3 HOWTO ; this assumes you are starting pop from
inet).
<P>The policy of leaving mail on the server or not has implications for
server disk space and easier backup/security of the mail, as well as
allowing roaming, so the best solution depends on the type of
organization. Of course, this will not ensure your mail can't be read,
but nobody will be able to delete it ; if all your mail is pgp
encrypted this is a better solution.
<P>Here are some pop programs worth trying:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> gwpop (a Good Way to POP) is very protected since it creates a crypted
"channel" and puts mail directly in the "spool" ; however, it depends on Perl.</LI>
<LI> popclient, simple to use:

For example if your login is john and your password
PrettySecret, you will run:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ popclient -3 -v mail.acme.net -u john -p "PrettySecret" -k -o JOHN-INET-MAIL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


It is strongly discouraged in case of multi-user machine;
other user can see your password by, for example with "ps auxw"
</LI>
<LI> fetchmail, which is actively supported and incredibly simple to use:
it is configured in <CODE>~/.fetchmailrc</CODE>, so you only need to run
<CODE>fetchmail</CODE> when you want to retrive your mail.

Here's my .fetchmailrc:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
poll mail.server protocol pop3:
        forcecr
        password PrettySecret;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Don't forget to "chmod 600 &nbsp;/.fetchmailrc" or fetchmail will ask for it.

Please note that the forcecr option is needed to use fetchmail with
qmail, which strictly respects RFCs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Sending mail </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>For this, you must use smtp-aware mail software, like qmail, smail, vmail
or mozilla (this one does everything: mail reader, POP receive, smtp send!)
<P>Go to one of the previous sections to install and configure the one
you like best. Then, when you will reach "Testing", try to send some
mail to a local account on the mail hub.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Reading mail </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If your program doesn't do everything itself, you can install elm, pgp, mush,
pine ... many good programs are freely available for linux platforms!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Testing </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To check whether your mail server has pop, try:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ telnet mailhost 110
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If it works, you will get something like "OK Pop server (...) starting": type
"quit"!
<P>To install a ssh crypted "channel", first test your mail server typing:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ssh mailhost date
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you get the date, you should be OK. Please note ssh will not ask
for a password, therefore you must create a ".shosts" file on the mail
server, containing client's name. To test ssh port redirection (which
gwpop uses), type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ssh -n -f -L 12314:localhost:110 mailhost sleep 30

then

$ telnet localhost 12314
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then will you hopefully see mail hub's pop banner. If you don't use
ssh, don't forget to comment out $ssh on gwpop script. To check
whether procmail is running, try "procmail -v"
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Using </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Now you can edit gwpop Perl script to check everything is ok, then run gwpop:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gwpop -v your-username
POP password on mailhost: yoursecretpasword
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If gwpop "error messages" are normal, the mail from mail hub will be downloaded
to your local machine wherever you told gwpop to put it.
(please test with some mail!).
<P>You can also use gwpop as a daemon:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ gwpop -d $HOME/tmp your-username
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>gwpop messages are then sent to syslog and gwpop will run endlessly ; a "HUP"
signal will force gwpop to get your mail.
<P>You can get POP software here used on:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.unina.it/pub/Unix/pkgs/network/mail/gwpop
ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail
http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/
