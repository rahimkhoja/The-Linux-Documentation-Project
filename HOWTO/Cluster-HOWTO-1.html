<P> This document describes how we set up our Linux computing clusters
for high-performance computing which we need for 
<A HREF="http://compbio.washington.edu">our research</A>. </P>
<P> Use the information below at your own risk.  I disclaim all
responsibility for anything you may do after reading this HOWTO. The
latest version of this HOWTO will always be available at 
<A HREF="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/linux_cluster.html">http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/linux_cluster.html</A>. </P>
<P> Unlike other documentation that talks about setting up clusters in
a general way, this is a specific description of how our lab is setup
and includes not only details the compute aspects, but also the
desktop, laptop, and public server aspects.  This is done mainly for
local use, but I put it up on the web since I received several e-mail
messages based on my newsgroup query requesting the same information.
Even today, as I plan another 64-node cluster, I find that there is a
dearth of information about exactly how to assemble components to form
a node that works reliably under Linux that includes information not
only about the compute nodes, but about hardware that needs to work
well with the nodes for productive research to happen.  The main use
of this HOWTO as it stands is that it's a report on what kind of
hardware works well with Linux and what kind of hardware doesn't. </P>
