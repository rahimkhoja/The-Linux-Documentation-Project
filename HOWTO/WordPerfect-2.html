<P>WordPerfect is a popular, fully-featured commercial 
word processor program that is available for multiple platforms
including Linux.  It was originally 
written and sold by WordPerfect Corporation, subsequently 
purchased by Novell, then purchased about a year or so ago by
Corel Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario, CA).  Corel has outsourced the
development of WordPerfect for UNIX (including Linux) to SDC Corporation,
a corporation including former WordPerfect developers, and specializing
in development for UNIX and X windows.
<P>
<P>Until the release of Microsoft Word, WordPerfect was the most popular 
word processor for personal computers 
(it still claims to be by volume of product shipped, some reports 
indicate that more copies were sold than Microsoft Word during recent
months). WordPerfect was originally written for DOS and later ported to the 
UNIX and Windows environments.  Initial versions of WordPerfect for
Windows were very late to market and tended to crash a lot, hence opening 
the floodGATES for Microsoft Word.  WordPerfect is still a better word processor
than Word for large documents or documents that must be moved between
Mac, UNIX, and Microsoft platforms.  
<P>
<P>WordPerfect provides a WYSWYG environment for editing text documents.  One
of the best features is the ability to check your spelling as you type.
Included are grammar checker, spelling checker, graphics import and export,
and the ability to edit HTML documents.  Documents created by WordPerfect
on one platform may be read, edited, and printed on other platforms (I
have generated a lot of documents using WP 6.0 (Caldera's release) 
and distributed them to 
Windows 95 users using WP 7.0 or 8.0).
