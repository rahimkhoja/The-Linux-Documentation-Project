>      (From the SCSI HOWTO) All direct access SCSI devices with a
      block size of 256, 512, or 1024 bytes should work. Other block
      sizes will not work (Note that this can often be fixed by changing
      the block and/or sector sizes using the MODE SELECT SCSI
      command).
    </P

>      Large IDE (EIDE) drives work fine with newer kernels. The
      boot partition must lie in the first 1024 cylinders due to PC BIOS
      limitations.

>      Some Conner CFP1060S drives may have problems with Linux and
      ext2fs. The symptoms are inode errors during

      and corrupt file systems. Conner has released a firmware upgrade
      to fix this problem, contact Conner at 1-800-4CONNER (US) or
      +44-1294-315333 (Europe). Have the microcode version (found on
      the drive label, 9WA1.6x) handy when you call.

>      Many Maxtor and Western Digital IDE drives are reported to
      not happily co-exist on the same IDE cable with the other
      manufacturers drive. Usually one of the drives will fail during
      operation. Solution is to put them on different IDE cables.

      BusLogic cards, contact the drive manufacturers for firmware
      upgrades if you suspect problems.

>              NEC D3817, D3825, D3827, D3847 "These drives are
              slightly non-SCSI-2 compliant in the values reported in
              Mode Sense Page 3. In Mode Sense Page 3 all NEC D38x7
              drives report their sector size as zero. The NEC drives
              are the first brand of drive we have ever encountered that
              reported the sector size as zero. Unfortunately, that
              field in Mode Sense Page 3 is not modifiable and there is
              no way to update the firmware on the D38x7 drives to
              correct this problem." Problems are mentioned for D3825
              and D3827 (both revision 0407). Revision 0410 of these two
              hard drives seems to solve this problem.
