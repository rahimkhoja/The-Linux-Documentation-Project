>      This document lists most of the hardware components (not whole
      computers) known to be supported or not supported under Linux, so
      reading through this document you can choose the components for your
      own Linux computer and know what to avoid. As the list of components
      supported by Linux changes constantly, this document will never be
      complete. If a component is not mentioned in this HOWTO, I simply
      have not found support for the component and nobody has told me about
      support.
    </P
><P
>      Subsections titled 'Alpha, Beta drivers' list hardware with alpha or
      beta drivers in varying degrees of usability. Note that some drivers
      only exist in alpha kernels, so if you see something listed as
      supported but isn't in your version of the Linux kernel, upgrade.

>1.1. Notes on binary-only drivers</H2
><P
>        Some devices are supported by binary-only modules; avoid these when
        you can. Binary-only modules are modules which are compiled for ONE
        kernel version. The source code for these modules has NOT been
        released. This may prevent you from upgrading or maintaining your
        system.  It will also prevent you from using the component on
	alternate (usually non-x86) architectures.
      </P

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"I allow binary-only modules, but I want
        people to know that they are _only_ ever expected to
        work on the one version of the kernel that they were compiled

	Tracking these proprietary drivers is beyond the scope of this

>	      Old cruft needs to be eliminated.  Much of this document was
	      written in 1995, give or take, when PCI was new and not
	      supported terribly well, and ISA PnP was seen as something
	      evil.  Oh, how the times have changed...
	    </P
><P
>	      Also, many of the model numbers listed in this document are
	      no longer available, and are probably not of much interest to
	      the vast majority of people.  Personally, I think hardware
	      that hasn't been available for more than 5 years or so can
	      safely be removed.  Old versions of this document will always
	      be available on the Internet...

	In August of 1994, FRiC (Boy of Destiny) took over.  After he fell
	off the face of the planet in late 1995 or early 1996 (and we all
	miss him from IRC, I might add), Patrick Reijnen took over
	(sometime in 1997) and continued to maintain this document until
	late 1999.
