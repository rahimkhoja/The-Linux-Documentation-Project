<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Why write this?</A></H2>

<P>I read over all the other advocacy howtos for Linux that I
could find (I've listed them in the resource section at the end). 
They were almost all addressed to convincing end users (either
business or personal) that Linux could meet their needs on a
day-to-day basis.  That's a very useful thing to do, but it
wasn't what I was looking for. Only the Linux Advocacy Project
came close to what I was looking for, and it didn't quite cover
what I wanted.  I wanted something that would help me approach
organizations making software for other platforms and convince
them to port their works to Linux.  Since I couldn't find any
howto concerning that I decided to write one.
<P>In this howto I'll cover how to approach software companies
and what arguments may be most effective in convincing them to
port their programs to Linux.  I won't talk about trying to
convince them to release their Linux ports under open source
licenses.  While that might be a good idea, I think these things
should be done in small steps.  Advocating a port to another OS
is much more likely to meet with interest than advocating what
the company may perceive as "giving away" product, or advocating
a radical change in their basic development model.
