<P> The applications engineering group in DS produces example designs using the
CPUs and support chipsets. These are typically PC-AT size motherboards, with
all the functionality that you'd typically find on a high-end Pentium
motherboard. Originally, these example designs were intended to be used as
starting points for third-parties to produce motherboard designs from. These
first-generation designs were called Evaluation Boards (EBs). As the
amount of engineering required to build a motherboard has increased (due to
higher-speed clocks and the need to meet RF emission and susceptibility
regulations) the emphasis has shifted towards providing motherboards that
are suitable for volume manufacture.
<P>
<P> Digital's system groups have produced several generations of machines using
Alpha processors. Some of these systems use support logic that is designed by
the systems groups, and some use commodity chipsets from DS. In some cases,
systems use a combination of both.
<P>
<P> Various third-parties build systems using Alpha processors. Some of these
companies design systems from scratch, and others use DS support chipsets,
clone/modify DS example designs or simply package systems using build and
tested boards from DS. 
<P>
<P> The EB64: Obsolete design using 21064 with memory controller implemented
using programmable logic. I/O provided by using programmable logic to interface
a 486&lt;->ISA bridge chip. On-board Ethernet, SuperI/O (2S, 1P, FD), Ethernet
and ISA. PC-AT size. Runs from standard PC power supply.
<P>
<P> The EB64+: Uses 21064 or 21064A and APECs. Has ISA and PCI expansion (3
ISA, 2 PCI, one pair are on a shared slot). Supports 36-bit DRAM SIMs. ISA bus
generated by Intel SaturnI/O PCI-ISA bridge. On-board SCSI (NCR 810 on PCI)
Ethernet (Digital 21040), KBD, MOUSE (PS2 style), SuperI/O (2S, 1P, FD),
RTC/NVRAM. Boot
ROM is EPROM. PC-AT size. Runs from standard PC power supply.
<P>
<P> The EB66: Uses 21066 or 21066A. I/O sub-system is identical to EB64+. Baby
PC-AT size. Runs from standard PC power supply. The EB66 schematic was
published as a marketing poster advertising the 21066 as "the first
microprocessor in the world with embedded PCI" (for trivia fans: there are
actually 2 versions of this poster - I drew the circuits and wrote the spiel
for the first version, and some Americans mauled the spiel for the second
version)
<P>
<P> The EB164: Uses 21164 and ALCOR. Has ISA and PCI expansion (3 ISA slots,
2 64-bit PCI slots (one is shared with an ISA slot) and 2 32-bit PCI slots.
Uses plus-in Bcache SIMMs. I/O sub-system provides SuperI/O (2S, 1P, FD),
KBD, MOUSE (PS2 style), RTC/NVRAM. Boot ROM is Flash. PC-AT-sized motherboard.
Requires power supply with 3.3V output.
<P>
<P> The AlphaPC64 (aka Cabriolet): derived from EB64+ but now baby-AT
with Flash boot ROM, no on-board SCSI or Ethernet. 3 ISA slots, 4 PCI
slots (one pair are on a shared slot), uses plug-in Bcache SIMMs.
Requires power supply with 3.3V output.
<P>
<P> The AXPpci33 (aka NoName), is based on the EB66. This design is produced by
Digital's Technical OEM (TOEM) group. It uses the 21066 processor running at
166MHz or 233MHz. It is a baby-AT size, and runs from a standard PC power
supply. It has 5 ISA slots and 3 PCI slots (one pair are a shared slot). There
are 2 versions, with either PS/2 or large DIN connectors for the keyboard.
<P>
<P> Other 21066-based motherboards: most if not all other 21066-based
motherboards on the market are also based on EB66 - there's really not many
system options when designing a 21066 system, because all the control is done
on-chip.
<P>
<P> Multia (aka the Universal Desktop Box): This is a very compact
pedestal desktop system based on the 21066. It includes 2 PCMCIA
sockets, 21030 (TGA) graphics, 21040 Ethernet and NCR 810 SCSI disk
along with floppy, 2 serial ports and a parallel port. It has limited
expansion capability (one PCI slot) due to its compact size. (There is
some restriction on when you can use the PCI slot, can't remember
what) (Note that 21066A-based and Pentium-based Multia's are also
available).
<P>
<P> DEC PC 150 AXP (aka Jensen): This is a very old Digital system - one of the
first-generation Alpha systems. It is only mentioned here because a number of
these systems seem to be available on the second-hand market. The Jensen is a
floor-standing tower system which used a 150MHz 21064 (later versions used
faster CPUs but I'm not sure what speeds). It used programmable logic to
interface a 486 EISA I/O bridge to the CPU.  
<P>
<P> Other 21064(A) systems: There are 3 or 4 motherboard designs around (I'm
not including Digital <EM>systems</EM> here) and all the ones I know of
are derived from the EB64+ design. These include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>EB64+ (some vendors package the board and sell it unmodified); AT
form-factor.
</LI>
<LI>Aspen Systems motherboard: EB64+ derivative; baby-AT form-factor.
</LI>
<LI>Aspen Systems server board: many PCI slots (includes PCI bridge).
</LI>
<LI>AlphaPC64 (aka Cabriolet), baby AT form-factor.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P> Other 21164(A) systems: The only one I'm aware of that isn't simply
an EB164 clone is a system made by DeskStation. That system is implemented
using a memory and I/O controller proprietary to Desk Station. I don't know
what their attitude towards Linux is.
