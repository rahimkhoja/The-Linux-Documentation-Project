<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">What Bus is my Serial Port On?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you need to find a serial port it often helps if you know what
bus it's on.  If the serial port is on a card, you may know what bus
the card inserts into such as a PCI slot.  But if the serial port is
built into the motherboard it may not be clear what bus it's on.  For
old motherboards that have ISA bus slots, it's likely on the ISA bus
and may not even be Plug-and-Play.  But even if all your slots are
PCI, the serial port is likely to be on either an ISA bus or LPC bus
(also called a "LPC interface").  LPC is common on laptop computers.
Type "lspci" to see if it shows "LPC".  Unfortunately, the LPC bus has
no standard Plug-and-Play method for low-level configuring devices on
it.  But according to the specs, the BIOS is supposed to do such
configuring (using ACPI ??).  To see if you have a LPC bus, type
"lspci" and look for a LPC bridge or the like.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">IO &amp; IRQ Overview</A>
</H2>

<P> For a serial port to work properly it first must be given both an
IO address and an IRQ.  For old hardware (of mid 1990s), jumpers on a
card or a saved BIOS setting does it.  For newer hardware the BIOS
or Linux must set them at boot-time, and the new hardware doesn't
remember how it was set once it's powered down.  Enabling the hardware
(by using software) gives it both an IRQ and an IO address.  Without
an IO address, it can't be used.  Without an IRQ it will need to use
inefficient polling methods for which one must set the IRQ to 0 in the
serial driver.  Using digital signals sent to the hardware by the BIOS
or Linux, it all should get configured automatically (provided the
BIOS has not been previously set up to disable it).  So you only
need to read this if you're having problems or if you want to
understand how it works.</P>
<P>The driver must of course know both the IO address and IRQ so that it
can talk to the serial port chip.   Modern serial port drivers (kernel
2.4) try to determine this by PnP methods so one doesn't normally need
to tell the driver (by using "setserial").   A driver may also set an
IO address or IRQ in the hardware.  But unfortunately, there is some
PCI serial port hardware that the driver doesn't recognize so you
might need to enable the port yourself.  See 
<A HREF="#pci_enabled">PCI: Enabling a disabled port</A></P>
<P>For the old ISA bus, the driver also probes likely serial port
addresses to see if there are any serial ports there.  This works for
the case of jumpers and sometimes works for a ISA PnP port when the
driver doesn't do ISA PnP (prior to kernel 2.4).</P>
<P>Locating the serial port by giving it an IRQ and IO address is
low-level configuring.  It's often automatically done by the serial
driver but sometimes you have to do it yourself.  What follows repeats
what was said above but in more detail.</P>
<P>The low-level configuring consists of assigning an IO address, IRQ,
and names (such as ttyS2) .  This IO-IRQ pair must be set in
both the hardware and told to the serial driver.  And the driver needs
to call this pair a name (such as ttyS2).  We could call this "io-irq"
configuring for short.  The modern way to do this is for the driver to
use PnP methods to detect/set the IO/IRQ and then remember what it
did.  An easy way for a driver to do this is for the driver to ask the
kernel to enable the device and then the kernel tells the driver what
IO/IRQ it has used.  The old way is using the "setserial" program to
tell the driver.  For jumpers, there is no PnP but the driver might
detect the port if the jumpers are set to the usual IO/IRQ.  If you
need to configure but don't understand certain details it's easy to
get into trouble.</P>
<P>When Linux starts, an effort is made to detect and configure
(low-level) the serial ports.  Exactly what happens depends on your
BIOS, hardware, Linux distribution, kernel version, etc.  If the
serial ports work OK, there may be no need for you to do any more
low-level configuring.</P>
<P>If you're having problems with the serial ports, then you may need to
do low-level configuring.  If you have kernel 2.2 or lower, 
then you need to do it if you:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Plan to use more than 2 ISA serial ports</LI>
<LI> Are installing a new serial port (such as an internal modem)</LI>
<LI> One or more of your serial ports have non-standard IRQs or IO
addresses</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Starting with kernel 2.2 you may be able to use more than 2 serial
ports without doing any low-level configuring by sharing interrupts.
All PCI ports should support this but for ISA it only works for some
hardware.  It may be just as easy to give each port a unique interrupt
if they are available.  See 
<A HREF="#int_share-2.2">Interrupt sharing and Kernels 2.2+</A></P>
<P>The low-level configuring (setting the IRQ and IO address) seems to
cause people more trouble than the high-level stuff, although for many
it's fully automatic and there is no configuring to be done.  Until
the port is enabled and the serial driver knows the correct IRQ and IO
address, the port will not usually not work at all.  </P>
<P>A port may be disabled, either by the BIOS or by failure of Linux to
find and enable the port.  For modern ports (provided the BIOS hasn't
disabled them) manual PnP tools such as lspci should be able to find
them.  Applications, and utilities such as "setserial" and "scanport"
(Debian only ??) only probe IO addresses, don't use PnP tools, and
thus can't detect disabled ports. </P>
<P>Even if an ISA port can be found by the probing done by the serial
driver it may work extremely slow if the IRQ is wrong.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-16.html#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A>.  PCI ports are less likely to get the IRQ wrong.</P>
<P>IO address, IRQs, etc. are called "resources" and we are thus
configuring certain resources.  But there are many other types of
"resources" so the term has many other meanings.  In summary, the
low-level configuring consists of enabling the device, giving it a
name (ttyS2 for example) and putting two values (an IRQ number and IO
address) into two places:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The device driver (done by PnP or "<CODE>setserial</CODE>")</LI>
<LI> Configuration registers of the serial port hardware itself,
done by PnP software (or jumpers on legacy hardware).</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>You may watch the start-up (= boot-time) messages.  They are usually
correct.  But if you're having problems, your serial port may not show
up at all or if you do see a message from  "setserial" it may not
show the true configuration of the hardware (and it is not necessarily
supposed to).  See 
<A HREF="#boot_mesgs">I/O Address &amp; IRQ: Boot-time messages</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="PCI_ser_conf"></A> <A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.3">PCI Bus Support </A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>



<P>If you have kernel 2.4 or better, then there should be support for PnP
for both the PCI and ISA buses (either built-in or by modules).  Some
PCI serial ports can be automatically detected and low-level
configured by the serial driver.  Others may not be.  </P>
<P>While kernel 2.2 supported PCI in general, it had no support for PCI
serial ports (although some people got them working anyway).  Starting
with kernel 2.4, the serial driver will read the id number digitally
stored in the serial hardware to determine how to support it (if it
knows how).  It should assign an I/O address to it, determine its
IRQ, etc.  So you don't need to use "setserial" for it.  </P>
<P>There is a possible problem if you don't use the device filesystem.
The driver may assign the port to say tt/ttyS4 per a boot-time
message (use <CODE>dmesg</CODE> to see it).  But if you don't have a "file"
/dev/ttyS4 then the port will not work.  So you will then need to
create it, using<BR>
<CODE>cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV ttyS4</CODE><BR></P>

<H3>More info on PCI</H3>

<P>PCI ports are not well standardized.  Some use main memory for
communication with the PC.  Some require special enabling of the IRQ.
The output of "lspci -vv" can help determine if one can be supported.
If you see a 4-digit IO port, the port might work by just telling
"setserial" the IO port and the IRQ.  
For example, if lspci shows IRQ 10, I/O at 0xecb8 and you decide to
name it ttyS2 then the command is:</P>
<P>setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 10 port 0xecb8 autoconfig</P>
<P>Note that the boot-time message "Probing PCI hardware" means reading
the PnP configuration registers in the PCI devices which detects info
about all PCI cards and on-board PCI devices.  This is different than
the probing of IO addresses by the serial driver which means reading
certain IO addresses to see if what's read looks like there's a serial
port at that address.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.4">Common mistakes made re low-level configuring</A>
</H2>

<P> Here are some common mistakes people make:
<UL>
<LI>setserial command: They run it (without the "autoconfig" and
auto_irq options) and think it has checked the hardware to see if
what it shows is correct (it hasn't).</LI>
<LI>setserial messages:  They see them displayed on the screen at
boot-time (or by giving the setserial command) and erroneously think
that the result always shows how their hardware is actually
configured.</LI>
<LI>/proc/interrupts: When their serial device isn't in use they
don't see its interrupt there, and erroneously conclude that their
serial port can't be found (or doesn't have an interrupt set).</LI>
<LI>/proc/ioports and /proc/tty/driver/serial: People think this
shows the actual hardware configuration when it only shows about the
same info (possibly erroneous) as setserial.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="what_is_io_irq"></A> <A NAME="ss8.5">8.5</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.5">IRQ &amp; IO Address Must be Correct </A>
</H2>

<P>There are really two answers to the question "What is my IO and
IRQ?" 1. What the device driver thinks has been set (This is what
setserial usually sets and shows.).  2. What is actually set in the
hardware.  Both 1. and 2. above should be the same.  If they're not it
spells trouble since the driver has incorrect info on the physical
serial port.  In some cases the hardware is disabled so it has no IO
address or IRQ.</P>
<P>If the driver has the wrong IO address it will try to send data to a
non-existing serial port --or even worse, to some other device.  If it
has the wrong IRQ the driver will not get interrupt service requests
from the serial port, resulting in a very slow or no response.  See
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-16.html#slow_">Extremely Slow: Text appears on the screen slowly after long delays</A>.  If it has the wrong model of UART there
is also apt to be trouble.  To determine if both IO-IRQ pairs are
identical you must find out how they are set in both the driver and
the hardware.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.6">What is the IO Address and IRQ per the driver ?</A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>What the driver thinks is not necessarily how the hardware is
actually set.  If everything works OK then what the driver thinks is
likely correct (set in the hardware) and you don't need to investigate
(unless you're curious or want to become a guru).  Ways to determine
what the driver thinks include: boot-time messages 
<A HREF="#boot_mesgs">I/O Address &amp; IRQ: Boot-time messages</A>, the
/proc directory "files" 
<A HREF="#proc_dir">The /proc directory and setserial</A>, and the "setserial" command.</P>


<H3><A NAME="boot_mesgs"></A> I/O Address &amp; IRQ: Boot-time messages </H3>

<P> In many cases your ports will automatically get low-level
configured at boot-time (but not always correctly).  To see what is
happening, look at the start-up messages on the screen.  Don't neglect
to check the messages from the BIOS before Linux is loaded (no
examples shown here).  These BIOS messages may be frozen by pressing
the Pause key (while holding down shift).  It's often tricky to freeze
them and you may need to hit Ctrl-Alt-Del while Linux is booting to
start rebooting and try again.  What these messages display may change
as booting progresses and it's often tricky to freeze it at exactly the
right words.</P>
<P>Use Shift-PageUp to scroll back to the messages after they have
flashed by.  Shift-PageDown will scroll in the opposite direction.
The <CODE>dmesg</CODE> command (or looking at logs in /var/log) will show only
the first of these two messages.  Here's an example of the start-up
messages (as of 2004, almost the same as for 1999).  Note that in
older versions ttyS1 was displayed in these messages as ttyS01, etc.</P>
<P>At first you see what was detected (but the irq is only a wild guess):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Serial driver version 4.27 with no serial options enabled
ttyS0 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS2 at 0x03e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS4 at port 0xeff0 (irq = 10) is a 16550A
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note that ttyS0-ttyS2 were detected by probing the standard addresses
while ttyS4 is a PCI port detected by probing the PCI configuration.
Later setserial shows you  what was saved in a configuration file
(which you may edit), but it's not necessarily correct either:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Loading the saved-state of the serial devices...
/dev/ttyS1 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
/dev/ttyS2 at 0x03e8 (irq = 5) is a 16550A
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note that the configuration file only had ttyS1-2 in it so that ttyS0
and ttyS4 were not affected by it.  There is also a slight
discrepancy: The first message shows ttyS2 at irq=4 while the second
shows it at irq=5.  In most cases the second message is the correct
one.  But if you're having trouble, it may be misleading.  Before reading
the explanation of all of this complexity in the rest of this section,
you might just try using your serial port and see if it works OK.  If
so it may not be essential to read further.</P>
<P>The second message is from the <CODE>setserial</CODE> program being run at
boot-time from a script in the /etc directory tree.  It shows what the
device driver thinks is the correct configuration.  But this too could
be wrong.  For example, the irq could actually be set to irq=8 in the
hardware (both messages wrong).  The irq=5 could be there because the
configuration file is incorrect.  </P>
<P>With old jumper-set serial ports Linux sometimes gets IRQs wrong
because it doesn't by default probe for IRQs.  It just assumes the
"standard" ones (first message) or accepts what is in a configuration
file (second message).  Neither of these is necessarily correct.  If
the serial driver has the wrong IRQ, the serial port is very slow or
doesn't seem to work at all.</P>
<P>The first message is a result of Linux probing the ISA serial port
addresses but it doesn't probe for IRQs.  If a port shows up here it
exists but the IRQ may be wrong.  Linux doesn't check IRQs because
doing so is not foolproof.  It just assumes the IRQs are as shown
because they are the "standard" values.  You may check them manually
with <CODE>setserial</CODE> using the <CODE>autoconfig</CODE> and <CODE>auto_irq</CODE>
options but this isn't guaranteed to be correct either.</P>
<P>The data shown by the BIOS messages (which you see at first before
Linux is booted) are what is initially set in the hardware.  If your
serial port is Plug-and-Play (PnP) then it's possible that "isapnp" or
"setpci" will run and change these settings.  Look for messages about
this after Linux starts.  The last serial port message shown in the
example above should agree with the BIOS messages (as possibly
modified by isapnp or setpci).  If they don't agree then you either
need to change the setting in the port hardware or use setserial to
tell the driver what is actually set in the hardware.</P>
<P>Also, if you have Plug-and-Play (PnP) serial ports, they can only be
found by PnP software unless the IRQ and IO has been set inside the
hardware by Plug-and-Play software.  Prior to kernel 2.4 this was a
common reason why the start-up messages did not show a serial port
that physically exists.  A PnP BIOS may automatically low-level
configure them.  PnP configuring will be explained later.</P>

<H3><A NAME="proc_dir"></A> The /proc directory and setserial  </H3>

<P> Type "setserial -g /dev/ttyS*".   There are some other
ways to find this info by looking at "files" in the /proc directory.
Be warned that there is no guarantee that the same is set in the
hardware.</P>
<P><CODE>/proc/ioports</CODE> will show the IO addresses that the drivers are using.
<CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> shows the IRQs that are used by drivers of
currently running processes (that have devices open).  It shows how
many interrupts have actually be issued.
<CODE>/proc/tty/driver/serial</CODE> shows much of the above, plus the
number of bytes that have been received and sent (even if the device
is not now open).</P>
<P>Note that for the IO addresses and IRQ assignments, you are only seeing
what the driver thinks and not necessarily what is actually set in the
hardware.  The data on the actual number of interrupts issued and
bytes processed is real however.  If you see a large number of
interrupts and/or bytes then it probably means that the device is (or
was) working.  But the interrupts might be from another device.  If
there are no bytes received (rx:0) but bytes were transmitted (tx:3749
for example), then only one direction of flow is working (or being
utilized).</P>
<P>Sometimes a showing of just a few interrupts doesn't mean that the
interrupt is actually being physically generated by any serial port.
Thus if you see almost no interrupts for a port that you're trying to
use, that interrupt might not be set in the hardware.  To view
/proc/interrupts to check on a program that you're currently running
(such as "minicom") you need to keep the program running while you
view it.</P>

<H2><A NAME="io-irq_in_hdw"></A> <A NAME="ss8.7">8.7</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.7">What is the IO Address &amp; IRQ of my Serial Port Hardware?</A>
 </H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>If it's PCI or ISA PnP then what's set in the hardware has been done
by PnP methods.  Even if nothing has been set or the port disabled,
PnP ports may still be found by using "lspci -v" or "isapnp
--dumpregs".  Ports disabled by jumpers (or hardware failures) are
completely lost.  See 
<A HREF="#isa_pnp_dump">ISA PnP ports</A>,
<A HREF="#pci_io_irq">PCI: What IOs and IRQs have been set?</A>,
<A HREF="#pci_enabled">PCI: Enabling a disabled port</A></P>
<P>PnP ports don't store their configuration in the hardware when the
power is turned off.  This is in contrast to Jumpers (non-PnP) which
remain the same with the power off.  That's why a PnP port is more
likely to be found in a disabled state than an old non-PnP one.</P>

<H3><A NAME="pci_io_irq"></A> PCI: What IOs and IRQs have been set? </H3>

<P> For PCI, the BIOS almost always sets the IRQ and may set the IO
address as well.  To see how it's set use "lspci -vv" (best) or look
in /proc/bus/pci (or for kernels &lt;2.2 /proc/pci).  The modem's
serial port is often called a "Communication controller".  Look for
this.  If lspci shows "I/O ports at ... [disabled]" then the serial
port is disabled and the hardware has no IO address so it's lost and
can't be used.  See 
<A HREF="#pci_enabled">PCI: Enabling a disabled port</A> for how to enable it.</P>
<P>If more than one IO address is shown, the first one is more likely to
be it.  You can't change the IRQ (at least not with "setpci")   This
is because if one writes an IRQ it it's hardware register no action is
taken on it.  It's the BIOS that should actually set up the IRQs and
then write the correct value to this register for lspci to view.  If
you must, change the IO address with "setpci" by changing the
BASE_ADDRESS_0 or the like.  </P>

<H3><A NAME="pci_enabled"></A> PCI: Enabling a disabled port </H3>

<P>If the port communicates via an IO address then "lspci -vv" should
show "Control: I/O+ ..." with + meaning that the IO address is
enabled.  If it shows "I/O-" (and "I/O ports at ... [disabled]") then
you may need to use the setpci command to enable it.  For example
"setpci -d 151f:000 command=101".  151f is the vendor id, and 000 is
the device id both obtained from "lspci -n -v" or from /proc/bus/pci
or from "scanpci -v".  The "command=101" means that 101 is put into
the command register which is the same as the "Control" register
displayed by "lspci".  The 101h sets two bits: the 1 sets I/O to + and
the 100 part keeps SERR# set to +.   In this case only the SERR# bit
of the Control register was initially observed to be + when the lspci
command was run.  So we kept it enabled to + by setting bit 8 (where
bit 0 is I/O) to 1 by the first 1 in 101.  Some serial cards don't use
SERR# so if you see SERR#- then there's no need to enable it so then
use: command=1.  Then you'll need to set up "setserial" to tell the
driver the IO and IRQ.</P>
<P>Bit 8 is actually the 9th bit since we started counting bits from 0.
Don't be alarmed that lspci shows a lot of - signs showing that the
card doesn't have many features available (or enabled).  Serial ports
are relatively slow and don't need these features.</P>
<P>Another way to enable it is to let the BIOS do it by telling the BIOS
that you don't have a plug-and-play operating system.  Then the BIOS
should enable it when you start your PC. If you have MS Windows9x on
the same PC then doing this might cause problems with Windows (see
Plug-and-Play-HOWTO).</P>

<H3><A NAME="isa_pnp_dump"></A> ISA PnP ports </H3>

<P>For an ISA Plug-and-Play (PnP) port one may try the <CODE>pnpdump</CODE>
program (part of <CODE>isapnptools</CODE>).  If you use the --dumpregs option
then it should tell you the actual IO address and IRQ set in the port.
It should also find an ISA PnP port that is disabled.  The address it
"trys" is not the device's IO address, but a special address used for
communicating with PnP cards.</P>

<H3>Finding a port that is not disabled (ISA, PCI, PnP, non-PnP)</H3>

<P> Perhaps the BIOS messages will tell you some info before Linux
starts booting.  Use the shift-PageUp key to step back thru the
boot-time messages and look at the very first ones which are from the
BIOS.  This is how it was before Linux started.  Setserial can't
change it but isapnp or setpci can.  Starting with kernel 2.4, the
serial driver can make such changes for many (but not all) serial
ports.</P>
<P>Using "scanport" (Debian only ??) will probe all I/O ports and will
indicate what it thinks may be serial port.  After this you could try
probing with setserial using the "autoconfig" option.  You'll need to
guess the addresses to probe at (using clues from "scanport").  See
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-11.html#set_serial">What is Setserial</A>.</P>
<P>For a port set with jumpers, the IO ports and IRQs are set per the
jumpers. If the port is not Plug-and-Play (PnP) but has been setup by
using a DOS program, then it's set at whatever the person who ran that
program set it to.</P>

<H3>Exploring via MS Windows (a last resort)</H3>

<P>For PnP ports, checking on how it's configured under DOS/Windows
may (or may not) imply how it's under Linux.  MS Windows stores its
configuration info in its Registry which is not used by Linux so they
are not necessarily configured the same.  If you let a PnP BIOS
automatically do the configuring when you start Linux (and have told
the BIOS that you don't have a PnP operating system when starting
Linux) then Linux should use whatever configuration is in the BIOS's
non-volatile memory.  Windows also makes use of the same non-volatile
memory but doesn't necessarily configure it that way.</P>

<H2><A NAME="choose_IRQ"></A> <A NAME="ss8.8">8.8</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.8">Choosing Serial IRQs </A>
</H2>

<P> If you have Plug-and-Play ports then either a PnP BIOS or a
serial driver may configure all your devices for you so then you may
not need to choose any IRQs.  PnP software determines what it thinks
is best and assigns them (but it's not always best).  But if you
directly use isapnp (ISA bus) or jumpers then you have to choose.  If
you already know what IRQ you want to use you could skip this section
except that you may want to know that IRQ 0 has a special use (see the
following paragraph).</P>

<H3>IRQ 0 is not an IRQ</H3>

<P> While IRQ 0 is actually the timer (in hardware) it has a special
meaning for setting a serial port with setserial.  It tells the driver
that there is no interrupt for the port and the driver then will use
polling methods.  Such polling puts more load on the CPU but can be
tried if there is an interrupt conflict or mis-set interrupt.  The
advantage of assigning IRQ 0 is that you don't need to know what
interrupt is set in the hardware.  It should be used only as a
temporary expedient until you are able to find a real interrupt to
use.</P>

<H3><A NAME="int_share-2.2"></A> Interrupt sharing,  Kernels 2.2+ </H3>

<P> Sharing of IRQs is where two devices use the same IRQ.  As a
general rule, this wasn't allowed for the ISA bus.   The PCI bus may
share IRQs but one can't share the same IRQ between the ISA and the
PCI bus.  Most multi-port boards may share IRQs.  Sharing is not as
efficient since every time a shared interrupt is given a check must be
made to determine where it came from.  Thus if it's feasible, it's
nicer to allocate every device its own interrupt.</P>
<P>Prior to kernel 2.2, serial IRQs could not be shared with each other
except for most multiport boards.  Starting with kernel 2.2 serial
IRQs may be sometimes shared between serial ports.  In order for
sharing to work in 2.2 the kernel must have been compiled with
CONFIG_SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ, and the serial port hardware must support
sharing (so that if two serial cards put different voltages on the
same interrupt wire, only the voltage that means "this is an
interrupt" will prevail).  Since the PCI bus specs permit sharing, any
PCI card should allow sharing.</P>

<H3>What IRQs to choose?</H3>

<P> The serial hardware often has only a limited number of IRQs.  Also
you don't want IRQ conflicts.  So there may not be much of a choice.
Your PC may normally come with <CODE>ttyS0</CODE> and <CODE>ttyS2</CODE> at IRQ 4, and
<CODE>ttyS1</CODE> and <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at IRQ 3.  Looking at
<CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> will show which IRQs are being used by
programs currently running.  You likely don't want to use one of
these.  Before IRQ 5 was used for sound cards, it was often used for a
serial port.</P>
<P>Here is how Greg (original author of Serial-HOWTO) set his up in
/etc/rc.d/rc.serial.  rc.serial is a file (shell script) which runs at
start-up (it may have a different name or location).  For versions of
"setserial" after 2.15 it's not always done this way anymore but this
example does show the choice of IRQs.</P>

<P>There is really no Right Thing to do when choosing interrupts.  Try to
find one that isn't being used by the motherboard, or any other
boards.  2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 or 15 are possible choices.  Note
that IRQ 2 is the same as IRQ 9.  You can call it either 2 or 9, the
serial driver is very understanding.  If you have a very old serial
board it may not be able to use IRQs 8 and above.</P>
<P>Make sure you don't use IRQs 1, 6, 8, 13 or 14!  These are used by
your motherboard.  You will make her very unhappy by taking her IRQs.
When you are done you might want to double-check
<CODE>/proc/interrupts</CODE> when programs that use interrupts are being
run and make sure there are no conflicts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="choose_address"></A> <A NAME="ss8.9">8.9</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.9">Choosing Addresses --Video card conflict with ttyS3</A>
</H2>

<P> Here's a problem with some old serial cards.  The IO address of
the IBM 8514 video board (and others like it) is allegedly 0x?2e8
where ? is 2, 4, 8, or 9.  This may conflict with the IO address of
<CODE>ttyS3</CODE> at 0x02e8.  Your may think that this shouldn't happen since
the addresses are different in the high order digit (the leading 0 in
02e8).  You're right, but a poorly designed serial port may ignore the
high order digit and respond to any address that ends in 2e8.  That is
bad news if you try to use <CODE>ttyS3</CODE> (ISA bus) at this IO address.</P>
<P>For the ISA bus you should try to use the default addresses shown
below.  PCI cards use different addresses so as not to conflict with
ISA addresses.  The addresses shown below represent the first address
of an 8-byte range.  For example 3f8 is really the range 3f8-3ff.
Each serial device (as well as other types of devices that use IO
addresses) needs its own unique address range.  There should be no
overlaps (conflicts).  Here are the default addresses for commonly
used serial ports on the ISA bus:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ttyS0 address 0x3f8
ttyS1 address 0x2f8
ttyS2 address 0x3e8
ttyS3 address 0x2e8
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Suppose there is an address conflict (as reported by <CODE>setserial -g
/dev/ttyS*</CODE>) between a real serial port and another port which
does not physically exist (and shows UART: unknown).  Such a conflict
shouldn't cause problems but it sometimes does in older kernels.  To
avoid this problem don't permit such address conflicts or delete
/dev/ttySx if it doesn't physically exist.</P>

<H2><A NAME="io-irq_methods"></A> <A NAME="ss8.10">8.10</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.10">Set IO Address &amp; IRQ in the hardware (mostly for PnP)</A>
 </H2>

<P> After it's set in the hardware don't forget to insure that it also
gets set in the driver by using <CODE>setserial</CODE>.  For non-PnP serial
ports they are either set in hardware by jumpers or by running a DOS
program ("jumperless") to set them (it may disable PnP).  The rest of
this subsection is only for PnP serial ports.  Here's a list of the
possible methods of configuring PnP serial ports:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Using a PnP BIOS CMOS setup menu
(usually only for external
devices
on ttyS0 (Com1) and ttyS1 (Com2))</LI>
<LI> Letting a PnP BIOS automatically configure a PnP serial port
See 
<A HREF="#bios_conf">Using a PnP BIOS to IO-IRQ Configure</A></LI>
<LI> Doing nothing if the serial driver recognized your card OK</LI>
<LI> Using <CODE>isapnp</CODE> for a PnP serial port (non-PCI)</LI>
<LI> Using setpci (pciutils or pcitools) for the PCI bus</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The IO address and IRQ must be set (by PnP) in their registers each
time the system is powered on since PnP hardware doesn't remember how
it was set when the power is shut off.  A simple way to do this is to
let a PnP BIOS know that you don't have a PnP OS and the BIOS will
automatically do this each time you start.  This might cause problems
in Windows (which is a PnP OS) if you start Windows with the BIOS
thinking that Windows is not a PnP OS.  See Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.</P>
<P>Plug-and-Play (PnP) was designed to automate this io-irq configuring,
but for Linux it initially made life much more complicated.  In modern
Linux (2.4 kernels --partially in 2.2 kernels), each device driver has
to do its own PnP (using supplied software which it may utilize).
There is unfortunately no centralized planning for assigning IO
addresses and IRQs as there is in MS Windows.   But it usually works
out OK in Linux anyway.</P>

<H3><A NAME="bios_conf"></A> Using a PnP BIOS to IO-IRQ Configure </H3>

<P> While the explanation of how to use setpci or isapnp for io-irq
configuring should come with such software, this is not the case if
you want to let a PnP BIOS do such configuring.  Not all PnP BIOS can
do this.  The BIOS usually has a CMOS menu for setting up the first
two serial ports.  This menu may be hard to find.  For an "Award"
BIOS it was found under "chipset features setup"  There is often
little to choose from.  For ISA serial ports, the first two ports
normally get set at the standard IO addresses and IRQs.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-10.html#dev_nos">More on Serial Port Names</A></P>
<P>Whether you like it or not, when you start up a PC, a PnP BIOS starts
to do PnP (io-irq) configuring of hardware devices.  It may do the job
partially and turn the rest over to a PnP OS (which Linux is in some
sense) or if thinks you don't have a PnP OS it may fully configure all
the PnP devices but not configure the device drivers.</P>
<P>If you tell the BIOS that you don't have a PnP OS, then the PnP BIOS
should do the configuring of all PnP serial ports --not just the first
two.  An indirect way to control what the BIOS does (if you have
Windows 9x on the same PC) is to "force" a configuration under
Windows.  See Plug-and-Play-HOWTO and search for "forced".  It's
easier to use the CMOS BIOS menu which may override what you
"forced" under Windows.  There could be a BIOS option that can set or
disable this "override" capability.</P>
<P>If you add a new PnP device, the BIOS should PnP configure it.  It
could even change the io-irq of existing devices if required to avoid
any conflicts.  For this purpose, it keeps a list of non-PnP devices
provided that you have told the BIOS how these non-PnP devices are
io-irq configured.  One way to tell the BIOS this is by running a
program called ICU under DOS/Windows.</P>
<P>But how do you find out what the BIOS has done so that you set up the
device drivers with this info?  The BIOS itself may provide some info,
either in its setup menus of via messages on the screen when you turn
on your computer.  See 
<A HREF="#io-irq_in_hdw">What is set in my serial port hardware?</A>.  Other ways of finding out is to use lspci for
the PCI bus or isapnp --dumpregs for the ISA bus.  The cryptic results
it shows you may not be clear to a novice.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.11">8.11</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc8.11">Giving the IRQ and IO Address to Setserial</A>
</H2>

<P> Once you've set the IRQ and IO address in the hardware (or arranged
for it to be done by PnP) you also need to insure that the "setserial"
command is run each time you start Linux.  See the subsection
