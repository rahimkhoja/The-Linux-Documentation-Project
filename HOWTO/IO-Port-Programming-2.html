<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Using I/O ports in C programs</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The normal method</A>
</H2>

<P>Routines for accessing I/O ports are in <CODE>/usr/include/asm/io.h</CODE>
(or <CODE>linux/include/asm-i386/io.h</CODE> in the kernel source
distribution). The routines there are inline macros, so it is enough
to <CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE>; you do not need any additional
libraries.
<P>Because of a limitation in gcc (present in all versions I know of,
including egcs), you <EM>have to</EM> compile any source code that uses
these routines with optimisation turned on (<CODE>gcc -O1</CODE> or higher),
or alternatively use <CODE>#define extern static</CODE> before you
<CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE> (remember to <CODE>#undef
extern</CODE>afterwards).
<P>For debugging, you can use <CODE>gcc -g -O</CODE> (at least with modern
versions of gcc), though optimisation can sometimes make the debugger
behave a bit strangely. If this bothers you, put the routines that use
I/O port access in a separate source file and compile only that with
optimisation turned on.
<P>
<H3>Permissions</H3>

<P>Before you access any ports, you must give your program permission to
do so. This is done by calling the <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> function (declared
in <CODE>unistd.h</CODE>, and defined in the kernel) somewhere near the start
of your program (before any I/O port accesses). The syntax is
<CODE>ioperm(from, num, turn_on)</CODE>, where <CODE>from</CODE> is the first port
number to give access to, and <CODE>num</CODE> the number of consecutive ports
to give access to. For example, <CODE>ioperm(0x300, 5, 1)</CODE> would give
access to ports 0x300 through 0x304 (a total of 5 ports). The last
argument is a Boolean value specifying whether to give access to the
program to the ports (true (1)) or to remove access (false (0)). You
can call <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> multiple times to enable multiple
non-consecutive ports. See the <CODE>ioperm(2)</CODE> manual page for details
on the syntax.
<P>The <CODE>ioperm()</CODE> call requires your program to have root privileges;
thus you need to either run it as the root user, or make it setuid
root. You can drop the root privileges after you have called
<CODE>ioperm()</CODE> to enable the ports you want to use. You are not
required to explicitly drop your port access privileges with
<CODE>ioperm(..., 0)</CODE> at the end of your program; this is done
automatically as the process exits.
<P>A <CODE>setuid()</CODE> to a non-root user does not disable the port access
granted by <CODE>ioperm()</CODE>, but a <CODE>fork()</CODE> does (the child process
does not get access, but the parent retains it).
<P><CODE>ioperm()</CODE> can only give access to ports 0x000 through 0x3ff; for
higher ports, you need to use <CODE>iopl()</CODE> (which gives you access to
all ports at once). Use the level argument 3 (i.e., <CODE>iopl(3)</CODE>) to
give your program access to <EM>all</EM> I/O ports (so be careful ---
accessing the wrong ports can do all sorts of nasty things to your
computer). Again, you need root privileges to call <CODE>iopl()</CODE>. See
the <CODE>iopl(2)</CODE> manual page for details.
<P>
<H3>Accessing the ports</H3>

<P>
<P>To input a byte (8 bits) from a port, call <CODE>inb(port)</CODE>, it returns
the byte it got. To output a byte, call <CODE>outb(value, port)</CODE> (please
note the order of the parameters). To input a word (16 bits) from
ports <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>x+1</CODE> (one byte from each to form the word, using
the assembler instruction <CODE>inw</CODE>), call <CODE>inw(x)</CODE>. To output a
word to the two ports, use <CODE>outw(value, x)</CODE>. If you're unsure of
which port instructions (byte or word) to use, you probably want
<CODE>inb()</CODE> and <CODE>outb()</CODE> --- most devices are designed for bytewise
port access. Note that all port access instructions take at least
about a microsecond to execute.
<P>The <CODE>inb_p()</CODE>, <CODE>outb_p()</CODE>, <CODE>inw_p()</CODE>, and <CODE>outw_p()</CODE>
macros work otherwise identically to the ones above, but they do an
additional short (about one microsecond) delay after the port access;
you can make the delay about four microseconds with <CODE>#define
REALLY_SLOW_IO</CODE> before you <CODE>#include &lt;asm/io.h&gt;</CODE>. These
macros normally (unless you <CODE>#define SLOW_IO_BY_JUMPING</CODE>, which
is probably less accurate) use a port output to port 0x80 for their
delay, so you need to give access to port 0x80 with <CODE>ioperm()</CODE>
first (outputs to port 0x80 should not affect any part of the
system). For more versatile methods of delaying, read on.
<P>There are manual pages for <CODE>ioperm(2)</CODE>, <CODE>iopl(2)</CODE>, and the above
macros in reasonably recent releases of the Linux manual page
collection.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 An alternate method: <CODE>/dev/port</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Another way to access I/O ports is to <CODE>open()</CODE> <CODE>/dev/port</CODE> (a
character device, major number 1, minor 4) for reading and/or writing
(the stdio <CODE>f*()</CODE> functions have internal buffering, so avoid
them). Then <CODE>lseek()</CODE> to the appropriate byte in the file (file
position 0 = port 0x00, file position 1 = port 0x01, and so on), and
<CODE>read()</CODE> or <CODE>write()</CODE> a byte or word from or to it.
<P>Naturally, for this to work your program needs read/write access to
<CODE>/dev/port</CODE>. This method is probably slower than the normal
method above, but does not need compiler optimisation nor
<CODE>ioperm()</CODE>. It doesn't need root access either, if you give a
non-root user or group access to <CODE>/dev/port</CODE> --- but this is a
very bad thing to do in terms of system security, since it is possible
to hurt the system, perhaps even gain root access, by using
<CODE>/dev/port</CODE> to access hard disks, network cards, etc. directly.
<P>You cannot use <CODE>select(2)</CODE> or <CODE>poll(2)</CODE> to read /dev/port,
because the hardware does not have a facility for notifying the CPU
when a value in an input port changes.
