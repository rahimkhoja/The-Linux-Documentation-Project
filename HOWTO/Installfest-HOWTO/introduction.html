>&#13;    This document provides some guidelines that should help you
    run a successful installfest. 
    For purposes of this document, an installfest is a gathering at
    which experienced Linux users assist less experienced users with the
    installation and configuration of Linux distributions,
    and where Linux users can
    bring Linux systems to receive assistance with system problem
    remediation.
    </P
><P
>&#13;    Please take from this document whatever you want. It is meant to be
    a guide, not a recipe that must be followed exactly 
    to have a successful installfest.
    Any installfest where most of the people leave happy is a 
    successful event.
