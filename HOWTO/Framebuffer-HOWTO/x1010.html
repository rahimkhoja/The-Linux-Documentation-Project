>11.1. Introduction</H2
><P
>The main goal of this document is to get you
				started with running a dual head configuration
				of Linux.  While this process is pretty
				straight forward there are numerous things that
				one can do wrong along the way.</P
><P
>The example I concentrate on is getting an
				X-server running on a second monitor.  I find
				this nice as you can usually find old large 19"
				to 21" fixed frequency monitors around that
				people are giving away because they can't use
				them.  This way you can boot off a small
				multisync and then use X on a nice big
				monitor.</P
><P
>Please understand dual head support is currently
				developing so this information changes rapidly.
				Anything in this document could be out of date
				or just plain incorrect by the time you are
				reading this.</P

>** WARNING ** This document was written before
				any XFree86 4.0 release.  If you are reading
				this and XFree86 4.0 is already released many

>11.9. Getting Started</H2
><P
>The first thing you'll need to do is to patch a
				copy of the Linux source with the
				"fbaddon" patch.  Then you need to
				configure the kernel and turn on frame buffer
				support.  If you have Matrox cards turn on
				Matrox unified accelerated driver support as
				well as the particular type of card you have.
				Don't turn on VESA frame buffer support. It can
				cause a conflict.  Do turn on multi-head
				support (obviously). Build the kernel and
				reboot.</P
><P
>Now you need to install the "fbset"
				program and carefully read all the
				documentation on how to adjust the settings.
				Using a "/etc/fb.modes" file is
				highly recommended once you've decided on your
				settings.  The fbset program includes a Perl
				script to convert your XF86Config file to
				fb.modes settings.  I've included my
				octave/Borne shell script to convert your
				XF86Config file in Appendix A &#38; B.</P
><P
>You need to get comfortable with using the frame
				buffer device on one monitor, understanding any
				issues that can arise from your set up that
				have nothing to do with multi-head support.
				This can save a lot of head scratching
				later.</P
><P
>I'm going to concentrate my explanation on
				getting X running on the second monitor as
				doing most other configurations will just be a
				obvious subset of the procedure.</P

					it without any arguments you'll get the
					following usage message: "usage:
						con2fb fbdev
						console".</P
><P
>Thus, an example command would be
					"con2fb /dev/fb1
						/dev/tty6" to move
					virtual console number six over to the
					second monitor.  Use Ctrl-Alt-F6 to
					move over to that console and see that

					settings on the monitor you run the
					"fbset" command on.
					Therefore, you must be careful to use
					the "-fb" flag on the
					second monitor.  In particular, if you
					do nothing else you'll probably want to
					at least set the virtual vertical
					resolution to your actually vertical
					resolution.</P

				the name of the current VT and just make two
