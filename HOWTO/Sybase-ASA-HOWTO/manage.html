><P
>When you first create a database in Adaptive Server Anywhere,
the only tables it contains are the system tables. To create tables
to hold your data, use either the CREATE TABLE statement in SQL
or the Sybase Central Table Editor. You must have the DBA or RESOURCE
authority to create a table, and you must have the DBA authority
make another user its owner. </P
><P
>The CREATE TABLE statement has an extremely broad range of
options that are documented in the Adaptive Server Anywhere Reference,
so only a small subset of options are described here. The basic
syntax is as follows: </P
><TABLE

  (column-name datatype [, column-name datatype]...)</B
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>The "owner." portion before tablename is optional, and is
used by a user with the DBA authority to make another user the owner
of the new table. table-name and column-name, respectively, are
the names of the table and its columns. Insert the words PRIMARY
KEY after datatype to make it the primary key. </P
><P
>See the SQL Data Types chapter of the Adaptive Server Anywhere
Reference for a list of the types available and their characteristics. </P
><P
>To create a table named customer with columns id, name, address,
city_state_zip, and phone, with id as the primary key, for example,
use the following CREATE TABLE statement: </P

 ) </B
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>It's also important to add "not null" in the case of id, since
it's the primary key. </P
><P
>To create a table in Sybase Central, connect to your database
and open its Tables folder. If you double-click "Add Table," Sybase
Central Table Editor will be opened and using the button bar, you
can set up the table as you wish. Hover the mouse pointer over each
button to find out what it does. Don't forget to make a primary
key before you close the Table Editor! </P

Anywhere Reference but not here that you might be interested in
include automatic incrementation (often used on the primary key),
constraints, and foreign keys. </P

SYS and PUBLIC. The two user IDs created are DBA and dbo.</P
><P
>SYS is a user as well as a group, but no one can connect to
the database using the user ID SYS. SYS owns the system tables and
the system views, and only SYS can update the system tables.</P
><P
>PUBLIC is a member of the SYS group, and has only SELECT permissions
on most system tables and system views. Since new user IDs are,
by default, members of PUBLIC, you should revoke PUBLIC's membership
in SYS if you want new users to have no permissions by default.</P
><P
>The DBA user can directly modify any part of an Adaptive Server
Anywhere database except the system tables. This is why it's important
to change the default DBA password from "SQL." You should be cautious
when giving DBA authority to a user (see the DBA Authority section
below). If a user needs DBA authority, s/he should be given DBA
authority, rather than the DBA's password. </P

to just one portion of a table. The portion can be defined in terms
of rows or in terms of columns. For example, you may wish to prevent
a group of users from seeing the quantity column of the banana_supply
table, or you may wish to limit a user to see information on a particular
type of banana. </P
><P
>While views restrict access based on the data, procedures
and triggers restrict access based on the actions a user can take.
Procedures and triggers store SQL statements in a database for use by
all applications. They execute under the table permissions of the
associated table's owner, regardless of the permissions of the user
who either executes the procedure or fires the trigger. </P
><P
>Procedures are invoked by a CALL statement, and can take values
as well as return them. Unlike procedures, however, triggers are
can neither take values nor return them, and are invoked by insertions,
updates, or deletions in the table it is associated with. Permissions
are not associated with triggers. They execute when the action defined
to fire them is performed, regardless of the user.</P

that carry out specific tasks. This approach strictly defines the manner
