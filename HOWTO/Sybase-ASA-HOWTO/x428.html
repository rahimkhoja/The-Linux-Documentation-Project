>The maximum size of a database file depends on your file system
and the page size you choose. Database files are limited to 256
million database pages or the filesize limit, whichever is reached
first. UNIX files can be as large as 1 Tb, in some cases-see the
Physical Limitations chapter of the Adaptive Server Anywhere Reference
Manual or your Linux documentation for more information. You can
set pages to be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 kb in size, but it is not
recommended that you use a page size of 1 kb. The default page size
is 2 kb. </P
><P
>By default, Adaptive Server Anywhere also creates a file called
the <EM
>transaction log</EM
>. Besides improving performance,
the transaction log is vital to Adaptive Server Anywhere replication
systems and database recovery in event of system failures. When possible,
it is recommended that the transaction log be placed on a physical
device (in most cases, a disk drive) separate from the main database
file, to reduce the chances of both the main database file and transaction
log being affected in the event of a media failure. You can specify
the name and location of the transaction log when you create the
database. </P

command prompt or in Interactive SQL. You can also create databases
through Sybase Central, if you prefer, by opening the Utilities

You aren't actually required to specify a database file when you
start up the database server, but if you don't, you must specify a
name for the server using the -n switch. By default, if you do not
specify a name for the database, it takes on the name of the database

to a Database chapter of the Adaptive Server Anywhere User's Guide.

Parameters chapter of the Adaptive Server Anywhere Reference. </P

>When Adaptive Server Anywhere utilities are looking for connection
parameters, they check the SQLCONNECT environment variable for any
parameters that were left out of the connection string. If you're
putting connection parameters into the SQLCONNECT environment variable,
replace the equal signs with number (#) signs. In bash you would
use the following command: </P

semicolons can be used to separate bash commands. You can also use
double quotes. </P
