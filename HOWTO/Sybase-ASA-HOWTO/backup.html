of any serious installation. Adaptive Server Anywhere includes utilities
to help minimize data loss in case your data becomes corrupt as
a result of media failure, power outage, or other failure. </P

>Backups of Adaptive Server Anywhere databases can be performed
through the dbbackup command line utility, SQL, or Sybase Central.
Both full backups and incremental backups can be performed, and
they can be performed either online or offline (that is, whether
the server is running or not, respectively). In addition, backups
can be performed both from the server side and from the client side.</P

>5.1.1. Full vs. Incremental Backups</A
></H3
><P
>A full backup makes copies of the main database file and the
transaction log file. While it's the most basic and essential type
of backup, it usually isn't practical to regularly perform full backups
of large databases. As a result, incremental backups are commonly
used. </P
><P
>An incremental backup makes a copy of the transaction log
alone. It takes place as part of a cycle that begins with a full
backup, which is then followed by a given number of incremental backups.
Since only the transaction log is copied, an incremental backup
uses less time and resources, making it particularly suited for
large databases. Keep in mind, though, that the more time you leave
between full backups, the greater the risk of losing data in the
event that one of the transaction logs becomes unusable. </P

>5.1.2. Online vs. Offline Backups</A
></H3
><P
>An online backup is performed without stopping the database
server. It provides a consistent snapshot of the database, even
as the database is modified. Online backups are useful for databases
with high availability requirements, but they won't complete until
all active transactions are complete. </P
><P
>In contrast, offline backups are performed once the database
server has been shut down. They're useful for when the database
can be taken down on a regular basis. You make offline backups simply
by copying the pertinent files to another location using the cp
command in a terminal window. </P
><P
>In either case, both full and incremental backups can be performed. </P

><P
>An online backup can be performed from a client using the <EM
>dbbackup</EM
> command
line utility. This is known as a client-side backup, and it puts
a backup of the database on the client machine. </P
><P
>An online backup can also be performed on the server by issuing
the BACKUP statement in SQL. Server-side backups are generally faster,
owing to the fact that client-side backups usually depend upon transport
across networks. </P
