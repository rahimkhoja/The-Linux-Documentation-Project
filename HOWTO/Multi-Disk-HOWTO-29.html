<P>The following section is the basic design used at work for a number of
Sun SPARC servers running Solaris 2.5.1 in an industrial development
environment. It serves a number of database and cad applications in
addition to the normal services such as mail.
<P>Simplicity is emphasized here so <CODE>/usr/lib</CODE> has not been split
off from <CODE>/usr</CODE>.
<P>This is the basic layout, planned for about 100 users.

<P>Due to specific requirements at this place it is at times necessary to
have large partitions available on a short notice. Therefore drive 0 is
given as many tasks as feasible, leaving a large <CODE>/local1</CODE>
partition.
<P>This setup has been in use for some time now and found satisfactorily.
<P>For a more general and balanced system it would be better to swap <CODE>/tmp</CODE>
and <CODE>/var/tmp</CODE> and then move <CODE>/var</CODE> to drive 1.
