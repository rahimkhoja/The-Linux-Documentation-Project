>Xaccess is a file which XDM reads to determine which X Terminals can login and access software running on the host machine.  An X Terminal sends a request to XDM which in turn runs an Xsetup script which sets up the login screen and displays the xlogin widget which handles authentication and on successful authentication sets up a session between client applications on a host machine and an X Terminal.</P

>4.5. Configuring the X Font Server</H2
><P
>The X Font Server (xfs) provides system fonts to X display servers.  It is the only way to provide anti-aliased fonts such as freetype to most X Terminals.</P
><P
>On most Linux systems, xfs is started from a script in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/init.d</TT
>, and/or on startup from one or more scripts, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rc.d/init.d</TT
> or in one of the run-level initialization scripts in /etc/rc[0-6].d.  The most important thing to verify is that the X Terminal and the X Host are broadcasting and listening on the same port.  Some X Terminals use the default xfs port, 7100, for other services, so xfs can be run on an unassigned port, such as 7102, in order to avoid a conflict.</P
><P
>On most systems, the configuration for XFS is in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/fs/config</TT
>.  In order to enable XFS to be accessed remotely, comment out the no-listen = tcp directive from the configuration file.  Be sure to set a max client limit equal to or greater than the total number of clients you will be serving.</P

><P
>The Xsession file controls much of the information regarding a particular host machines X environment.  Examples of things that might be set in this file includes logging, which desktop manager to run, and which keyboard mappings to use.  
These settings are highly environment specific, and for that reason will not be addressed in this document.  Suffice to say that you will want to decide whether to use user-level or global preferences for the desktop environment and that those configuration changes must be made in this file and in a .xsession file in the user's home directory.&#13;</P
