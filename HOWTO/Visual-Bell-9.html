<P>The bad news is that not every application uses <CODE>termcap</CODE> or
<CODE>terminfo</CODE>. Most small programs feature 'backslash-a' (alarm)
characters in the C source code.  The "alarm" code becomes a literal
ASCII BEL in the strings as stored in the executable binary.  Real
application don't usually fall in this category, but be careful of C
newcomers who give you their own programs. Students of computer science
are the worst of all, granted.
<P>The only way to make these programs silent applications is
spekearectomy, or using the escape sequences by Martin Mares.
