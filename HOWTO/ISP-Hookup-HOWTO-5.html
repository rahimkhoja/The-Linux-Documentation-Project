</H2>

<P>
<!--

 As long as PPP is active, it will be
possible to read news <B>online</B>.  There are lots
of available programs, two simple alternatives being

 rtin and 
<!--

trn.
<P>To start reading news, the only thing required in terms of
configuration in most cases is to set NNTPSERVER
(usually once and for all in the file 
<!--
.profile
-->

.profile):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
export NNTPSERVER=news.acme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To get the <I>From</I>-address correct in postings, some
programs <I>may</I> require:

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 How do I set up an offline news-reader?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
news-reader
-->
 To be able to read news while
offline and thus reduce phone bills and give greater
flexibility, one must set up a local news-spool of one
sort or the other.  This requires some configuration, and there
will also be a certain amount of disk space involved.  After
initial setup, things should run more or less by themselves, with
only some attention needed from time to time.
<P>Two different solutions will be described here.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 How do I set up C News?</A>
</H2>

<P>The solution described here is based on the news-server
<B>C News</B> and the NNTP protocol.
C News was originally targeted towards another sort of
configuration, but is flexible enough to handle our situation
too.  One might also use the more recent <B>INN</B>
news server but it might require a bit more in terms
of resources. Either way, be careful <B>not</B> to install
both; they don't live together easily.
<P>It is crucial that all maintenance of news is done while logged
in as user <CODE>news</CODE>, and that all configuration
files is placed in 
<!--
/usr/lib/news
-->

/usr/lib/news.  One way of handling this is, while
logged in as <CODE>root</CODE> to write <CODE>su news;
cd</CODE>.
<P>The most important files in the configuration are:
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> 
<!--
active
-->
 active is an overview
over active newsgroups.  It is updated as required by the command
<!--
addgroup
-->
 addgroup, e.g.  <CODE>addgroup
comp.os.linux.networking y</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> 
<!--
organization
-->
 organization should
simply contain whatever you want in the <I>Organization:</I>
header field, in our case:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> 
<!--
mailname
-->
 mailname should in our
case be set to <CODE>acme.xz</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> 
<!--
whoami
-->
 whoami is set to the name
of your <CODE>site</CODE> in the Path: thread.
In a setup as described here, using 
<!--
newsx
-->

newsx, this name will never leave the machine, so
you can set this to whatever you like as long as you are pretty
sure it is unique. In this case <CODE>roderick</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> The file 
<!--
sys
-->
 sys controls
fetching and further distribution of news.  We will assume the
ISP in our case adds <CODE>acme.xz</CODE> to the Path, and that this
is the only news source we have.  The example given really tells
that we will accept everything that arrives, and that we will
only post news to <CODE>acme.xz</CODE> that it hasn't seen before,
and is originally posted at our own site.  In this simplified
setup we assume that the all groups will come from a single
source.  <CODE>/all</CODE> specifies the distribution, and
<B>must</B> be included.  The letter <CODE>F</CODE> says
that (pointers to) outgoing news articles will be collected in a
file.</LI>
</UL>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> A subdirectory for the outgoing news must be created, in
our case:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mkdir /var/spool/news/out.going/acme
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
<UL>
<LI> 
<!--
mailpaths
-->
 mailpaths controls
posting in moderated groups, although this task may usually be
left to the ISP.</LI>
</UL>
<P>C News needs a certain degree of daily maintenance, but this can
be specified once and for all via the command <CODE>crontab -e</CODE>
<!--
crontab
-->
 issued as user <CODE>news</CODE>.  A suggested
setup follows; it can be tuned as required:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# maintain incoming and outgoing batches
10,40 *  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsrun

# expire C News, once a day
30 0  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/expire/doexpire

# monitor and report if needed
00 2  * * sat /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/addmissing
40 3  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/newswatch
50 3  * * * /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/newsdaily
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
newsrun
-->
 newsrun moves articles in and
out (twice every hour), 
<!--
doexpire
-->

doexpire will delete articles as they get old (every
night at 00:30), and the three last commands does various
supervisory and error correcting tasks.
<P>One should also ensure that things are cleaned up when starting
the machine. As user root, add the following line to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
su news -c /usr/lib/newsbin/maint/newsboot
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

News may be collected via the program <B>NewsX</B>,
<!--
NewsX
-->
 picking news from an NNTP-server
The program can be found at:
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/transport/newsx-0.9.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/news/transport/newsx-0.9.tar.gz</A></CODE>
Or:
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/newsx-0.9.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.sol.no/user/egilk/newsx-0.9.tar.gz</A></CODE>
<P>Setting up <CODE>NewsX</CODE> is quite simple.
Installation is a classic case of:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make
su
make install
exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With the setup outlined here, all you have to do is to create the
groups you want to read using the 
<!--
addgroup
-->

addgroup command.
<P>To fetch articles, user <CODE>news</CODE> issues the
following commands (assuming communication via PPP or similar is
up):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
newsrun
newsx acme news.acme.xz
newsrun
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
newsrun
-->
<P>The option <CODE>-d</CODE> gives continuous printout to the screen.
Refer to the NewsX documentation for further information.
<P>NewsX will also take care of posting of outgoing news.
<P>To control disposal of articles as they get old, a file
<CODE>explist</CODE> is required.  The comments in this
example should explain what we want to do:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# hold onto history lines 14 days, nobody gets &gt;120 days
/expired/                       x       14      -
/bounds/                        x       0-1-120 -

# retain these for 2 months
comp.sources,comp.os.linux.all  x       60      -

# noise gets thrown away fast
junk,control                    x       2       -

# default:  14 days, no archive
all                             x       14      -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>ALT:</B> In a small news-spool, one will usually not need
the newsgroup <CODE>control</CODE>.  The traffic is <B>huge</B>
compared to the possible usefulness. The main point is that
articles will be canceled, and that groups may be created
automatically. To ensure that control messages containing
<CODE>newgroup</CODE> not shall mess up things for us, a file called
<!--
newgroupperm
-->
 newgroupperm specifies
what we will allow:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
comp.os.linux   tale@uunet.com  yv
all             any             nq
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In this example, all proper groups under comp.os.linux will be
created (y), and the user <CODE>news</CODE> will be notified (v).
Everything else will be silently (q) ignored (n).  The last line
is sufficient if you want to create all groups manually.
<P><B>ALT:</B> An alternative to NewsX is suck.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 How do I set up Leafnode?</A>
</H2>

<P>A different solution altogether is to install the integrated
package 
<!--
leafnode
-->
 leafnode.  This will
handle all tasks required for a personal news spool, and is easy
to configure.  It is available via:
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.troll.no/freebies/leafnode.html">http://www.troll.no/freebies/leafnode.html</A></CODE>
<P>As for C News, all news maintenance really should be performed as
user <CODE>news</CODE>.
<P>The home directory for leafnode is in
/usr/lib/leafnode.  To install, write:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/lib/leafnode
tar -xzvf leafnode-0.8.tgz
cd leafnode-0.8
make
su
make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note in the following that the prefix
/usr/local/sbin should be replaced with
/usr/sbin if you installed leafnode from a package.
<P>While still being logged in as <CODE>root</CODE>, change the line
that controls NNTP in 
<!--
/etc/inetd.conf
-->

/etc/inetd.conf:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
nntp  stream  tcp  nowait  news  /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/leafnode
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Activate it by:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
killall -HUP inetd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Return to user <CODE>news</CODE> by writing exit.  In
<!--
/usr/lib/leafnode/config
-->

/usr/lib/leafnode/config change the line that
defines the NNTP server. In our case:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
server = news.acme.xz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Leafnode will look after itself by adding the following command
via <CODE>crontab -e</CODE> as user <CODE>news</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# expire Leafnode, once a day
0 4 * * * /usr/local/sbin/texpire
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
texpire
-->
<P>News exchange is also done as user <CODE>news</CODE> by the following
command (assuming PPP is up and running):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/usr/local/sbin/fetch
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--
fetch
-->
<P>Users who wants to read news should then use the recipe in
<I>How do I set up an online news-reader?</I>, except that they
configure for the local machine, i.e:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
export NNTPSERVER=localhost
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That should be all there is to it.  The first
<CODE>fetch</CODE> will transfer a list of available
newsgroups.  Leafnode will then monitor what groups the users are
requesting, and adapt to this the <B>next</B> time it is
activated.
<P>Note that leafnode does not seems to work in cases where NNTP
authorization is required.  +.LP
<P><B>ALT:</B> An alternative to leafnode is
nntpcache, available from:
<P><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.suburbia.net/pub/nntpcache/nntpcache.tgz">ftp://ftp.suburbia.net/pub/nntpcache/nntpcache.tgz</A></CODE>
<B>ALT:</B> Another alternative is to use the newsreader
<!--
slrn
-->
 slrn together with the 
<!--
slrn-
pull
-->
 slrn-pull package. The newsreader must
be compiled with the <CODE>spool</CODE> feature set.
