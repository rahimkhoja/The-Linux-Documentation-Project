<P>There is not *the* newsreader for Linux, like there is not *the*
editor. My favourite newsreader is emacs in gnus mode which is the
most configurable reader for Linux. Many people are using slrn and
tin on a terminal, many people use knews under X. There are also trn,
nn and a lot more reader, so just try what you like. The only reader
you shouldn't use is Netscape, it is big, feature-less, unstable, and
it creates sometimes broken postings. However, it is your personal
decision.
<P>Anyway, knews is no bad idea for your first experiences as it is very
user-friendly and easy to understand.
