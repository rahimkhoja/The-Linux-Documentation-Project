>7. Life With Multiple Users</H1
><P
>&#13;Having everybody using a common machine gives your users far more
opportunity to get in each other's hair. Even though Unix (and therefore
Linux) was designed from the bottom up as a multi-user system, there are
only so many resources available, and having one user hogging them will
annoy everybody. And they will all come to you and say it is your fault.

>7.1. Shared Resources</H2
><P
>&#13;One of your biggest headaches will probably be <STRONG
>CD-ROMs</STRONG
> and
<STRONG
>CD-R/Ws</STRONG
>. In theory, they belong on the mock mainframe like everything
else, but this creates lots of problems. Your users need to be able to
physically get to the machine to put the CDs in, which might not be a good
idea from the security point of view. Once the CD is in the drive, you can
get various people trying to mount, unmount or eject it, and getting upset
if they can't. Reading a CD (for example with <TT
CLASS="literal"
>cdparanoia</TT
>) can interfere
with multimedia programs and cause sound tracks to skip.  Writing CDs is
even worse because it requires the system to pay attention for a certain
uninterrupted amount of time. If you only have one processor on the machine
and other users decide to do something intensive while the burn is going
on, the write might fail, and somebody is going to be really upset, because
he just lost a blank CD.
</P
><P
>&#13;One thing you can do is to move the CD-R/W onto a dedicated support machine (the
<STRONG
>Burner</STRONG
>) that does nothing else. Such a machine can be set up with Jörg P. M. Haeger's
<A
HREF="http://joerghaeger.de/webCDwriter/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://joerghaeger.de/webCDwriter webCDwriter</A
>. It has a graphical interface written in Java and runs under any operating system with a Java Virtual Machine. This preserves the principle of encapsulation. Make sure there is nothing else on the Burner that you can't afford to use if the system is compromised. There are of course other, more primitive ways: You could export the user's home directory by NFS, which is, however, exactly the sort of thing we are trying to avoid. Or have the user create an image of the CD as an ISO file, and then let him send it to the support machine via <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sftp</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="literal"
>scp</TT
>. Then the user can walk
over to the machine and burn it by hand.
</P
><P
>&#13;In a family setting, none of this might be a problem. For a larger
configuration, with untrusted users, it could be a big problem. You might
end up telling everybody that they can't burn CDs on this system, period.
</P
><P
>&#13;Other resources are less of a problem. Traditionally, you used a <STRONG
>quota</STRONG
>
setting to limit the amount of disk space any single user could use. With
hard disks becoming less expensive by the month, this is not much of a
problem anymore, but depending on your user base, you might consider
installing very large quotas just to be safe. Users, however, are easily
upset by the very idea of quotas, especially if they hit their limit while
most of the harddisk is still free.

>7.2. Screen Savers and Other Gimmicks</H2
><P
>&#13;The original aim of screen savers was to keep whatever was being displayed
on the screen from burning itself into the monitor's phosphorous coating
while you were off to the water cooler. Soon, however, clever, cute, and
intricate screen savers became an end in themselves. Today's screen savers
have become so resource-hungry that some actually require you to have
certain types of hardware (like OpenGL support) before they will run.
</P
><P
>&#13;If you have a mock mainframe with X Windows, you can be sure that every
single one of your users will have a screen saver setup that will test the
system to its limits (just for fun, log into every terminal attached to the
mainframe once you have set everything up, and let each one run a different
screen saver. Watch the system load while you do this. Try not to whimper
too loudly). To make matters worse, some desktops like KDE let the user set
the screen saver's priority. The idea is that the user can set a low
priority, but in reality, they increase the priority until their jumping
OpenGL balls don't jerk anymore.
</P
><P
>&#13;Users consider playing around with their screen savers one of their basic
computer rights, so just blocking everything except the "blank screen" mode
can lead to people showing up in your office with pitchforks and torches.
One way around this is to put a <EM
>wrapper</EM
> around the screen saver that
makes sure the priority is set low. For example, if your setup uses the
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>xlock</TT
> command as a screen saver, you can move it to <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xlock.real</TT
> and then
create a shell script named <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xlock</TT
>:

>&#13;This is a very crude script, but you get the point. This lets your users
keep their beloved screen savers but makes sure that the performance hit
won't be deadly to the whole system.

>7.3. Idle Terminals</H2
><P
>&#13;Another annoying habit users have is to walk away from their terminals
while they are still logged in. KDE and Gnome have a "Lock Screen" button
right next to their "Logout" button, but you might have problems getting
your users to use it, at least until the first person finds that somebody
has had fun with his email account.
</P
><P
>&#13;One way to deal with this is to have the system shut down abandoned
terminals with the idle daemon, which should be included
in your distribution. Use this with care: If you force a user off the
system when he still has some half-written letter on his screen, he isn't
going to like it. The program <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xautolock</TT
> can be set up to invoke a screen saver or a different program after an X session has been idle for a configured amount of time.
