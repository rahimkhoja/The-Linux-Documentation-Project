>1.6. Future Versions</H2
><P
>&#13;At some point in 2004, my wife and I realized that we were spending so much time
on the road that it made more sense to move all our stuff to laptops. The
home network has been restructured accordingly. In other words, the
maintainer of the Mock Mainframe HOWTO isn't using a mock mainframe
anymore, which means I am looking for somebody who is to take over this document. Volunteers are welcome to email me at the address given above.
