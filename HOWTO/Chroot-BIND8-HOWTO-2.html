<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Preparing the Jail</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Creating a User</A>
</H2>

<P>As mentioned in the introduction, it's not a good idea to run BIND as root.  So,
before we begin, let's create a separate user for BIND.  Note that you should
never use an existing generic user like <CODE>nobody</CODE> for this purpose.
However, some distributions, such as SuSE and Linux Mandrake have started
providing a specific user (generally called <CODE>named</CODE>); you can simply adapt
this user for our purposes, if you like.
<P>This requires adding a line something like the following to <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
named:x:200:200:Nameserver:/chroot/named:/bin/false
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

And one like this to <CODE>/etc/group</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
named:x:200:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This creates a user and group called <CODE>named</CODE> for BIND.  Make sure that the
UID and GID (both 200 in this example) are unique on your system.  The shell is
set to <CODE>/bin/false</CODE> because this user will never need to log in.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Directory Structure</A>
</H2>

<P>Now, we must set up the directory structure that we will use for the chroot jail
in which BIND will live.  This can be anywhere on your filesystem; the truly
paranoid may even want to put it on a separate volume.  I shall assume that you
will use <CODE>/chroot/named</CODE>.  Let's start by creating the following directory
structure:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/chroot
  +-- named
       +-- bin
       +-- dev
       +-- etc
       |    +-- namedb
       +-- lib
       +-- var
            +-- run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Placing the BIND Data</A>
</H2>

<P>Assuming that you have already done a conventional installation of BIND and are
using it, you will already have an existing <CODE>named.conf</CODE> and zone files.
These files must now be moved (or copied, to be safe) into the chroot jail, so
that BIND can get at them.  <CODE>named.conf</CODE> goes in <CODE>/chroot/named/etc</CODE>,
and the zone files can go in <CODE>/chroot/named/etc/namedb</CODE>.  For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp -p /etc/named.conf /chroot/named/etc/

# cp -a /var/named/* /chroot/named/etc/namedb/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>BIND will likely need to write to the <CODE>namedb</CODE> directory, and probably some
of the files in it.  For example, if your DNS serves as a slave for a zone, it
will have to update that zone file.  Also, BIND can dump statistical
information, and does so in this directory.  For that reason, you should
probably make the <CODE>named</CODE> user the owner of this directory and its contents:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chown -R named:named /chroot/named/etc/namedb
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

BIND will also need to write to the <CODE>/var/run</CODE> directory, to put its
pidfile and ndc socket there, so let's allow it to do so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chown named:named /chroot/named/var/run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 System Support Files</A>
</H2>

<P>Once BIND is running in the chroot jail, it will not be able to access files
outside the jail <B>at all</B>.  However, it needs to access a few key files, such
as the system's C library.  Exactly what libraries are required will depend on
your flavour of UNIX.  For most modern Linux systems, the following commands
will be sufficient to put the necessary libraries in place:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /chroot/named/lib
# cp -p /lib/libc-2.*.so .
# ln -s libc-2.*.so libc.so.6
# cp -p /lib/ld-2.*.so .
# ln -s ld-2.*.so ld-linux.so.2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

As an alternative, you could simply build statically-linked versions of the BIND
binaries to put in your chroot jail.  You should also copy <CODE>ldconfig</CODE> into
the jail, and run it to create an <CODE>etc/ld.so.cache</CODE> for the jail environment.
The following commands could take care of this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp /sbin/ldconfig /chroot/named/bin/
# chroot /chroot/named /bin/ldconfig -v
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>BIND needs one more system file in its jail:  good ol' <CODE>/dev/null</CODE>.  Again,
the exact command necessary to create this device node may vary from system to
system; check your <CODE>/dev/MAKEDEV</CODE> script to be sure.  Some systems may also
require <CODE>/dev/zero</CODE>.  For most Linux systems, we can use the following
command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mknod /chroot/named/dev/null c 1 3
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finally, you need a couple extra files in the <CODE>/etc</CODE> directory inside the
jail.  In particular, you must copy <CODE>/etc/localtime</CODE> (this sometimes known
as <CODE>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</CODE> on some systems) in there so that BIND
logs things with the right time on them, and you must make a simple <CODE>group</CODE>
file with the <CODE>named</CODE> group in it.  The following two commands will take
care of this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp /etc/localtime /chroot/named/etc/

# echo 'named:x:200:' > /chroot/named/etc/group
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Keep in mind that the GID, 200 in this example, must match the one you defined
in the real <CODE>/etc/group</CODE> above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="logging"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Logging</A>
</H2>

<P>Unlike a conventional jailbird, BIND can't just scribble its log entries on the
walls :-).  Normally, BIND logs through <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, the system logging daemon.
However, this type of logging is performed by sending the log entries to the
special socket <CODE>/dev/log</CODE>.  Since this is outside the jail, BIND can't use
it any more.  Fortuantely, there are a couple options to work around this.
<P>
<H3>The Ideal Solution</H3>

<P>The ideal solution to this dilemma requires a reasonably recent version of
<CODE>syslogd</CODE> which supports the <CODE>-a</CODE> switch introduced by OpenBSD.
Check the manpage for your <CODE>syslogd(8)</CODE> to see if you have such a
version.
<P>If you do, all you have to do is add the switch ``<CODE>-a
/chroot/named/dev/log</CODE>'' to the command line when you launch <CODE>syslogd</CODE>.
On systems which use a full SysV-init (which includes most Linux distributions),
this is typically done in the file <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog</CODE>.  For example,
on my Red Hat Linux system, I changed the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
daemon syslogd -m 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
daemon syslogd -m 0 -a /chroot/named/dev/log
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On Caldera OpenLinux systems, they use a daemon launcher called <CODE>ssd</CODE>,
which reads configuration from <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/daemons/syslog</CODE>.  You
simply need to modify the options line to look like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
OPTIONS_SYSLOGD="-m 0 -a /chroot/named/dev/log"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similarly, on SuSE systems, I'm told that the best place to add this switch
is in the <CODE>/etc/rc.config</CODE> file.  Changing the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SYSLOGD_PARAMS=""
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to read
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SYSLOGD_PARAMS="-a /chroot/named/dev/log"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

should do the trick.
<P>Once you've figured out how to make this change for your system, simply
restart <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, either by killing it and launching it again (with
the extra parameters), or by using the SysV-init script to do it for you:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog stop
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog start
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once it's been restarted, you should see a ``file'' in <CODE>/chroot/named/dev</CODE>
called <CODE>log</CODE>, that looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
srw-rw-rw-   1 root     root            0 Mar 13 20:58 log
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>The Other Solutions</H3>

<P>If you have an older <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, then you'll have to find another way to do
your logging.  There are a couple programs out there, such as <CODE>holelogd</CODE>,
which are designed to help by acting as a ``proxy'' and accepting log entries
from the chrooted BIND and passing them out to the regular <CODE>/dev/log</CODE>
socket.
<P>Alteratively, you can simply configure BIND to log to files instead of going
through syslog.  See the BIND documentation for more details if you choose to go
this route.
