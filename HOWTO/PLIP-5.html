<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Setting up the configuration files. </A></H2>

<P><B>NOTE</B>: Some distributions, like Debian, use different config files. 
If you have a standard installation and you don't find the rc.inet* files, look
for (different) config files in the /etc/init.d directory.
<P>First of all remember to backup all the files you will change, 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#cp rc.inet1 rc.inet1.BACKUP 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>may be a good idea.
<P>Now, if you don't have it done already, you must choose the IP addresses
of the two machines. In my examples I'll use a couple of example IPs for
the IPs that you'll write, in the standard xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx format.
<P>In the /etc/rc.d/inet1.rc file of both the machines add this (better if in 
the last part of the file):
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
/sbin/route add -net ${NETWORK} netmask ${NETMASK}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Where NETWORK and NETMASK should be set up previously. If you don't know how
to do it, please read the NET-2-HOWTO. 
<P>If after this route command you get a message like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SIOCADDRT: network unreachable
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>then use this instead: 
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
/sbin/route add -net ${NETWORK} netmask ${NETMASK} dev plip1  
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>where, as usually, you'll have to use the interface name reported by
the kernel messages (see above).
<P>You may safely ignore these variables only in the following case:
<P>If you only want to connect two machines on a standalone network, you may 
pick-up any IP address, say 200.0.0.1 and 200.0.0.2 respectively.
In this case you can safely put NETWORK="200.0.0.0" and NETMASK="255.255.255
.0". These are the example IPs that I use in my Quick PLIP Installation (see
below).
<P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: 200.0.0.1 and 200.0.0.2 are only example IPs, I advice not to 
use these numbers definitively because they could be the addresses of real
hosts on Internet! 
<P>I strongly advice to choose your address between the "private address"
intervals:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
          172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
          192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the file /etc/hosts of both the machines you should add the entries with
the IP of the machines that you connect via PLIP. In my example, the entries
are:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
200.0.0.1       one             # this is the "one" IP address
200.0.0.2       two             # this is the "two" IP address
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Where one and two are the names you have chosen for the two hosts.
<P>If you want to activate the NFS, beside answering yes during the kernel
configuration, you must add in /etc/exports the entries that describe the
directories that you wish to export. In my example, to be able to mount
the directory /usr, you should add this entry:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
 /usr                          two (ro)
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>For more informations about NFS, please read the specific documentation;
don't report me problems with the NFS, I won't be able to help.
<P>Now reboot your system.
<P>
