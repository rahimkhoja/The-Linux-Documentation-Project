</H2>

<P>Yesterday (8/28/2003), I tried to boot with a Knoppix cd (3.2) and found out that the computer froze during the SCSI probes.<BR>
I encountered the same problem with a more recent version (3.3).
<P>Here is a quick way to prevent this:
<P>When you get the knoppix prompt, add noscsi and your lang settings and press enter:

boot: knoppix noscsi lang=fr

<P>lang=fr is only to ensure that my language will be used even though I overrode the append line.

<P>
<P>I recently found out several important hardware flaws on this mainboard.
For example I could not get PLIP to work properly, if anyone has, let me know!
I used a grey laplink parallel cable (also known as Null Printer Cable)  a friend sold me and followed the 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PLIP.html">PLIP Howto</A>. I could watch activity on the pins using a dos tool, but nothing went through, it even gave a warning:
<P><EM>modprobe plip</EM>
<P><EM>tail /var/log/messages</EM>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kernel: plip: parport0 has no IRQ. Using IRQ-less mode,which is fairly inefficient!
kernel: NET3 PLIP version 2.4-parport pj.oc.irm@ebiing
kernel: plip0: Parallel port at 0x378, not using IRQ.

<P>Karl said:
<P><I>"I've found there is only one parallel port mode which actually assigns
an IRQ in real life (the bios believes differently) I think its EPP but
i could be wrong. I haven't used PLIP before but i thought that this may
help a little."</I>
<P>I still get the same warning, let me know if it ever worked.
<P>So I had to go on with floppies, since the box didn't have a cdrom drive, and there, I found out that the 486 had a much faster writing speed, more than 10 seconds of difference writing exactly the same image to the the same floppy...

I have now (with kernel 2.4.27, see below):

Jan 31 10:51:47 galicja kernel: i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc0=
0, MEM 0x0000 and 0x0000, IRQ 11
[...]
Jan 31 10:51:47 galicja kernel: ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: CMI65 (CMedia)

Earlier it was

Nov 23 06:42:36 galicja kernel: i810: SiS 7012 found at IO 0xd800 and 0xdc0=
0, MEM 0x0000 and 0x0000, IRQ 11
[...]
Nov 23 06:42:36 galicja kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: ALC38(Unk=

I just upgraded the kernel to 2.4.27 and situation is now worse: I
have no sound in xawtv, too.

<P>If you have a similar situation, please have a look at the Alsa drivers.

# For this family of chips the negative voltage equation is different from

# tied to a positive reference voltage.  See ITE8705/12 datasheet (SIS950
# data sheet is wrong)
# Vs = (1 + Rin/Rf) * Vin - (Rin/Rf) * Vref.
# Vref = 4.096 volts, Vin is voltage measured, Vs is actual voltage.

# The next two are negative voltages (-12 and -5).
# The following formulas must be used. Unfortunately the datasheet
# does not give recommendations for Rin, Rf, but we can back into
# them based on a nominal +2V input to the chip, together with a 4.096V
Vref.
# Formula:
#    actual V = (Vmeasured * (1 + Rin/Rf)) - (Vref * (Rin/Rf))
#    For -12V input use Rin/Rf = 6.68

</H2>

<H3>Alvaro</H3>

<P>Using a modified BIOS, I was able to successfully overclock my Athlon 1000Mhz
to 1050Mhz flawlessy, but
when I messed with hdparm (30Gig Western Digital hard drive) using <EM>hdparm
-c1 -X66 /dev/hda</EM>, I managed to corrupt my filesystem, so beware.
<P>
<P>If you are a real tweaker, you might want to change your BIOS Logo and stuff,
some people tried that and it worked OK, some others
not, so they had to flash their BIOS again (blindly with a bootdisk and a
working bios in it) to make the board work again. It is really up
to you. Search Google or OC Workbench and you'll be on your way.
<P>
<P>Good Luck! :-)
<H3>Karl</H3>

<P><I>"Also i recommend you try using either the HoneyX bios or the CHEEPOman
bios for the k7s5a instead of the official release, it gives you more
control although some problems with non-atapi CD drives (my dvd goes
crazy in linux with cheepoman)</I> 
<P><I>The cheepoman bios also fixes several issues which ECS has still not
attended to.</I>
<P><I>These bios roms are unsupported by ECS please bare that in mind, also
they are meant for overclocking more than anything else, overclocking in
such a way as you don't need a pencil ;)"</I>
