>Piercing the firewall is not everything.
You must also route the packets
from the client side of the firewall to the server side.
This section tackles the basic settings specific
about routing accross a tunnel.
For more detailed explanations of routing,
see the relevant HOWTOs and man pages
about networking, routing and masquerading.</P

>6.1. The catch</A
></H2
><P
>The catch is that although your network administration would tell you
to setup your some router on your client side's as the default route,
(this may be relevant if you want to have a specific route
to the networks on the client of the firewall),
you should setup PPP link as the route to the networks on the server side.</P
><P
>In other words, your default route should point to a router
on whichever side of the tunnel that gives you access to the Internet.</P
><P
>Most importantly, packets sent to the server host as part of running the tunnel
should be routed through your usual network
(e.g. your default ethernet router);
otherwise, your kernel will have problems,
as it tries to route through the inside the tunnel
the very packets that ought to constitute the outside of the tunnel.</P
><P
>Thus, you'll have to setup correct routes
in your network startup configuration.
The precise location of your routing configuration data
depends on your distribution, but it is typically
under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/init.d/network</TT
>
or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/network/</TT
>;
similarly, your PPP configuration is typically
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp/</TT
>,
and the proper place to configure its routes is usually
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ip-up</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ip-up.d/</TT
>.
(Tip: to identify your distribution-specific file locations,
you must read the documentation of your distribution and otherwise
<A
HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?RTFM"
TARGET="_top"
>RTFM</A
>;
alternatively use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>grep</B
> recursively
on your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
>;
at worst, trace what happens at boot time,
as configured in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/inittab</TT
>.)</P
><P
>When piercing a tunnel from a roaming laptop on the Internet
into a protected network, the script <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>getroute.pl</B
>
(available from the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
> distribution)
gives the current route to the server host that is the other end of the tunnel.</P
><P
>Once you can route packets to the server side of the tunnel,
you might want to setup your machine as a router for all your pals
on the client side of the firewall, achieving a full-fledged shared VPN.
This is not specific to Firewall-Piercing, so just you read
the relevant HOWTOs about networking, routing and masquerading.
Also, for security reasons, be sure to also setup
a proper firewall on your machine,
especially if you're going to be a router for other people.</P
><P
>Finally, be reminded that if you're using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>
on the server end of the tunnel
(as opposed to user-mode <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slirp</B
>),
you will have to configure proper routes and firewall rules
on the server side of the tunnel, too.</P

>6.2. Example of routing</A
></H2
><P
>In this example, your client machine is connected to a firewalled LAN
through ethernet device <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0</TT
>.
Its IP address is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.34.56.78</TT
>;
its network is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.34.56.0/24</TT
>;
its router is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.34.56.1</TT
>.</P
><P
>Your network administrator may have told you
to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.34.56.1</TT
>
as default router, but you shouldn't.
You should only use it as a route to the client side of the firewall.</P
><P
>Let's suppose the client side of your firewall is made of networks
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.34.0.0/16</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12.13.0.0/16</TT
>,
and of host <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>11.22.33.44</TT
>.
To make them accessible through your client router,
add these routes to your global network startup script:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>route add -net 12.34.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 12.34.56.1
route add -net 12.13.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 12.34.56.1
route add -host 11.22.33.44 gw 12.34.56.1</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
You must also keep the route to the client's local network,
necessary for linux kernel 2.0 and earlier,
but but unnecessary for linux kernel 2.2 and later
(that implicitly adds it during the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifconfig</B
>):
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>route add -net 12.34.56.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
On the other hand, you <EM
>must</EM
> remove
any default route from your scripts.
Delete or comment away a line like:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>route add default gw 12.34.56.1</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Note that it is also possible to remove the route from the running
kernel configuration without rebooting, by the following command:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>route del default gw 12.34.56.1</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Then you can have <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> setup a default route automatically
when it starts by using its <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>defaultroute</B
> option.
Alternatively, you can add it afterwards:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>route add default gw 10.0.2.2</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
If you don't want <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> as a default route,
because the Internet access is available on your side of the firewall,
and if you instead want network <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>98.76.48.0/20</TT
>
to be routed through the tunnel,
except from host <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>98.76.54.32</TT
>
that serves as the other end of the tunnel,
then add the following lines to your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp/ip-up</TT
>:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>route add -host 98.76.54.32 gw 12.34.56.1
route add -net 98.76.48.0 netmask 255.255.240.0 gw 10.0.2.2</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
If you're a laptop and your current LAN moves,
and yet you want to keep your current route to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>98.76.54.32</TT
>,
whatever it be, then use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>getroute.pl</B
> as follows
to automatically find the right gateway
in the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>route add -host</B
> command:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>$(getroute.pl 98.76.54.32)</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Note that if you have them in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
>,
you might use symbolic names instead of numerical IP addresses
(and you might even use FQDN's, if you trust the DNS never to fail).</P
