>If all you can do is <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

(because of a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
> proxy),
then this solution might be fit for you.</P
><P
>The firewall-piercing program, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
>,
will use a "tty proxy", <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cotty</B
>,
that opens two pseudo-tty devices,
launches some command on each of those devices' slaves,
and stubbornly copies every character that one outputs
to the tty that serves as input of the other command.
One command will be telnet connection to server site,
and the other will be the client's <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> can then open and control the telnet session
with a chat script as usual.</P
><P
>Actually, if your telnet proxy allows connection to an arbitrary port,
and if you can reliably run a daemon on the server host
(with a cron job to relaunch it in case of breakage),
then you'd better write some program that will just connect
a client side port to the server side port through the proxy,
so you can use the above secure solution,
possibly using some variant of

(if you submit it to me, I'll gladly integrate such a solution
to the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
> distribution).</P
><P
>Note: if you must use the unsecure telnet-based solution,
be sure that nothing lies in your target account
that you want to keep secret or untampered,
since the password will be sent in clear text accross the Internet.
If you can control these things, a one-time-password system,
or an explicit cryptographic challenge system will enhance your security,
although it will make automated connection scripts much more complex.</P

security is all a matter of <EM

But of course, by Murphy's law, it will break for you.

><B
CLASS="COMMAND"

<TT

meant to be the same on both sides of the firewall.
Having several alternate configurations to choose from is sure possible
(for instance, <EM

and is left as an exercise to the reader.</P
><P
>To begin with, copy the appropriate section of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fwprc</B
>
(the previous to last) into a file named <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.fwprcrc</TT
>
in your home directory.
Then replace variable values with stuff that fits your configuration.
Finally, copy to the other host, and test.</P
><P
>Default behavior is to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B

and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slirp</B

To modify that, you can redefine the appropriate function
in your <TT

>.fwprcrc</TT
> with such a line as:

><P
>Note that <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SLiRP</SPAN
>
is safer than <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>,
and easier to have access to,
since it does not require being root on the server machine,
and needn't additional firewall configuration to prevent
connections from the outside world into the firewalled network.
The basic functionality in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SLiRP</SPAN
> works quite well,
but I haven't managed to get some advertised pluses to work
(like run-time controllability).
Of course, since it is free software,
feel free to hack the source
so as to actually implement or fix whichever feature you need.</P
