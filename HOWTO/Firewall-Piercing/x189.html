>Let's assume that your firewall administrator allows
transparent TCP connections to some port on some server machine
on the other side of the firewall
(be it the standard SSH port 22, or an alternate destination port,
like the HTTP port 80 or whatever),
or that you somehow managed to get some port in one side of the firewall
to get redirected to a port on the other side
(using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>httptunnel</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mailtunnel</B
>,
some tunnel over <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>, or whatelse).</P
><P
>Then, you can run an <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sshd</B
> on the server side port,
and connect to it with an <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> on the client side port.
On both sides of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> connection,
you run IP emulators ( <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>),
and there you have your VPN, Virtual Public Network,
that circumvents the stupid firewall limitations,
with the added bonus of being encrypted for privacy
(beware: the firewall administrator still knows the other end of the tunnel,
and whatever authentication information you might have sent before to run
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>).</P
><P
>The exact same technology can be used to build a VPN, Virtual Private Network,
whereby you securely join physical sites into a one logical network
without sacrificing security with respect to the transport network
between the sites.</P

>Below is a sample script for you to adapt to your needs.
It uses the array feature of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>zsh</B
>,
but you may easily adapt it to your favorite shell.
Use option <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-p</B
> for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
to try another port than port 22
(but then, be sure to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sshd</B
> on same port).</P
><P
>Note that the script supposes that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
can login without your having to interactively type your password
(indeed, it's controlling tty will be connected to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>,
so if it asks for a password, you lose).
This can be done either by ssh keys in your
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>&#732;/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
>
that either do not require a password,
or that you unlock using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-agent</B
>
or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-askpass</B
>.
See your SSH documentation.
Actually, you might also use a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>chat</B
> script
to enter your password,
but this is definitely <EM
>not</EM
> the Right Thing.</P
><P
>If you are not <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>root</B
> on the server end,
or simply if want to screen your client's network from outbound connections,
you can use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slirp</B
> instead of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>
as the server's PPP emulator.
Just uncomment the relevant line.</P

is the default setting for <B

which might or not fit your specific setup.
In any case, you should most likely be using some address in one
of the ranges reserved by RFC 1918 for private networks:
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>10.0.0.0/8</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>172.16.0.0/12</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>192.168.0.0/16</TT
>.
The firewall-protected LAN might already be using some of them,
and avoiding clashes is your responsibility.
For more customization, please read the appropriate documentation.</P
