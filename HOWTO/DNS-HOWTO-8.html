<P><B>Keeping it working.</B>
<P>
<P>There is one maintenance task you have to do on nameds, other than
keeping them running.  That's keeping the <CODE>root.hints</CODE> file
updated.  The easiest way is using <CODE>dig</CODE>. First run <CODE>dig</CODE> with
no arguments you will get the <CODE>root.hints</CODE> according to your own
server.  Then ask one of the listed root servers with <CODE>dig
@rootserver</CODE>.  You will note that the output looks terribly like a
<CODE>root.hints</CODE> file.  Save it to a file (<CODE>dig @e.root-servers.net
. ns &gt;root.hints.new</CODE>) and replace the old <CODE>root.hints</CODE> with it.
<P>
<P>Remember to reload named after replacing the cache file.
<P>
<P>Al Longyear sent me this script that can be run automatically to
update <CODE>root.hints</CODE>.  Install a crontab entry to run it once a
month and forget it.  The script assumes you have mail working and
that the mail-alias `hostmaster' is defined.  You must hack it to suit
your setup.

<P>
<P>Some of you might have picked up that the <CODE>root.hints</CODE> file is
also available by ftp from Internic.  Please don't use ftp to update
<CODE>root.hints</CODE>, the above method is much more friendly to the net,
and Internic.
