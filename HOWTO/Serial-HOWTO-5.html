</H2>

<P> Multiport serial cards install in slots in a PC on the ISA or PCI
bus.  They are also called "...  adapters" or "... boards".  Each such
card provides you with many serial ports.  Today they are commonly
used for the control of external devices (including automation for
both industry and the home).  They can connect to computer servers for
the purpose of monitoring/controlling the server from a remote
location.  They were once mainly used for connecting up many dumb
terminals and/or modems to serial ports.  Today, use of dumb terminals
has declined, and several modems (or digital modems) can now be built
into an internal card.  So multiport serial cards are not as
significant as they once were.</P>
<P>Each multiport card has a number of external connecters (DB-25 or
RJ45) so that one may connect up a number of devices (modems,
terminals, etc.).  Each such physical device would then be connected
to its own serial port.  Since the space on the external-facing part
of the card is limited there is often not enough room for all the
serial port connectors.  To solve this problem, the connectors may be
on the ends of cables which come out (externally) from the card
(octopus cable).  Or they may be on an external box (possibly rack
mountable) which is connected by a cable to a multiport card.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.2">Dumb vs. Smart Cards</A>
</H2>

<P>Dumb multiport cards are not too much different than ordinary serial
ports.  They are interrupt driven and the CPU of the computer does
most all the work servicing them.  They usually have a system of
sharing a single interrupt for all the ports.  This doesn't decrease
the load on the CPU since the single interrupt will be sent to the CPU
each time any one port needs servicing.  Such devices usually require
special drivers that you must either compile into the kernel or use as
a module.</P>
<P>Smart boards may use ordinary UARTs but handle most interrupts from
the UARTs internally within the board.  This frees the CPU from the
burden of handling  all these interrupts.  The board may save up bytes
in its large internal FIFOs and transfer perhaps 1k bytes at a time to
the serial buffer in main memory.  It may use the full bus width of 32
bits for making data transfers to main memory (instead of transferring
only 8-bit bytes like dumb serial cards do).  Not all "smart" boards
are equally efficient.  Many boards today are Plug-and-Play.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.3">Getting/Enabling a Driver</A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>For a multiport board to work, a special driver for it must be used.
This driver may either be built into the kernel source code or
supplied as a module.  For the 2.6 kernels on, most drivers are
supplied both ways: as a module or it can be built into the kernel.
Take care not to both build support into the kernel and force the
module to load for a certain serial card.  For older kernels, there
were often no modules for dumb serial multiport boards so support was
built into the kernel.</P>

<H3>Build (compile) support into the kernel?</H3>

<P>A pre-compiled kernel may not have a driver for your multiport card
built in.  So then you must either compile the kernel yourself and
build in the right driver, or insure that the module is available and
loads.  Of course if the driver doesn't come both ways (as a
compile-time option and as a module) you have no such choice.</P>
<P>If you want to see what has already been compiled into an existing
working kernel, go the the /boot directory (or wherever the compiled
kernel(s) reside) and look in the config... file.</P>
<P>In the 2.6 kernel there are many options to select from in the
configuration file for compiling.  Adding support for certain
multiport cards is listed under the headings "Character devices" or
"Serial drivers".   Old multiport cards had support as part of the
serial driver and are found under "Serial Drivers".  More advanced
cards have their own driver found under "Character devices"</P>
<P>For compiling kernel 2.6 you should select "CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED".  (or
just "CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED" for 2.4).  Then you will be asked more
questions about your serial ports with more options to select.  If the
resulting configuration is not quite right, then you may need to edit
the kernel configuration file manually.</P>

<H3><A NAME="modules_"></A> Using module support </H3>

<P>A pre-compiled kernel may come with a pre-compiled module for the
board so that you don't need to recompile the kernel.  This module
must be loaded in order to use it and if there is installation
software for the driver, it should also set up Linux to load the
module (probably at boottime).  Some of the modules to load at
boottime are listed in /etc/modules or /etc/modules.conf
Also certain parameters may need to be passed
to the driver via entries in these files or via lilo's "append"
command or via grub's "kernel" command.  For kernel 2.6 (and 2.4) the
(unloaded) modules should be found in 
<CODE>/lib/modules/.../kernel/drivers/char.</CODE></P>

<H3>Getting info on multiport boards</H3>

<P> The board's manufacturer should have info on their website.
Unfortunately, info for old boards is sometimes not there but might be
found somewhere else on the Internet (including discussion groups).
You might also want to look at the kernel documentation in
/usr/share/doc/linux-doc... (formerly kernel-doc in pre 2.6 kernels).
For configuring the kernel or modules prior to compiling see:
Configure.help and search for "serial", etc.  There are also kernel
documentation files for certain boards including computone, hayes-esp,
moxa-smartio, riscom8, specialix, stallion, and sx (specialix).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.4">Multiport Devices in the /dev Directory,</A>
</H2>

<P>The serial ports your multiport board uses depends on what kind of
board you have.  Some have their own device names like /dev/ttyE27
(Stallion) or /dev/ttyD2 (Digiboard), etc.  For various other brands,
see see devices.txt in the kernel documentation.  Some use the
standard names like /dev/ttyS14 and may be found in configuration
files that used as arguments to <CODE>setserial</CODE>.  Such files may be
included in a setserial or serial package.</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_multi"></A> <A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.5">Making Legacy Multiport Devices in the /dev Directory</A>
</H2>

<P> An installation script may do this for you.  But if not, here's
some examples of how to create a device name in the /dev directory.
If you use udev, MAKEDEV will <EM>not create devices in the device
directory since this directory is only in memory and will be lost when
you turn off the computer.  Instead it will create the device in</EM>dev/.static/dev directory.</P>
<P>For the names and numbers of other types of serial ports other
than ttyS.. See devices.txt in the kernel documentation.  Either use
the <CODE>mknod</CODE> command, or the <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE> script.  Typing "man
makedev" may show instructions on using it.</P>
<P>Using the <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE> script, you would first become the superuser
(root) and type (for example) either:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# MAKEDEV ttyS17
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Or if the above doesn't work cd to /dev before giving the above
command>.  Substitute whatever your port is for ttyS17.</P>
<P>Using <CODE>mknod</CODE> is a more complicated option since you need to know
the major and minor device numbers.  These numbers are in the
"devices" file in the kernel documentation.  For ttyS serial ports the
minor number is: 64 + port number (=81 for the example below).  Note
the "major" number is always 4 for ttyS devices (and 5 for the
obsolete cua devices).  So, if you wanted to create a device for
<CODE>ttyS17</CODE> using <CODE>mknod</CODE>, you would type:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux# mknod -m 666 /dev/ttyS17 c 4 81
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.6">Standard PC Serial Cards</A>
</H2>

<P> In olden days, PCs came with a serial card installed.  Later on,
the serial function was put on the hard-drive interface card.  In the
1990s and early 2000s one or two serial ports were usually built into
the motherboard (on-board). Most of them (as of 2002) use a 16550 but
some use 16650 (32-byte FIFOs).  But one may still buy the individual
PC serial cards if they need more serial ports.  They can be used to
connect external serial devices (modems, serial mice, etc...).  Only a
tiny percentage of retail computer stores carry such cards.  But one
can purchase them on the Internet.  Before getting one for the PCI
bus, make sure Linux supports it.</P>
<P>Here's a list of a few popular brands:

</H2>

<P>Make sure that a Linux-compatible driver is available and read the
information that comes with it.  These boards use special devices (in
the /dev directory), and not the standard ttyS ones.  This information
varies depending on your hardware.  If you have updated info which
should be shown here please email it to me.</P>
<P>Names of Linux driver modules are *.ko (*.o prior to kernel 2.6) but
these may not work for all models shown.  See 
<A HREF="#modules_">Modules (mostly for smart boards)</A> The needed module may have
been supplied with your Linux distribution.  Also, parameters (such as
the io and irq often need to be given to the module so you need to
find instructions on this (possibly in the source code tree).</P>
<P>There are many different brands, each of which often offers many
different cards.  No attempt is currently being made to list all the
cards here (and many listed are obsolete and have bad internet links
to them which need to be fixed).  But all major brands and websites
should be shown here so it something is missing let me know.  Go to
the webpage shown for more information.  These websites often also
have info (ads) on related hardware such as modem pools, remote access
servers (RASs), and terminal servers.  Where there is no webpage, the
cards are likely obsolete.  If you would like to put together a better
list, let me know.</P>
