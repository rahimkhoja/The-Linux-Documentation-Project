<P><B>This HOWTO is deprecated; the Linux RAID HOWTO is maintained as a wiki by the
linux-raid community at 
<A HREF="http://raid.wiki.kernel.org/">http://raid.wiki.kernel.org/</A></B></P>
<P>While not described in this HOWTO, some useful tools for Software-RAID
systems have been developed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc10.1">RAID resizing and conversion</A>
</H2>

<P>It is not easy to add another disk to an existing array. A tool to
allow for just this operation has been developed, and is available
from 
<A HREF="http://unthought.net/raidreconf">http://unthought.net/raidreconf</A>. The tool will
allow for conversion between RAID levels, for example converting a
two-disk RAID-1 array into a four-disk RAID-5 array.  It will also
allow for chunk-size conversion, and simple disk adding.</P>
<P>Please note that this tool is not really "production ready". It seems
to have worked well so far, but it is a rather time-consuming process
that, if it fails, will absolutely guarantee that your data will be
irrecoverably scattered over your disks. <B>You absolutely
<EM>must</EM> keep good backups prior to experimenting with this
tool</B>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc10.2">Backup</A>
</H2>

<P>Remember, RAID is no substitute for good backups. No amount of
redundancy in your RAID configuration is going to let you recover week
or month old data, nor will a RAID survive fires, earthquakes, or
other disasters.</P>
<P>It is imperative that you protect your data, not just with RAID, but
with <EM>regular</EM> good backups. One excellent system for such
backups, is the 
<A HREF="http://www.amanda.org">Amanda</A>
backup system.</P>
