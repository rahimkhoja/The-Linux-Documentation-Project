<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Using Divert Sockets</A></H2>

<P>This section will give you examples of how divert sockets can be used and
how they are different of other packet interception mechanisms out there.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Divert sockets vs. other stuff</A>
</H2>

<P>There are other mechanisms out there that have similar functionality. Here
is why they are different:
<P>
<H3>Netlink sockets</H3>

<P>Netlink sockets can intercept packets just like divert sockets by using firewall
filter. They have a special type (AF_NETLINK) and on the surface seem to do the
same thing. Two major differences are:
<UL>
<LI>Netlink sockets have no ports, so it is difficult to have multiple
processes intercepting different things (divert sockets have a standard 16-bit
port space, which means you can have 65535 processes diverting packets independently)</LI>
<LI>Netlink sockets have no easy way of injecting the packets that are outbound
(going on the wire) because no special precautions are taken not to reintercept
the same packet over and over again as it is injected. Divert sockets do this
automatically</LI>
</UL>

To be fair, the scope of netlink sockets is wider than this. In general, netlink
mechanism is intended to allow communication between kernel and user space. There
are, for instance, netlink routing sockets that allow you to communicate with
the routing subsystem. However, as a packet interception mechanism, they are not as
robust as divert sockets.
<P>
<H3>Raw sockets</H3>

<P>RAW sockets can be a good way to listen in on traffic (especially under Linux, where
RAW sockets can listen in on TCP and UDP traffic, although most other UNI*s do not 
allow that) but a RAW socket can't stop a packet from propagating through the IP stack -
it simply gives you a copy of the packet and there is no way to inject it inbound
(on the way up the stack) - only outbound. Also, you can only filter pockets out by the protocol
number, which you specify when you open a RAW socket. There is no link between the firewall
and RAW sockets.
<P>
<H3>libpcap</H3>

<P>More commonly known for the tool it facilitates - tcpdump, libpcap lets you listen in
on traffic that hits your interface (whether it be ppp or eth or whatever). For 
ethernet it can also put your NIC into a promiscuous mode, so that it will forward to
IP the traffic that not only is link-layer addressed to it, but to others on the
same segment. Of course, libpcap allows for no way of actually stopping packets
from propagating and no way to inject. In fact, libpcap is in many ways orthogonal
to divert sockets.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Discussion on firewall chains</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux provides you with three default chains: input, output and forward. There
are also accounting chains, but they are of no consequence here. Depending on the
packet origin it traverses one or more of these chains:
<DL>
<DT><B>Input chain</B><DD><P>is traversed by all packets that come into the host - packets
that are addressed to it and packets that will be forwarded by it.
<DT><B>Output chain</B><DD><P>is traversed by all packets originating in the host and by
all forwarded packets
<DT><B>Forward chain</B><DD><P>is traversed only by the forwarded packets.
</DL>
<P>
<P>The order in which a forwarded packet traverses the chains is:
<OL>
<LI>Input</LI>
<LI>Forward</LI>
<LI>Output</LI>
</OL>

This may sometimes create problems for the interception if you are interested in
a certain type of packets that may or may not originate on your host. A lot of times
it is not clear which chain to use.
<P>
<P>As a rule of thumb, forward chain should only be used to filter packets that
are forwarded and are not originating and are not addressed to your host. If you
are interested in a combination of both forwarded packets and packets that are
originating or addressed to your host, then use input or output chain instead.
Intercepting on forward and input or output chain for the same type of packet 
at the same time will create problems in reinjection and, more importantly,
is unnecessary.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Using ipchains</A>
</H2>

<P>The patched version of ipchains that you will need to retrieve from the website, is
the tool that allows you to modify firewall rules from a shell (most people want that).
It is also possible to set up firewall rules programmatically. See the example code 
for this - setting up a DIVERT rule would be similar to setting up a REDIRECT
rule - specify DIVERT as a target and the divert port and you are set to go.
<P>
<P>The ipchains syntax for setting up firewall rules remains the same. To specify a 
DIVERT rule you must specify <CODE>-j DIVERT &lt;port num&gt;</CODE> as a target, everything else
remains the same. For instance
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ipchains -A input -p ICMP -j DIVERT 1234
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

would set up a divert rule for ICMP packets to be diverted from input chain to a port 1234.
<P>
<P>The following section explains how to use ipchains in conjunction with an interceptor
user-space program.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Plain vanilla example</A>
</H2>

<H3>Example program</H3>

<P>Here is an example program that reads packets from a divert socket, displays
them and then reinjects them back. It requires that the divert port is specified
on the command line.

<P>
<P>You can simply cut-n-paste the code and compile it with your favorite compiler.
If you want to enable reinjection - compile it with the -DREINJECT flag, otherwise
it will only do the interception. 
<P>
<P>In order to get it to work, compile the kernel and ipchains-1.3.8 as described 
<A HREF="Divert-Sockets-mini-HOWTO-5.html#kernel">above</A>. Insert a rule into any of the firewall chains: input,
output or forward, then send the packets that would match the rule and watch
them as they fly through the screen - your interceptor program will display
them and then reinject them back, if appropriately compiled.
<P>
<P>For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ipchains -A output -p TCP -s 172.16.128.10 -j DIVERT 4321
interceptor 4321
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will divert and display all TCP packets originating on host 172.16.128.10 (for instance
if your host is a gateway). It will intercept them on the output just before they
go on the wire.
<P>
<P>If you did not compile the pass through option into the kernel, then inserting
the rule effectively will create a DENY rule in the firewall for the packets
you specified until you start the interceptor program. See more on that 
<A HREF="Divert-Sockets-mini-HOWTO-5.html#passthru">above</A><P>
<P>If you want to set a firewall rule through your program, compile it with -DFIREWALL
option and it will divert all ICMP packets from the output chain. It will also
remove the DIVERT rule from the firewall when you use Ctrl-C to exit the program.
In this case using pass-through vs. non-pass-through divert sockets makes virtually
no difference.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 The sky's the limit</A>
</H2>

<P>As far as what you can use divert sockets for - your imagination would
be the limiting factor. I would be interested to hear about applications that
utilize divert sockets.
<P>
<P>So, have fun!
