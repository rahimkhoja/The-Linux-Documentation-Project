<P>LUGs' goals are as varied as their locales.  There is no LUG master
plan, nor will this document supply one. Remember: GNU/Linux is free from
bureaucracy and centralised control; so are LUGs.</P>
<P>It is possible, however, to identify a core set of goals for a 
LUG:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>advocacy</LI>
<LI>education</LI>
<LI>support</LI>
<LI>socialising</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Each LUG combines these and other goals uniquely, according to its
membership's needs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc4.1">GNU/Linux advocacy</A>
</H2>

<P>The urge to advocate the use of GNU/Linux is widely felt.  When you find
something that works well, you want to tell as many people as you can.
LUGs' role in advocacy cannot be overestimated, especially since
wide-scale commercial acceptance is only newly underway.  While
it is certainly beneficial to the movement, each and every time a
computer journalist writes a positive review of GNU/Linux, it is also
beneficial every time satisfied GNU/Linux users brief their friends,
colleagues, employees, or employers.</P>
<P>There is effective advocacy, and there is ineffective carping: As 
users, we must be constantly vigilant to advocate GNU/Linux in such a way as
to reflect positively on the product, its creators and developers, and
our fellow users.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Advocacy.html">Linux Advocacy HOWTO</A>, available at the 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A>, 
gives some helpful suggestions, as does Don Marti's excellent 
<A HREF="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/linuxmanship/">Linuxmanship</A> essay.
Suffice it to say that advocacy is important to a LUG's mission.</P>
<P>A time may come when advocacy is irrelevant, because GNU/Linux has
more or less won the day, when the phrase "no one ever got fired for
using Linux" becomes reality. Until then, LUGs play a vital role in
promoting GNU/Linux use. They do so because their advocacy is free,
well-intentioned, and backed up by organisational commitment. If a
person encounters GNU/Linux through a LUG's efforts, then that new
user's already ahead of the game: <I>She knows of an organisation that
will help her install, configure, and even maintain GNU/Linux on whatever
computers she's willing to dedicate to it.</I></P>
<P>New users already in contact with a LUG are ahead
of others whose interest in GNU/Linux has been piqued by a computer
journalist, but who have no one to whom to turn for aid in their
quest to install, run, and learn GNU/Linux.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, important for LUGs to advocate GNU/Linux, because
their advocacy is effective, well-supported, and free.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc4.2">The limits of advocacy</A>
</H2>

<P>Advocacy can be mis-aimed; advocacy can go wrong and be
counterproductive; advocacy can be simply inappropriate in the first
place.  The matter merits careful thought, to avoid wasted time or
worse.</P>
<P>Many attempts at advocacy fail ignominiously because the advocate fails
to listen to what the other party feels she wants or needs.  (As Eric
S. Raymond 
<A HREF="http://www.itworld.com/LWD000913expo00">says</A>, 
"Appeal to the prospect's interests and values, not to
yours.") If that person wants exactly the proprietary-OS setup she
already has, then advocacy wastes your time and hers.  If her
stated requirements equate exactly to MS-Project, MS-Visio, and
Outlook/Exchange groupware, then trying to "sell" her what she doesn't
want will only annoy everyone (regardless of whether her requirements
list is real or artificial).  Save your effort for someone more
receptive.  </P>
<P>Along those lines, bear in mind that, for many people, perhaps most, an
"advocate" is perceived as a salesman, and thus classified as someone to
resist rather than listen to fairly.  They've never heard of someone
urging them to adopt a piece of software without
benefiting materially, so they assume there must be something in
it for you and will push back, and
act as if they're doing you a personal favour to even listen, let alone
try your recommendations.  </P>
<P>I recommend bringing such discussions back to Earth
immediately, by pointing out that software policy should be based in
one's own long-term self interest, that you have zero personal stake in
their choices, and that you have better uses for your time than speaking
to an unreceptive audience. After that, if
they're still interested, at least you won't face the same artificial
obstacle.</P>
<P>At the same time, make sure you don't live up to the stereotype of the
OS advocate, either.  Just proclaiming your views at someone without
invitation is downright rude and offensive.  Moreover, when done
concerning GNU/Linux, it's also pointless:  Unlike the case with proprietary
OSes, our OS will not live or die by the level of its acceptance and
release/maintenance of ported applications.  It and all key applications
are open source: the programmer community that maintains it is
self-supporting, and would keep it advancing and and healthy regardless
of whether the business world and general public uses it with wild
abandon, only a little, or not at all. Because of its open-source
licence terms, source code is permanently available. GNU/Linux cannot be
"withdrawn from the market" on account of insufficient popularity, or at
the whim of some company.  Accordingly, there is simply no point in
arm-twisting OS advocacy -- unlike that of some OS-user communities we
could mention.   (Why not just make information available for those
receptive to it, and stop there?  That meets any reasonable person's
needs.)</P>
<P>Last, understand that the notion of "use value" for software is quite
foreign to most people -- the notion of measuring software's value by
what you can do with it.  The habit of valuing everything at
<I>acquisition cost</I> is deeply ingrained.  In 1996, I heard a young
fellow from Caldera Systems speak at a Berkeley, California LUG about
the origins of Caldera Network Desktop (the initial name of their GNU/Linux
distribution) in Novell, Inc.'s "Corsair" desktop-OS project:  In
surveying corporate CEOs and CTOs, they found corporate officers to be
inherently unhappy with anything they could get for free.  So, Caldera
offered them a solution -- by charging money.</P>
<P>Seen from this perspective, being conservative about the costs and
difficulties of GNU/Linux deployments helps make them positively attractive
-- and protects your credibility as a spokesman.  Even better would be
to frame the discussion of costs in terms of the cost of functionality
(e.g., 1000-seat Internet-capable company e-mail with offline-user
capability and webmail) as opposed to listing software as a retail-style
line-item with pricing:  After all, any software project has costs,
even if the acquisition price tag is zero, and the real point of open
source isn't initial cost but rather long-term control over IT -- a key
part of one's operations:  With proprietary systems, the user (or
business) has lost control of IT, and is on the wrong side of a monopoly
relationship with one's vendor.  With open source, the user is in
control, and nobody can take that away.  Explained that way (as
opportunity to reduce and control IT risk), people readily understand
the difference -- especially CEOs -- and it's much more significant over
the long term than acquisition cost.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc4.3">GNU/Linux education</A>
</H2>

<P>Not only is it the business of a LUG to advocate GNU/Linux usage, but
also to train members, as well as the nearby computing public,
to use our OS and associated components -- a goal that can make a huge
real-world difference in one's local area.  While universities and
colleges are increasingly including GNU/Linux in their curricula, for
sundry reasons, this won't reach some users.  For those, a LUG can
give basic or advanced help in system administration, programming,
Internet and intranet technologies, etc.</P>
<P>In an ironic twist, many LUGs have turned out to be a backbone of
corporate support: Every worker expanding her computer skills through
LUG participation is one fewer the company must train.  Though home
GNU/Linux administration doesn't exactly scale to running corporate data
warehouses, call centres, or similar high-availability facilities, it's
light years better preparation than MS-Windows experience.  As Linux has
advanced into journaling filesystems, high availability, real-time
extensions, and other high-end Unix features, the already blurry line
between GNU/Linux and "real" Unixes has been increasingly vanishing.</P>
<P>Not only is such education a form of worker training, but it will also
serve, as information technology becomes increasingly vital to the
global economy, as community service: In the USA's metropolitan areas,
for example, LUGs have taken GNU/Linux into local schools, small businesses,
community and social organisations, and other non-corporate
environments. This accomplishes the goal of advocacy and also
educates the general public.  As more such organisations seek Internet
presence,  provide their personnel dial-in access, or other
GNU/Linux-relevant functions, LUGs gain opportunities for community
participation, through awareness and education efforts -- extending to
the community the same generous spirit characteristic of GNU/Linux and the
free software / open source community from its very beginning. Most
users can't program like Torvalds, but we can all give time and
effort to other users, the GNU/Linux community, and the broader
surrounding community.</P>
<P>GNU/Linux is a natural fit for these organisations, because deployments
don't commit them to expensive licence, upgrade, or maintenance fees.
Being technically elegant and economical, it also runs very well on
cast-off corporate hardware that non-profit organisations are only too
happy to use: The unused Pentium II in the closet can do <B>real
work</B>, if someone installs GNU/Linux on it.</P>
<P>In addition, education assists other LUG goals over time, in
particular that of support: Better education means better
support, which in turn facilitates education, and eases the 
community's growth.  Thus, education forms the entire effort's keystone:
If only two or three percent of a LUG assume the remainder's support
burden, that LUG's growth will be stifled. One thing you can count on:
<B><I>If new and inexperienced users don't get needed help
from their LUG, they won't participate there for long</I></B>.
If a larger percentage of members support the rest, the LUG will not
face that limitation. education -- and, equally, support for
allied projects such as the Apache Web server, X.org, Freedesktop.org, 
TeX, LaTeX, etc.  -- is key to this dynamic: Education turns new users into
experienced ones.</P>
<P>Finally, GNU/Linux is a self-documenting operating environment: In other words,
writing and publicising our community's documentation is up to us.
Therefore, make sure LUG members know of the 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> and its worldwide
mirrors.  Consider operating an LDP mirror site.  Also, make sure to
publicise -- through <CODE>comp.os.linux.announce</CODE>, the LDP, and other
pertinent sources of information -- any relevant documentation
the LUG develops: technical presentations, tutorials, local FAQs, etc.
LUGs' documentation often fails to benefit the worldwide 
community for no better reason than not notifying the outside world.
Don't let that happen: It is highly probable that if someone at one LUG
had a question or problem with something, then others elsewhere
will have it, too.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc4.4">GNU/Linux support</A>
</H2>

<P>Of course, for the <B>newcomer</B>, the primary role of a
LUG is GNU/Linux support -- but it is a mistake to suppose that 
support means only <I>technical</I> support for new users. It
should mean much more.</P>
<P>LUGs have the opportunity to support:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>users</LI>
<LI>consultants</LI>
<LI>businesses, non-profit organisations, and schools</LI>
<LI>the GNU/Linux movement</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Users</H3>

<P>New users' most frequent complaint, once they have GNU/Linux
installed, is the steep learning curve characteristic of all modern 
Unixes. With that learning curve, however, comes the power and 
flexibility of a real operating system. A LUG is often the a new 
user's main resource to flatten the learning curve.</P>
<P>During GNU/Linux's first decade, it gained some first-class journalistic 
resources, which should not be neglected:  The main monthly magazines
of longest standing are <I>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</A></I> and <I>
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/">Linux Gazette</A></I>.  More recently, 
they've been joined by 
<I>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxfocus.org/">LinuxFocus</A></I> and the
<I>
<A HREF="http://new.linuxfocus.org/cms/">New LinuxFocus</A></I> (on-line),
<I>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxformat.com">Linux Format</A></I>,
<I>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/">LinuxUser and Developer</A></I>,
<I>
<A HREF="http://www.linux-magazine.com/">Linux Magazine</A></I>, and
<I>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxforu.com/">LINUX For You</A></I>.</P>
<P>Standout on-line magazines and news sites with weekly or better publication 
cycles include <I>
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</A></I>, 
<I>
<A HREF="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php">DistroWatch Weekly</A></I>,
<I>
<A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com">Linux Today</A></I>, and
<A HREF="http://www.freshnews.org/">FreshNews</A>.</P>
<P>All of these resources have eased LUGs' job of spreading essential
news and information --  about bug fixes, security problems, patches, 
new kernels, etc., but new users must still be made aware of
them, and taught that the newest kernels are always
available from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org">ftp.kernel.org</A>,
that the 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A>
has newer versions of Linux HOWTOs than do CD-based GNU/Linux distributions, 
and so on.</P>
<P>Intermediate and advanced users
also benefit from proliferation of timely and useful tips, facts,
and secrets. Because of the GNU/Linux world's manifold aspects, even
advanced users often learn new tricks or techniques simply by
participating in a LUG. Sometimes, they learn of software packages
they didn't know existed; sometimes, they just remember arcane
<CODE>vi</CODE> command sequences they've not used since college.</P>

<H3>Consultants</H3>


<P>LUGs can help consultants find their customers and vice-versa,
by providing a forum where they can come together.
Consultants also aid LUGs by providing experienced leadership.
New and inexperienced users gain benefit from both LUGs and
consultants, since their routine or simple requests for support are
handled by LUGs <I>gratis</I>, while their complex needs and problems --
the kind requiring paid services -- can be fielded by consultants found 
through the LUG.</P>
<P>The line between support requests needing a consultant and those
that don't is sometimes indistinct; but, in most cases, the difference
is clear. While a LUG doesn't want to gain the reputation for
pawning new users off unnecessarily on consultants -- as this is simply
rude and very anti-GNU/Linux behaviour -- there is no reason for LUGs not to
help broker contacts between users needing consulting services and
professionals offering them.</P>
<P>Caveat:  While "the difference is clear" to intelligent people of goodwill,
the Inevitable Ones are <I>also</I> always with us, who act willfully
dense about the limits of free support when they have pushed those
limits too far.  Remember, too, my earlier point about the vast majority
of the population valuing everything at acquisition cost (instead of use
value), <I>including what they receive for free</I>.  This leads some,
especially some in the corporate world, to use (and abuse) LUG
technical support with wild abandon, while simultaneously complaining
bitterly of its inadequate detail, insufficient promptness, supposedly
unfair expectations that the user learn and not re-ask minor variations on
the same question endlessly, etc.  In other words, they treat relations
with LUG volunteers the way they would a paid support vendor, but one
they treat with <I>zero respect</I> because of its zero acquisition
cost.</P>
<P>In the consulting world, there's a saying about applying "invoice therapy" 
to such behaviour:  Because of the value system alluded to above, if
your consulting advice is poorly heeded and poorly used, it just might
be the case that you need to charge more.  By contrast, the technical
community has often been characterised as a "gift culture", with a
radically different value system: Members gain status through enhanced
reputation among peers, which in turn they improve through visible
participation:  code, documentation, technical assistance to the public,
etc.</P>
<P>Clash between the two very different value-based cultures is inevitable
and can become a bit ugly.  LUG activists should be prepared to intercede
before the ingrate newcomer is handed her head on a platter, and
politely suggest that her needs would be better served by paid
(consultant-based) services.  There will always be judgement calls;
the borderline is inherently debatable and a likely source of
controversy.</P>
<P>Telltale signs that a questioner may need to be transitioned to consulting-based assistance include:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An insistence on getting solutions in "recipe" (rote) form, 
with the apparent aim of not needing to learn technological 
fundamentals.</LI>
<LI>Asking the same questions (or ones closely related) repeatedly.</LI>
<LI>Insisting on <I>private</I> assistance from helpers active in
<I>public</I> (GNU/Linux community) forums.</LI>
<LI>Vague problem descriptions, or ones that change with time.</LI>
<LI>Interrupting answers in order to ask additional questions 
(suggesting lack of attention to the answers).</LI>
<LI>Demands that answers be recast or delivered more quickly 
(suggesting that the questioner's time and trouble are 
valuable, but that helpers' are not).</LI>
<LI>Asking unusually complex, time-consuming, and/or multipart 
questions.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>In general, LUG members are especially delighted to help, on a volunteer
basis, members who seem likely to participate in the "gift
culture" by picking up its body of  lore and, in turn, perpetuating it
by teaching others in their turn.  Certainly, there's nothing wrong with
having other priorities and values, but such folk may in some cases be
best referred to paid assistance, as a better fit for their needs.</P>
<P>An additional observation that may or may not be useful, at this point:
There are things one may be willing to do for free, to assist others in the
community, that one will refuse to do for money:  Shifting from
assisting someone as a volunteer fundamentally changes the relationship.
A fellow computerist who suddenly becomes a customer is a very different
person; one's responsibilities are quite different, and greater.  You're
advised to be aware, if not wary, of this distinction.</P>
<P>Please see Joshua Drake's 
<A HREF="http://www.commandprompt.com/community/consultants/guide/">Linux Consultants Guide</A> for an
international list of GNU/Linux consultants.</P>

<H3>Businesses, non-profit organisations, and schools</H3>

<P>LUGs also have the opportunity to support local businesses and
organisations. This support has two aspects: First, LUGs can support
businesses and organisations wanting to use our OS (and its 
applications) as a part of their
computing and IT efforts. Second, LUGs can support local businesses
and organisations developing software for GNU/Linux, cater to users,
support or install distributions, etc.</P>
<P>The support LUGs can provide to local businesses wanting to use GNU/Linux as
a part of their computing operations differs little from the help LUGs
give individuals trying GNU/Linux at home. For example, compiling the Linux
kernel doesn't really differ. Supporting businesses, however, may
require supporting proprietary software -- e.g., the Oracle, Sybase,
and DB2 databases (or VMware, Win4Lin, and such things).   
Some LUG expertise in these areas may help businesses make the leap
into GNU/Linux deployments.</P>
<P>This leads us directly to the second kind of support a LUG can give to
local businesses: LUGs can serve as a clearinghouse for information
available in few other places. For example:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Which local ISP is Linux-friendly?</LI>
<LI>Are there any local hardware vendors building Linux PCs?</LI>
<LI>Does anyone sell Linux CDs locally?</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Maintaining and making this kind of information public not only helps
the LUG members, but also helps friendly businesses and encourages
them to continue to be GNU/Linux-friendly. It may even, in some cases, help
further a competitive environment in which other businesses are
encouraged to follow suit.</P>

<H3>Free / open-source software development</H3>

<P>Finally, LUGs may also support the movement by soliciting and
organising charitable giving. 
<A HREF="mailto:%20cbbrowne@cbbrowne.com%20">Chris Browne</A> has thought about this issue as much as
anyone I know, and he contributes the following:</P>

<H3>Chris Browne on free software / open source philanthropy</H3>

<P> 
A further involvement can be to encourage sponsorship of various
GNU/Linux-related organisations in a financial way.  With the 
<A HREF="http://linuxcounter.net/">multiple millions</A> of users,
it would be entirely plausible for grateful users to individually
contribute a little. Given millions of users, and the not-unreasonable
sum of a hundred dollars of "gratitude" per user ($100 being
roughly the sum <I>not</I> spent this year upgrading a Microsoft OS),
that could add up to <I>hundreds of millions</I> of dollars towards
development of improved GNU/Linux tools and applications.</P>

<P> 
A user group can encourage members to contribute to various
"development projects". Having some form of "charitable tax exemption"
status can encourage members to contribute directly to the group,
getting tax deductions as appropriate, with contributions flowing on to
other organisations.</P>

<P> 
It is appropriate, in any case, to encourage LUG members to direct
contributions to organisations with projects and goals they
individually wish to support.</P>

<P> 
This section lists possible candidates. None is being explicitly 
recommended here, but the list represents useful food for
thought.  Many are registered as charities in the USA, thus
making US contributions tax-deductible.</P>

<P>Here are organisations with activities particularly directed towards
development of software working with GNU/Linux:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>

</P>

<P>Contributions to these organisations have the direct effect of
supporting creation of freely redistributable software usable with
GNU/Linux.  Dollar for dollar, such contributions almost certainly yield
greater benefit to the community than any other kind of spending.</P>

<P> 
There are also organisations less directly associated with GNU/Linux, that
may nonetheless be worthy of assistance, such as:</P>

<P>Based in San Francisco, EFF is a donor-supported membership organization
working to protect our fundamental rights regardless of technology; to
educate the press, policy-makers, and the general public about civil
liberties issues related to technology; and to act as a defender of 
those liberties. Among our various activities, EFF opposes misguided
legislation, initiates and defends court cases preserving individuals'
rights, launches global public campaigns, introduces leading edge

<H3>Linux movement</H3>

<P>I have referred throughout this HOWTO to what I call the <B>GNU/Linux
movement</B>. There really is no better way to describe the
international GNU/Linux phenomenon: It isn't a bureaucracy, but is
organised. It isn't a corporation, but is important to businesses
everywhere. The best way for a LUG to support the international GNU/Linux
movement is to keep the local community robust, vibrant, and
growing. GNU/Linux is <I>developed</I> internationally, which is easy
enough to see by reading the kernel source code's 
MAINTAINERS file -- but
GNU/Linux is also <I>used</I> internationally.  This ever-expanding
user base is key to GNU/Linux's continued success, and is where the LUGs
are vital.</P>
<P>The movement's strength internationally lies in offering
unprecedented computing power and sophistication for its cost and
freedom. The keys are value and independence from proprietary control.
Every time a new person, group, business, or organisation experiences
GNU/Linux's inherent value, the movement grows.  LUGs help that
happen.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="User-Group-HOWTO.html#toc4.5">Linux socialising</A>
</H2>

<P>The last goal of a LUG we'll cover is socialising -- in some ways,
the most difficult goal to discuss, because it isn't clear how
many or to what degree LUGs do it. While it would be strange to
have a LUG that didn't engage in the other goals, there may be
LUGs for which socialising isn't a factor.</P>
<P>It seems, however, that whenever two or three GNU/Linux users get together,
fun, hijinks, and, often, beer follow. Linus Tovalds has
always had one enduring goal for Linux: to have more fun. For hackers,
kernel developers, and GNU/Linux users, there's nothing quite like
downloading a new kernel, recompiling an old one, fooling with a
window manager, or hacking some code. GNU/Linux's sheer fun keeps many
LUGs together, and leads LUGs naturally to socialising.</P>
<P>By "socialising", here I mean primarily sharing experiences, forming
friendships, and mutually-shared admiration and respect. There is
another meaning, however -- one social scientists call
<I>acculturation</I>. In any movement, institution, or human
community, there is the need for some process or pattern of events in
and by which, to put it in GNU/Linux terms, newcomers are turned into
hackers. In other words, acculturation turns you from "one of them" to
"one of us".</P>
<P>It is important that new users come to learn GNU/Linux culture,
concepts, traditions, and vocabulary.  GNU/Linux acculturation, unlike "real
world" acculturation, can occur on mailing lists and Usenet, although
the latter's efficacy is challenged by poorly acculturated users and by
spam. LUGs are often much more efficient at this task than are mailing 
lists or newsgroups, precisely because of the former's greater interactivity 
and personal focus.</P>
