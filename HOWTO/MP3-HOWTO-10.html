<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Encoding from CD-ROM.</A></H2>

<P>In a similar way to encoding from audio, encoding from CD is a 2 stage process.  Firstly the audio data is extracted from the cd and converted into a wav file.  Then the wav file is converted into MP3.
<P>There are basically 2 types of encoders, console based and X based.  Both do the same job, but the X based are easier to use (and look nicer).
<P>Again, before you start to encode, check you will have enough drive space on your system.           
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 Command Line encoding</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>I've written a very simple Perl script that will rip and encode tracks
from a CD.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#!/usr/bin/perl

if ($ARGV[0] ne "") {

$count = 1;

do {
 
$cdcap = system("cdparanoia", $count, "/mp3/cdda.wav");
$track = "$ARGV[1]/track".$count.".mp3";
$enc = system("bladeenc  /mp3/cdda.wav $track -br 256000");
$count++;

}
until $count > $ARGV[0];
exit;
}

else {
print "Usage cdriper [no of tracks] [destination directory]\n\n";
}
</PRE>
<HR>

Please note: The above script is very basic and has nothing fancy, like
error checking or CDDB.  Improve at your leisure :)
<P>The main lines of interest are: 
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
$cdcap = system("cdparanoia", $count, "/mp3/cdda.wav");
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>This line calls the CD ripper, cdparanoia.  Cdparanoia converts raw CD audio
data to WAV format.
<P>I'm using Cdparanoia, but if you wish to use CDDA2WAV, the command line
would be:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
$cdcap = system("cdda2wav", $count, "/mp3/cdda.wav");
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The salient options are $count, which is the number of tracks to rip, and
then the path for the outputted WAV file.  In my example this will go to a
tmp directory on my MP3 SCSI drive.
<P>The WAV file is then converted into a MP3 file using Bladeenc.
<P>I've written this Perl script in order to rip a CD without having to rip and
encode each track, and without having to use the batch mode of Cdparanoia. 
This cuts down on free disk space needed as Cdparanoia's batch mode will
rip the whole disk, and take up anything upto 600 Meg.
<P>If you wanted to use Lame or Gogo, replace the encoder line with:  
<HR>
<PRE>
$enc = system("lame  /mp3/cdda.wav $track -b 256");
</PRE>
<HR>

or
<HR>
<PRE>
$enc = system("gogo  /mp3/cdda.wav $track -b 256");
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Here is a dump of the available option for each of the encoders.

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 GUI Based Encoders</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>GUI based encoders offer all the functionality of console based encoding, but wrap it all up in a nice easy to use interface. Grip and RipperX are similar in operation, both offer you the ability to select one, several or all tracks on a CD and convert them.  They also offer CDDB support which allows you  to retrieve the album and track information from a server and saves you having to enter the information by hand.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3 Encoder Performance</A>
</H2>

<P>In the encoding sections I've mentioned 3 different encoders, bladeenc, lame and gogo.  The main difference is their performance in encoding (although there are differences in the available options which were listed earlier).
<P>A little example.  I ripped a track from a CD and then encoded it with the different encoders. All encoders were run with the same system conditions and all produced stereo out mp3's.
