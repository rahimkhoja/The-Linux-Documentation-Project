>Read this section carefully before you plan to upgrade kernel on your Linux machine with Promise FastTrack RAID. Unless you are not using Promise FastTrack at all in any way, you need this information to avoid problems.</P
><P
>Always backup your data before kernel upgrade. Also backup <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot/vmlinuz-currentversion</TT
> and  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot/initrd.img</TT
> (if you use initrd). When you upgrade your kernel, do not delete old kernel or its dependent files in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> and do not delete the lines corresponding to it in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>. If you upgrade kernel to say 2.4.19, just create another kernel section in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>. For example, add the following lines to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>:</P

><P
>OS stands for "Operating System" or more specifically Red Hat Linux Operating System in our case.  When you install Linux on mirrored partitions such as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/ataraid/d0p1</TT
> (or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda1</TT
> when using Promise Technology proprietary driver), you are said to have your OS on RAID mirror.  If your Linux machine has only the main partitions such as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> on RAID, it is also called (a case of) OS on RAID.</P
><P
>Partitions created by user to make use of available free partitions such as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mydata1</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/imp</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/scratch</TT
> are not part of Linux OS because Linux does not install any files into them by default when you install Linux or upgrade any standard Linux software package. Any data in such user partitions becomes user data or alternatively, non-OS data. It is a good idea to use only ext3 and swap file systems for OS partitions. For non-OS partitions, you can use other file systems such as ext2 and dos (if you have another operating system like Windows on the same Linux computer or if you just feel like you love dos so much). However, why do you want to use ext2 if you dont have to and you have a better choice of using ext3 for OS or non-OS partitions?</P

NAME="CASE1">8.1. Promise Technology (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ft</TT
>) Driver with OS on RAID mirror</H2
><P
>Currently, Promise Technology supports Red Hat 7.2 and earlier versions only. Red Hat 7.2 uses kernel 2.4.7-10 by default. Also note that, you have to use initrd.img (Initial RAM disk image) in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>, when you install Linux with Promise supplied driver. At the time of installation, Promise Driver scripts are supposed to automatically generate initrd file and configure <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
> for you. Unfortunately, this does not work properly and you may have to manually create initrd.img and configure <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
> yourself.</P
><P
>You are stuck with the default kernel 2.4.7-10 and you cannot and should not upgrade kernel either by compiling or by automatic update programs such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>up2date</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpm</B
> utility. If you really really want to upgrade kernel then do so but do not use raid. You can add <EM
>Append Line</EM
> to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
> as explained in <A
HREF="existing.html#DETERMINE"
>Section 7.2</A
> and do not load ataraid module (or do not compile your new kernel with ataraid feature built-in).  By doing this, you are upgrading kernel to new version and sacrificing RAID feature because you are using Promise Technology card as a simple IDE extension card.</P
><P
>If Promise Technology releases new version of their <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ft</TT
> driver for 2.4.19 in future, you can then upgrade your kernel first to 2.4.19 (using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>up2date</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpm</B
> but not by manually compiling) and place their new version of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ft.o</TT
> file in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/kernel-2.4.19</TT
>. You will also have to put <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>initrd-2.4.19</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/boot</TT
> and append <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>initrd=</TT
> line to the new kernel section in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>. If your Linux  machine uses Promise Technology driver, your OS is on RAID mirror and Promise Technology did not release any new versions for new kernel versions, please do not fool around with your current kernel. If you do fool around, remember that you can seriously damage your computer and not be able to boot or retrieve your data.</P

><P
>Almost all of explanation in previous case (Promise Technology (<TT

That means, if your upgrade fails, you will be able to boot but not be able to see data in your RAID partitions. Additionally, you have the flexibility of loading and unloading Promise Proprietary driver (<TT
