This is the Linux Linmodem HOWTO document. It is intended as
a quick reference to help you find out if there is a way to get your (so-called) winmodem
working under Linux, and, if so, how to do it.  You should understand
from the outset that there may well be <EM>no</EM> support for your winmodem:
there is limited support for such modems, often in the form of vendor-created
but vendor-unsupported, binary-only kernel modules (though a small number of open-source
projects exist).  
<P>To emphasize: your best bet under Linux is <EM>certainly</EM> to get 
a true hardware modem.  However, if you're stuck with a winmodem, perhaps
this document can help.
