                    Also copy the dm/scripts/devmap_mknod.sh script into

                    for now so you have access to the LVM 1 tools if you
                    need them.  If you have access to packages for LVM 2
                    and device-mapper, you can install those instead,
                    but beware of them overwriting your LVM 1 tool set.

              No.  You need device-mapper.  The lvm2 tools use
              device-mapper to interface with the kernel and do all
              their device mapping (hence the name device-mapper).  As
              long as you have device-mapper, you should be able to
              use LVM2.

              the latest version of device-mapper.)  It's pretty easy

              If you are using the stable 2.4 device mapper patch from
              the lvm2 tarball, all the major functionality you'd
              expect using lvm1 is supported with the lvm2 tools.
              (You still need to remove snapshots before upgrading
              from lvm1 to lvm2)

              Yes. LVM 2 uses lvm 2 format metadata.  This format is much
              more flexible than the LVM 1 format metadata, removing
              or reducing most of the limitations LVM 1 had.

              Yes.  LVM 2 will activate and operate on VG and LVs created

              LVM 1 - these should be removed before upgrading.  Snapshots
              that remain after upgrading will have to be removed before
              their origins can be activated by LVM 2.

              One possible cause of this is that some versions of LVM
              1 (The user that reported this bug originally was using
              Mandrake 9.2, but it is not necessarily limited to that
              distribution) did not put a UUID into the PV and VG
              structures as they were supposed to.  The most current
              versions of the LVM 2 tools automatically fill UUIDs in
              for the structures if they see they are missing, so you
              should grab a more current version and your problem
              should be solved.  If not, post to the <A

              Upgrading to LVM 2 is a bit trickier with root on LVM,
              but it's not impossible.  You need to queue up a kernel
              with device-mapper support and install the lvm2 tools
              (you might want to make a backup of the lvm 1 tools, or
              find a rescue disk with the lvm tools built in, in case
              you need them before you're done).  Then find a mkinitrd
              script that has support for your distro and lvm 2.

                      handles lvm2, but it relies on a statically

              How resilient is LVM to a sudden renumbering of
              physical hard disks?

              It's fine - LVM identifies PVs by UUID, not by device
              name.
            </P
><P
>&#13;              Each disk (PV) is labeled with a UUID, which uniquely
              identifies it to the system.  'vgscan' identifies this
              after a new disk is added that changes your drive
              numbering.  Most distros run vgscan in the lvm startup
              scripts to cope with this on reboot after a hardware
              addition.  If you're doing a hot-add, you'll have to run
              this by hand I think.  On the other hand, if your vg is
              activated and being used, the renumbering should not
              affect it at all.  It's only the activation that needs
              the identifier, and the worst case scenario is that the
              activation will fail without a vgscan with a complaint
              about a missing PV.

              I'm trying to fill my vg, and vgdisplay/vgs says that I
              have 1.87 GB free, but when I do an lvcreate vg -L1.87G
              it says "insufficient free extends".  What's going on?
            </P

              The 1.87 GB figure is rounded to 2 decimal places, so
              it's probably 1.866 GB or something.  This is a
              human-readable output to give you a general idea of how
              big the VG is.  If you want to specify an exact size,
              you must use extents instead of some multiple of bytes.
            </P
><P
>&#13;              In the case of vgdisplay, use the Free PE count instead
              of the human readable capacity.

              So, this would indicate that you should do run

            </P
><P
>&#13;              In the case of vgs, you need to instruct it to tell you how many extents are available:
              <TABLE

              </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
              This tell vgs to add the free extents and the total
              number of extents to the end of the vgs listing.  Use
              the free extent number the same way you would in the
              above vgdisplay case.

              How are snapshots in LVM2 different from LVM1?

              In LVM2 snapshots are read/write by default, whereas in
              LVM1, snapshots were only read-only.  See <A

	      What is the maximum size of a single LV?

	      The answer to this question depends upon the CPU
	      architecture of your computer and the kernel you are a
	      running:
	      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    For 2.4 based kernels, the maximum LV size is 2TB.
		    For some older kernels, however, the limit was 1TB
		    due to signedness problems in the block layer.
		    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 5 has fixes to
		    allow the full 2TB LVs.  Consult your distribution
		    for more information in this regard.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    For 32-bit CPUs on 2.6 kernels, the maximum LV size is 16TB.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    For 64-bit CPUs on 2.6 kernels, the maximum LV
		    size is 8EB. (Yes, that is a very large number.)
