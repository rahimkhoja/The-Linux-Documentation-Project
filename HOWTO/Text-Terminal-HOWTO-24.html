<P> Here are notes by brand name that were too specific to a certain
terminal to be put elsewhere in this HOWTO.  If you have some info to
contribute on a certain terminal that is not covered elsewhere, it
could go here.  Various models often have much in common so such
common information need only be written about once.  It would be
nice if for each terminal model, there were a set of links linking to
most of the documentation relevant to that model (including escape
codes).  But it hasn't been done.  Note that some VT (DEC) manuals are
now available on the Internet.  See and 
<A HREF="#dec_">VT (DEC)</A>.  Wyse put the information from its manuals on the
Internet but it can't be readily found now (2013).  </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss24.1">24.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc24.1">Adds</A>
</H2>

<P>The Adds terminal menu incorrectly used "Xon/Xoff" to mean any kind
of flow control.  True for which models ??</P>
<P>Adds, which made the Adds Viewpoint terminal, was taken over by
Boundless Technologies in 1994 but they continued to use the "Adds"
name.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss24.2">24.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc24.2">CIT</A>
</H2>

<P> CIT terminals were made in Japan in the 1980's for CIE Terminals.
They ceased to be imported in the late 1980's.  The company, CIE,
still made CItoh printers (in 1997) but has no parts for its
abandoned terminals.  Ernie at (714) 453-9555 in Irvine CA sold (in
1997) some parts for models 224, 326, etc. but has nothing for the 80
and 101.</P>
<P>To save the Set-Up parameters press ^S when in Set-Up mode.
cit80: Contrast: knob on rear of terminal,
cit101e: Brightness: use up/down arrow keys in Set-Up mode.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ibm_"></A> <A NAME="ss24.3">24.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc24.3">IBM Terminals </A>
</H2>

<P> Don't confuse IBM terminals with IBM PC monitors.  Many IBM
terminals don't use ASCII but instead use an 8-bit EBCDIC code.  It's
claimed that in EBCDIC the bit order of transmission is reversed from
normal with the high-order bit going first.  The IBM mainframe
communication standards are a type of synchronous communication in
block mode (sends large packets of characters).  Two standards are
"BISYNC" and "SNA" (which includes networking standards).  Many of
their terminals connect with coax cable (RG62A/U) and naive persons
may think the "BNC" connecter on the terminal is for ethernet (but
it's not).</P>
<P>While this IBM system is actually  more efficient than what is
normally used in Linux, terminals meeting this IBM standard will not
currently work with Linux.  However, some IBM terminals are
asynchronous ASCII terminals and should work with Linux on PC's.  The
numbers 31xx may work with the exception that 317x and 319x are not
ASCII terminals.  Before getting an IBM terminal, make sure there is a
termcap (terminfo) for it.  If their isn't, it likely will not work
with Linux.  Even if there is a terminfo, it may not work.  For
example, there is a termcap for 327x but the 3270 is an EBCDIC
synchronous terminal.</P>
<P>The 3270 series includes the 3278 (late 1970's), 3279 with color and
graphics, and the 3274 terminal controller (something like the 3174).
They may be used for both BISYNC and SNA.  The 3290 has a split screen
(splits into quarters).</P>
<P>The synchronous IBM terminals don't connect directly to the IBM
mainframe, but connect to a "terminal controller" (sometimes called
"cluster controller" or "communication controller").  Some of these
controllers can convert a synchronous signal to asynchronous so that in
this case a synchronous terminal could indirectly connect to a
Unix-like host computer via its serial port.  But there is still a
major problem and that is block transmission.  See section 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-23.html#block">Block Mode</A>.</P>

<H3>IBM 3153</H3>

<P> It's claimed that the Aux port is DCE and uses a straight-thru
cable.</P>

</H2>

<P> These are antiques and represent the oldest terminals.  They are
like remotely controlled typewriters but are large and noisy.  Made by
the Teletype Corp., the first models were made in the 1920's and
predate the computer by over 30 years.  Early models used
electro-mechanical relays and rotating distributors instead of
electronics.  Their Baudot code was only 5-bits per character as
compared to 7-bit ASCII.  See the book "Small Computer Systems
Handbook" by Sol Libes, Hayden Books, 1978: pp. 138-141 ("Teletypes").</P>

</H2>

<P> Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) made the famous VT series of
terminals including the commonly emulated VT100.  </P>
<P>In 1995 DEC sold their terminal business to Boundless Technologies.
Boundless went bankrupt in 2003 but emerged from bankruptcy in 2006 as
a division of "Visual Technologies".  Then in 2008 they were acquired
by Video Display Corporation and given to their Z-AXIS subsidiary
located near Rochester, New York.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.boundless.com/terminals.html">Boundless</A> name
and url have been retained.</P>
<P>Detailed VT terminal information, some manuals, and
history is at 
<A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/">http://www.vt100.net/</A>.</P>
<P>VT220: Some have a BNC connector for video output (not for input).
Sometimes people erroneously think this is for an ethernet connection.</P>
<P>VT510, 520, 525: Supports full DTR/DSR flow control.  Some are "low
emissions" models. The 520 is multi-session and the 525 has colors for
highlighting.</P>
<P>Dorio is a lower quality model which can emulate many other terminals.
The "sco unix console" is claimed to be a powerful emulation using the
"scoansi" terminfo.</P>

<P> detailed manual-like information on old terminals see 
<A HREF="http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/wyseterm.asp">http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/wyseterm.asp</A>.  This
information includes specs, lists of escape sequences, part lists,
FAQs, setup info, etc.   Thanks to Wyse for providing this even though
as of 2006 they are no longer making text terminals.</P>
<P>Wyse terminals were lower in cost than other brands and they captured
a major share of the market.  There were concerns about the quality of
these terminals, especially the Wyse 50.  But the large number of
failure reports (other than Wyse 50) may be due in part to the large
number of Wyse terminals in use.</P>
<P>See 
<A HREF="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Wyse">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Wyse</A> for a history of Wyse.</P>

<H3>Wyse 50</H3>

<P>Reported not to last very long.</P>

<H3>Wyse 60</H3>

<P> Display adjustments (must remove cover): Brightness VR202, Height
VR302, Width VR101 (also affects height).  If you want to use it in
Native Personality, then the arrow-key codes will conflict with the
codes used in vi (such as ^L).  To fix this set "Application key mode"
with ESC ~ 3.  This results in the arrow keys sending 0xd0 - 0xd3.
Due to a bug in the readline interface of the Bash shell, you need to
edit /etc/inputrc so that the arrow keys will work in Bash.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-17.html#bash_bug">Bugs in Bash</A></P>

<H3>Wyse 85</H3>

<P> Can emulate VT52/VT100/VT200.  Press F3 for setup.  After moving
left/right to go a menu "icon", press space to select it.  Scroll
thru setup menus with up/down keys.  Press F3 at any time to reenter
setup (without loosing any settings).</P>

<P> Here is the setup Menus of the Wyse99GT (late 1980's).  Note that
TERM means "termination" (character) and not "terminal".</P>

<P>HINTS on use of WY-99GT User's Guide:
Note that much that is missing from this Guide may be found in the
WY-99GT Programmer's Guide.  The VT100 emulation (personality) is
known as ANSI and uses ANSI key codes per p. A-10+ even though the
keyboard may be ASCII.  A sub-heading on p. A-13 "ASCII Keyboard" also
pertains to VT100 because it has an "ANSI KEY ..." super-heading a few
pages previously.  But not all ASCII keyboard headings pertain to
VT100 since they may fall under a non-ANSI personality super-heading
which may found be a few pages previously.  Appendix H is the "ANSI
Command Guide" except for the VT52 (ANSI) personality which is found
in Appendix G.</P>

<H3>Wyse 150</H3>

<P> When exiting set-up using F12, hitting space changes "no" to "yes"
to save the set-up.  The sentence to the left of this no/yes is about
"vertical alignment" and has nothing to do with this no/yes for saving
the set-up (confusing menu design).</P>

<H3>Wyse 185</H3>

<P>Has 10x20 character cells.  Can emulate DEC VT320.  Uses 45 watts power.
Later models were 185e.</P>

<H3>Low Emissions: -ES</H3>

<P>ES after the model number means low emissions: low magnetic field,
etc.</P>
