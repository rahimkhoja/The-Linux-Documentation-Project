<P>I use the same parallel port for printing on a printer and
networking with my laptop without big problems. It takes less than
one second to switch from printing to networking. I just add a cheap
manual switch between the parallel port, the printer and the
laptop. The cable between the switch and the desktop computer is a
fully connected one. The switch is just the one used to shared
printers when no network is available. It works.
<P>Sometimes, the kernel is not very happy because it can't finish its
network job. In that case, I shut down the plip interface and restart
it when needed.
<P>I bought a new parallel card last year but it is still in its
box. I'll write an "install a second parallel port" when I succeed
in opening the box and add that beautiful card in the last connector
I have left.
