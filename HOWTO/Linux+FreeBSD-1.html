<P>
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> is a free Unix-like
operating system much like Linux. The main difference is that, while the
Linux kernel has been written from scratch, FreeBSD is based on the freely
redistributable parts of 4.4BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) known as
4.4BSD-lite. This fact might lead some people to suggest that FreeBSD is
closer to being ``real'' UNIX&reg; than Linux. FreeBSD runs only on the
Intel PC platform (i386 and higher); ports to the DEC Alpha and Sun Sparc
platforms are being worked on at the moment. 
<A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> are
similar to FreeBSD, and both run on several platforms. Hardware requirements
for all these *BSD systems are similar to those for Linux.
<P>The development of FreeBSD is managed in a different way than the Linux
development. A core team of developers serve as arbitrators and provide
leadership for the project. Big changes are discussed in advance on the
mailing lists. The FreeBSD project has two development trees (just like
Linux): <B>``-CURRENT''</B> and <B>``-STABLE''</B>. The ``-CURRENT'' development
tree is where the development of new features happens. Development to the
``-STABLE'' tree are restricted to bug fixes and some thoroughly tested new
features.
<P>FreeBSD can be used and (re-)distributed freely just as Linux. Most parts of
the system are released under the BSD copyright; the rest is under the GNU GPL
or other 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">open-source</A> licences.
