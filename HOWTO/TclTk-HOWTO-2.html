<P>
<P>Tcl/Tk originated with
<A HREF="mailto:ouster@scriptics.com">Dr. John Ousterhout</A> (pronounced
"Oh'-stir-howt") while teaching at University of California, Berkeley, Califor
nia.
He actually started implementing it when he got back to Berkeley in the spring
of 1988; by summer of that year it was in use in some internal applications,
but there was no Tk. Read about the history of Tcl/Tk directly from its author
