>&#13;First of all , are you using the same kernel version on each machine ? 
The 'same-kernel' refers to the version. You can build different kernel 
images of the same source version to meet the hardware/software needs of a 
given node.
However you wil need toe make sure that when you install openMosix 
on your cluster, all your machines should have the openmosix-x.x.x-y 
kernel installed, in contrast to having one machine running 
openmosix-x.x.z-x, another running openmosix-x.x.x-y, another running 
openmosix x.x.x-z, and so on and so forth
&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;When you run mosmon, press t to see the total of machines running. Does 
it warn you that mosix is not running?</P
><P
>&#13;If yes, then make sure your machine's ip is included in /etc/mosix.map 
(don't use 127.0.0.1 - if your machine's ip is such, then you probably 
have problems with your dhcp server/nameserver). If it does not tell you 
that mosix is not running, see what machines show up. Do you see only your 
machine?</P
><P
>&#13;If yes, then your machine is most likely running a firewall and is not 
letting openmosix through.</P
><P
>&#13;If not, then the problem is most likely with the machine that doesn't show 
up.

Also: Do you have two nic cards on a node? then you have to edit the 
/etc/hosts file to have a line that has the following format

You 
might also 
need to set up a routing table, which is a whole different subject. </P
><P
>Maybe you used different kernel-parameters on each machine? Especially if 
you use the 'Support clusters with a complex network topology' option you 
should take care that you use the same value for the also appearing option 
'Maximum network-topology complexity support' on each machine.
