>4. More X Configuration</H1
><P
>&#13; Before taking a look at various configuration mechanisms for X servers and
 clients, it should be noted that the advent of Desktop Environments like 
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> have become popular in part because they can
 control much of the user interaction configuration themselves with nice, 
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"user friendly"</SPAN
> GUI controls. And in fact,
 the compliant applications that are part of the respective Desktops will be
 best configured through the Desktop's configuration tools, or the
 application's own GUI configuration methods. So, for instance,
 <B
CLASS="command"
>gtop</B
>, a <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
> client
 application, is best configured via <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
> or 
 <B
CLASS="command"
>gtop's</B
> own menus. But this is not true of all 
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> applications. 

</P
><DIV
CLASS="sect2"
><H2
CLASS="sect2"
><A
NAME="xresources"
></A
>4.1. X Resources</H2
><P
>&#13; The X server can store various configuration values for client programs
 so they are readily available when needed. If the application supports this,
 it will use these as defaults whenever that program is invoked. These are
 known as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Resources"</SPAN
>, and are often used to define user preferences
 on a per application basis for fonts, colors, screen placement (geometry) and
 various other attributes. This makes it easy to customize applications.

</P
><P
>&#13; Resources are specified as text strings (e.g. Netscape*blinkingEnabled:
 False) that can be read from disk in various places when
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is starting, or even interactively defined on the
 command line. Program components are named in a hierarchical fashion, with
 each object in the hierarchy identified by a class as well as an instance
 name. At the top level of the hierarchy is the class and instance name of the
 application itself. Typically, the class name of the application is the
 same as the program name, but with the first letter capitalized (e.g.  Vim or
 Emacs) although some programs that begin with the letter <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X"</SPAN
>
 also capitalize the second letter for historical reasons (e.g. XTerm). 
 Each definition  will specify a class (or instance), with corresponding
 resource and value. Below this in the hierarchy are the various attributes
 that make up the definable aspects of the application. 

</P
><P
>&#13; Traditionally, most <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> programs were  configured
 this way. This is not as true today with the advent of Desktop Environments
 which often have their own configuration mechanisms.

</P
><P
>&#13; As an example, say we prefer to run <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
> with a blue
 background. So if we run it from the command line, we would run it as:

>&#13;
 xterm -bg blue &#38;

 </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
</P
><P
>&#13; If this is our preference, it would be easier to put this preference in a
 file somewhere, and have the system use our preference. That way whenever we
 started <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
>, it would use our preferred value, and we 
 wouldn't need the command line options (unless as an override).

</P
><P
>&#13; The basic <SPAN
CLASS="application"

 </PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE

</P
><P
>&#13; It should be obvious what this does. The use of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"*"</SPAN
> in the
 definition, is called a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loose binding"</SPAN
> and acts as a 
 wild-card. Meaning there may be gaps in the widget hierarchy. For instance:

</P
><P
>&#13; This would also give a dark blue background for the <B

>xterm</B

 fontMenu, but also any other <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
> properties that also have a
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 where they may be in the widget hierarchy. Similarly:

></TR
></TABLE
>
</P
><P
>&#13; This would define the background for any and all programs that support it -- not just
 <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
>. Using a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"."</SPAN
> in place of a
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"*"</SPAN
> would be more precise, and will not allow for wild-card gaps
 in the hierarchy. Also, the application must support the particular widget 
 attribute. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Background"</SPAN
> is a fairly safe bet, but many
 applications will have more specialized resources that are not so obvious. It
 is best to check local documentation (man pages, etc), or see if an
 application has an included examples. For instance, <B
CLASS="command"
>Netscape</B
> 
 generally comes with an <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Netscape.ad</TT
> file that has an extensive 
 set of resource definitions that can be customized.

</P
><P
>&#13; <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> resources are typically stored in more than one
 place (see below) and are processed by the <B
CLASS="command"
>xrdb</B

>4.1.1. App Defaults</H3
><P
>&#13; One way of storing preferred application resources is via files named for the
 application in an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"app-defaults"</SPAN
> directory. For instance, on my
 system, these are in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/</TT
>,
 though this may vary according to options your vendor has chosen. This
 directory contains a number of files for such well known
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> applications as <B
CLASS="command"
>xterm</B
>,
 <B
CLASS="command"
>xclock</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>xcalc</B
>,
 <B
CLASS="command"
>xload</B
>, and so on. All in all, it is a relatively small 
 number of applications in the overall scheme of things. So not all
 applications use this scheme. In fact, most do not.

</P
><P
>&#13; Each file will contain resource definitions for that application. The X
 server loads these by itself during start up. A brief example from

>4.1.2. Xdefaults</H3

>&#13; Another common method of reading in resource preferences, is with an
 <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Xdefaults</TT
> file. Or, sometimes the naming 
 scheme may be <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Xresources</TT
> instead. This may exist as a
 system wide file, such as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/X11/Xresources</TT
>. 
 Of course, the user is free to create a personal version in his home
 directory, e.g. <TT
CLASS="filename"
>~/.Xdefaults</TT
>. The user's version will 
 over-ride any system wide settings, and will remain after system upgrades. 
 Obviously, this is the place to put your own preferences.

</P
><P
>&#13; <TT
CLASS="filename"

 with the <B

</P
><P
>&#13; This can be done interactively at the command line, or placed in a script and
 run automatically as the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> session is started. In
 the case of system wide files, this should be taken care of by the vendor
 supplied start up scripts. Generally, such scripts will also check the user's
 home directory as well (see the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>xinitrc</TT
> example above).
 So probably all that need be done, is to create the file with a text editor.

</P

 that <B

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"BackSpace"</SPAN

 And should also give you an idea of how <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
>
 understands key and mouse events. There are two keysyms per keycode. The
 second is the shifted value. XFree86's <B
CLASS="command"
>xev</B
> utility can be
 used to dump a lot of information on key-presses and mouse events
 interactively. Pay attention to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"keycode"</SPAN
> value. That is
 what you will need to know in order to re-map.

</P
><P
>&#13; <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> is often used to make minor keyboard adjustments,
 like proper Backspace/Delete mapping. Or can be used make major adjustments
 such as for international mappings. You can only re-map keys and mouse events
 -- you cannot assign macros to key events (your Window Manager or Desktop
 might have some of this functionality).

>&#13;  As mentioned, Linux and Unix make heavy use of three mouse buttons. If a
  mouse only has two buttons, then the third (i.e. the middle) button can
  be simulated by pressing both buttons simultaneously. This is a
  configuration option set in <TT

>&#13; When all is said and done, a third button is quite handy and I would personally recommend
 having one. On wheeled mice, the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 button, if pressed. Many standard wheel mice seem to work with the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

</P

>&#13; Specifically, the third button (middle) is the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"paste"</SPAN
> button in
 virtually all Linux applications. Copy and paste works a little different in
 Linux. The left button is the copy button. Just hold it down, and drag over
 text. It is automatically copied to the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clipboard"</SPAN
>. Then, the middle button will paste from there. A
 very simple process. A double-click should copy individual words, and a
 triple-click individual lines of text. If for some reason, this does not
 work, it is either a poorly implemented application, or a bug of some kind.
 Some older versions of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>Netscape</SPAN
> were not
 consistent about this, for instance. To paste from the keyboard, this should 
 be shift+insert.

</P
><P
>&#13; <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Drag and Drop"</SPAN
> is not natively supported by
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> itself. But, is implemented by some toolkits and
 Desktop Environments. One should not expect this to work with non-compliant
 applications (i.e non-<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> aware applications in 
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN

CLASS="command"

 preferences. <B
CLASS="command"
>xset</B

 to change various, unrelated X server settings. Mostly this is a command 
 line way of configuring some of the same things that are defined in 
 <TT

> (but not everything!).

</P
><P
>&#13; Common usages of <B
CLASS="command"
>xset</B

 preferred intervals, to dynamically change the FontPath or re-read it, to
 control keyboard LEDs, to adjust mouse (or other pointer) movement speed,
 set keyboard <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"autorepeat"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"repeat"</SPAN

 to control <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X's</SPAN

 man page, of course, for detailed explanations, and other
 <B

</P
><P
>&#13; Again, <B
CLASS="command"
>xset</B

 line. But most often preferred settings are stored in one of the start up 
 configuration files, like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.xinitrc</TT

 <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.xsession</TT
