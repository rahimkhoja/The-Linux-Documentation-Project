>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>&#13; The <EM
>X Window System</EM
> is an advanced, graphical
 computing and network environment that was designed from the ground up as a
 multi-user system. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> was first released in 1984.
 If you are not familiar with the basic concepts surrounding
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> and it's related components, you should first
 read the <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>X Window System Architecture Overview HOWTO</I
>, <A
HREF="http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html</A
>,
 to get an idea of how the various pieces fit together. There is also 
 an attempt to define to various <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> related
 terminology in the <A
HREF="appendix.html#terms"
>Appendix</A
>, if concepts such 
 as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"displays"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X clients"</SPAN
> in this context are
 confusing to you.

</P
><P
>&#13; This document will address basic X Window configuration and usage on Linux. We will
 also look at how <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is commonly started in Linux,
 and how the start up can be configured, and related issues. We will
 <EM
>not</EM
> examine Window Manager (e.g.
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>fvwm</SPAN
>), or Desktop Environment
 (<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
>)
 configuration. There are just too many variables there, and the pace of
 change moves too quickly. Of course, to a large extent the user interacts
 more directly with these components than the X server itself, so additional
 reading would be worthwhile. Check your locally installed documentation, and
 the respective home pages for more information.

</P
><P
>&#13; Some other important points to remember here:

</P
><P
>&#13; <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is a client-server, multi-user system in
    every respect, and not just a GUI.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is not integrated into the operating system,
   and rides on top of it, like other servers.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;   <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> is an open standard, and runs on many platforms. 
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    What you actually see on the screen is the result of various components,
    all working together: operating system, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>,
    Window Manager, and optionally, a desktop environment like
    <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>GNOME</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>KDE</SPAN
>. These
    are all <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"plug and play"</SPAN
> components, meaning you can
    interchange an individual component without touching the other components.
    
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Each of the various components has its own configuration. This makes for a
    very flexible, and potentially very robust, system. It also adds 
    complexity.
  </P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>&#13; The discussion here will be limited to <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> as
 implemented by <A
HREF="http://xfree86.org"
TARGET="_top"
>The XFree86 Project,
 Inc.</A
> on Linux. There are other implementations, including
 commercial ones. XFree86 v4.x has been out for some time now, so we will be
 assuming that version. Much of the discussion applies to the previous 3.x
 version as well, but there are some occasional differences.

</P
><P
>&#13; It is also worth noting that there are conceivably many ways to start
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
>, and to set up a Linux system. We will focus on
 the common methods found in Linux distributions. Also, vendors may vary on
 where they put configuration files, and how they name them. Keep this in mind
 if you see such discrepancies in this document. If this is a problem, your
 vendor surely has their own documentation. And as always, hopefully the man
 pages will conform to your installation.

</P
><P
>&#13; Also, we will look at various configuration files in the following sections.
 These are all plain text files, and can be edited with your favorite editor.
 Always make a backup copy before editing important files, in case Murphy pays
 a visit (e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"cp /etc/X11/XF86Config-4  /etc/X11/XF86Config-4.bak"</SPAN
>).

><P
>&#13; 
The <A
HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>current official version of this HOWTO </A
>
may be found at the Linux Documentation Project.
</P
><P
>&#13; v3.1: This is just some small, minor updates. Include link 
 to <A
HREF="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.plig.org/xwinman/</A
>
 as a good resource for shopping Window Managers. Add link for fluxbox, 
 a Window Manager with Tabbed windows. And add a brief section on improving 
 network performance. Verify links all work.
</P
><P
>&#13; v3.0: This is a major rewrite with several new sections. Some
 sections were removed, with the focus more now on just
 <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>X</SPAN
> itself (and not clients like Window Managers).
 New maintainer too :-)
</P
><P
>&#13; v2.0: includes corrections from Guus Bosch, Brian J.
 Miller, and myself, as well as lots of new updates and info.
</P
><P
>&#13; v1.4: include corrections and additions from Anthony J., and
 some very good security tips from Tomasz Motylewski.

>1.4. Help!</H2
><P
>&#13; I have assumed maintainership of this document because it was abandoned, and
 I had wanted to offer a suggested change. Well, to make a long story short,
 this led to a major re-write. You can help make this a better document by
 correcting inaccuracies, clarifying the unclear, and suggesting improvements.
 There is much about this topic I may not know, or not have explained well. Your
 help will improve this document and help other users. This document 
 <EM
>needs</EM
> your help!
