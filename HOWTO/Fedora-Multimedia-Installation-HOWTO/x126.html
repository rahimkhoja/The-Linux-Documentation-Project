>3. Security considerations and other risks</H1
><P
>All the yum commands I give in this HOWTO have to be run from the
root prompt so the packages they fetch can be installed in your system
space.  This means there is a risk that your system could be compromised by
a Trojan Horse RPM, either one inserted in one of the repositories you
query or one slipped to you by a man-in-the-middle attack getting between
you and a repository.</P
><P
>To control the latter risk, many repositories cryptographically sign
their RPMs.  You need to have a local copy of each repository's public key
in order to integrity-check incoming packages; current versions of yum will
dowmload one for you.  This could be defeated by a man-in-the-middle attack
spoofing the repo site and slipping you bogus keys as you set up your
configuration; while this possibility is extremely unlikely, you should be
aware of it.</P
><P
>A long-term risk that you accept by using the proprietary code
referenced in this HOWTO is that of becoming dependent on the whims of a
proprietary software vendor.  It isn't necessary to have that old-time Free
Software religion to see that this is a problem.  Some of the software
we'll cover here (the Sun Java JDK plugin is a good example) is
distributed as closed-source freeware &#8212; which is all very well, but
what happens if the vendor changes its mind in the future?  You could be
stranded.</P
><P
>It's unsafe to be dependent on proprietary software and proprietary
formats.  When you allow yourself to be dependent, you also harm others by
helping vendors maintain an unhealthy monopoly lock on their market
segment.  So, if you must buy into these tools, please find some way to
support open-source replacements &#8212; donate coding time or cash, or
spend effort pressuring vendors to open up.  Rip your CDs to Ogg Vorbis
rather than MP3.  Write a letter to your legislator urging repeal of the
DMCA.  The freedom you save <EM
>will</EM
> be your own.</P
