>In previous sections, I have thrown away a lot of DocBook's
history.  XML has an older brother,
SGML or Standard Generalized
Markup Language.</P
><P
>Until mid-2002, no discussion of DocBook would have been
complete without a long excursion into SGML, the differences between
SGML and XML, and detailed descriptions of the SGML DocBook toolchain.
Life can be simpler now; an XML DocBook toolchain is available in open
source, works as well as the SGML toolchain ever did, and is much
easier to use.  If you don't think you'll ever have to deal with old
SGML-Docbook documents, you can skip the remainder of this
section.</P

>13.1. DocBook SGML</H2
><P
>DocBook was originally an SGML application, and there was an
SGML-based DocBook toolchain that is now moribund.  There are minor
differences between the DocBook SGML DTD and the DocBook XML DTD, but
for an introductory discussion we can ignore them. The only one that's
normally user-visible is that in SGML contentless tags did not need to
have a trailing slash added to them before the closing &#62;.
(Requiring the trailing / means XML parsers can be a lot simpler,
because they don't have to know about the DTD to know which opening
tags need closers.)</P
><P
>Versions of HTML up to 4.01 (before XHTML) were SGML
applications.  TEI was originally an SGML application, too.  The
groups managing all three DTDs jumped to XML for the same reason
DocBook's developers did &#8212; it's drastically simpler.  SGML was
extremely complex; unmanageably so, as it turns out.  The
specification was a dense 150 pages and it is not reliably reported
that any software ever fully implemented it.</P
><P
>The toolchain diagram I gave earlier was simplified; it
only showed the XML toolchain.  Here is the historically
correct version:</P

>The DSSSL toolchain is what processed DocBook SGML.
Under it, a document goes from DocBook format through one of two
closely-related stylesheet engines called Jade and OpenJade.  These
turn it into a TeX-macro markup, which is processed by a package called
JadeTeX, into DVIs, which then get turned into Postscript.</P

>13.3. Why SGML DocBook is dead</H2
><P
>The DSSSL toolchain is, as far as new development goes,
effectively dead.  The XSLT toolchain has reached production status in
mid-2002; a working version shipped in Red Hat 7.3.  It's where
DocBook developers are putting almost all of their effort.</P
><P
>The reason for the change to XML was threefold.  First,
SGML turned out to be too complicated to use; then, DSSSL turned out
to be too complicated to live with; then, significant parts of the
DSSSL toolchain turned out to be weak and irredeemably messy.</P
><P
>Relative to SGML, XML has a reduced feature set that is
sufficient for almost all purposes but much easier to understand and
build parsers for.  SGML-processing tools (such as validating parsers) have
to carry around support for a lot of features that DocBook and other
text markup systems never actually used.  Removing these features
made XML simpler and XML-processing tools faster.</P
><P
>The language used to describe SGML DTDs is sufficiently spiky
and forbidding that composing SGML DTDs was something of a black art.
XML DTDs, on the other hand, can be described in a dialect of XML
itself; there does not need to be a separate DTD language. An XML
description of an XML DTD is called a
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>schema</I
>;
the term DTD itself will probably pass out of use as the standards for
schemas firm up.</P
><P
>But mostly the DSSSL toolchain is dead because DSSSL itself, the
SGML stylesheet description language in that toolchain, proved just too
arcane for most human beings, and made stylesheets too difficult to
write and modify. (It was a dialect of Scheme.  Your humble editor, a
LISP-head from way back, shakes his head in sad bemusement that
this should drive people away.)</P

>13.4. SGML-Tools</H2
><P
>SGML-Tools was the name of a DTD used by the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Documentation Project</A
>,
developed a few years ago when today's DocBook toolchains didn't exist.
SGML-Tools markup was simpler, but also much less flexible than
DocBook.  The original SGML-Tools formatter/DTD/stylesheet(s)
toolchain has been dead for some time now, but a successor called <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sgmltools-lite/"
TARGET="_top"
>SGML-tools
Lite</A
> is still maintained.</P
><P
>The LDP has been phasing out SGML-Tools in favor of DocBook, but
it is still possible you might take over an old HOWTO.  These can be
recognized by the identifying header "&#60;!doctype linuxdoc
system&#62;". If this happens to you, convert the thing to XML DocBook
and give the old version a quick burial.</P
