>2. Why care about DocBook at all?</H1
><P
>There are two possibilities that make DocBook really
interesting.  One is <EM
>multi-mode rendering</EM
> and the
other is <EM
>searchable documentation
databases</EM
>.</P
><P
>Multi-mode rendering is the easier, nearer-term possibility; it's
the ability to write a document in a single master format that can be
rendered in many different display modes (in particular, as both HTML
for on-line viewing and as Postscript for high-quality printed
output).  This capability is pretty well implemented now.</P
><P
><EM
>Searchable documentation databases</EM
> is
shorthand for the possibility that DocBook might help get us to a
world in which all the documentation on your open-source operating
system is one rich, searchable, cross-indexed and hyperlinked
database (rather than being scattered across several different formats
in multiple locations as it is now).</P
><P
>Ideally, whenever you install a software package on your machine
it would register its DocBook documentation into your system's
catalog.  HTML, properly indexed and cross-linked to the HTML in the
rest of your catalog, would be generated.  The new package's
documentation would then be available through your browser.  All your
documentation would be searchable through an interface resembling a
good Web search engine.</P
><P
>HTML itself is not quite rich enough a format to get us to that
world.  To name just one lack, you can't explicitly declare index
entries in HTML.  DocBook <EM
>does</EM
> have the semantic
richness to support structured documentation databases.  Fundamentally
that's why so many projects are adopting it.</P
><P
>DocBook has the vices that go with its virtues.  Some people
find it unpleasantly heavyweight, and too verbose to be really
comfortable as a composition format.  That's OK; as long as the markup
tools they like (things like asciidoc or Perl POD or GNU Texinfo) can
generate DocBook out their back ends, we can all still get what we
want.  It doesn't matter whether or not everybody writes in DocBook
&#8212; as long as it becomes the common document interchange format
that everyone uses, we'll still get unified searchable documentation
databases.</P
