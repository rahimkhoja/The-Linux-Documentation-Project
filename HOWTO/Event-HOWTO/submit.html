>    Once you have the basic idea of what you want to present, you have
    to get it accepted by groups and get the opportunity to show it.
    Your best line of strategy is to start off giving your intended
    presentation to a local LUG and let them critique it.  Audience
    feedback is cruicial, especially if you have not done a presentation
    before.
  </P
><P
>    So what's the secret for talking to a LUG?  In many cases, just offer.
    LUGs like to have speakers for each meeting to give a reason
    to get together other than go for a beer after the meeting.

>    In terms of conferences that you would like to attend, check the major
    conferences and expos out there.  Many are listed at Linux web sites,
    some send out a call for papers (CFP) to approprate discussion lists,
    like <TT
CLASS="EMAIL"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org"
>ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org</A
>&#62;</TT
>.  Many will have
    either an e-mail CFP, or have you fill out a web form.
  </P
><P
>    The author cannot comment on what papers are accepted or declined, mostly
    because I don't know how it works.  The best I can say is to see what
    topics have been selected in the past and tailor your abstract that way.
  </P
><P
>    Assuming your presentation has been selected, try and get some information
    about the location, dates, time, and so on.  This will have a lot of bearing
    on how your presentation is laid out. A presentaton using printed slides
    will appear different on screen than one with an LCD projector that
    connects to your laptop.  In some cases, you will need to bring your
    own laptop to the presentation.
