>5.1. Correcting the file protection modes</H2
><P
>      During the installation process of the releases up to and including 6.2, 
      some programs are run directly off the CD. Unfortunately, the FTP program 
      does not always preserve the protection modes of the files and directories 
      that are copied. Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that execute 
      permission is given to programs, shell scripts and shared libraries, before 
      the directory is burned on the CD. This is done by running the 
      <A
HREF="rhcd-scripts/updatePerm.sh"
TARGET="_top"
>      updatePerm.sh</A
> script on your local copy of the distribution. 
      It is really needed only for version 6.2 and older, the only part useful to 
      the 7.3/8.0/9 releases procedure is the directories permissions update, even if the 
      rest won't hurt and things are kept coherent. It is almost equal to the 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>updatePerm</TT
> script included in the previous version of  
      the howto, just some slight changes were made. Before using this script you 
      have to configure the 
      <A

TARGET="_top"
>      rhcd.conf</A
> configuration file and export a <EM

        Actually, it is more up-to-date! Therefore, if you attempt to mirror the 
        distribution using mirror, older versions of the RPM's that have been updated 
        will be downloaded once more, and the updates deleted. The bash/wget based 
        procedure doesn't suffer from the problem, but will leave the main tree in an 
        incoherent state. Old and new packages will be in this case mixed together, but 
        you can find and remove them wrapping the <TT

        simple shell script (which I will leave as an exercise for the reader...).

>      Things have  changed pretty much in this section with the introduction of the 
      anaconda installer (as of release 6.1) and with the considerable increment 
      in size (and ... number of CDs) the 7.x/8.0 distributions have seen. Until 
      release 6.2, the only step composing this section was represented by 
      generating a new <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hdlist</TT
> file. With release 6.2, this 
      appears to be true only to a certain extent, because of the changes in the 
      anaconda installer, in the  <EM
>rpm</EM
> software itself 
      (from version 3.x to 4.x) and the migration of the updated packages to 
      this new version (updates for release 6.2 are in fact packaged with both 
      major releases of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rpm</TT
> software). We will consider 
      three different procedures trying to cover all the releases.

        The introduction of version 4 of the Redhat Package Manager (RPM), made the 
        procedure to update the anaconda installer fail. So the procedures listed will 
        work only if the updated packages were built using a version of the RPM 
        software which is older than or equal to 3.0.4 (so, basically, 3.0.4 or 3.0.5).
      </P
><P
>        If you are using the original packages from Redhat, you have to avoid using 
        updates released after 28 March 2001 (which is a bit useless, in my opinion) 
        or you have to rebuild the packages using the old rpm format. Details on the 
        downgrade procedure and tools which implement it can be found in the document 
        <A
HREF="http://www.tigress.co.uk/rmy/rh62/rpmhack.html"
TARGET="_top"
>rpmhack</A
>.
        I have not personally tested this procedure, even if it appears to work if you 
        read about it on the anaconda-devel and kickstart mailing lists (you can find 
        them on the <A
HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo"
TARGET="_top"
>mailing 
        lists</A
> section of the Redhat website. 
      </P
><P
>        If you decide to stick to the old original packages and complete the update 
        (using the rpm 4.0.2 packages after the installation is finished) 
        there are two possible ways of doing it, depending on which kind of updates you
        want to complete the CD with. If some of the updates regard directly the 
        installation process (e.g. kernel, python, kudzu), you will have to use the 
        installer rebuilding procedure explained in the document
        <A
HREF="http://www.scyld.com/~pzb/rhcd.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Building a Red Hat Linux 6.2 
        CDROM</A
>, otherwise you can still use the old procedure (the one for 
        releases previous to and including 6.1 explained in the previous section).    
        The last two steps, which are, respectively, creating the iso image and burning 
        the actual media are described in <A
HREF="include-updates.html#ISO-IMAGE-CREATE"
>Creating the CD iso image</A

        uptodate series of CDs. Exactly, they have become more than one with release 7.0 
        and now the tree has to be split to fit on the media. This is done by means of 
        the <TT

           between 7.3, 8.0 and 9 for this execution of the program
           The command to issue is the following:

           As you can see, there are two new options passed to the program, if you remember 
           the first run of it. The first one, <EM
>--fileorder</EM
>, tells genhdlist 
           to use the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgorder.txt</TT
> we generated in the second 
           step (rebuild the installer). This file keeps informations on how the packages 
           were split on the different CDs and is used by the installer to determine in which 
           order the packages should be installed. Basically, if you avoid using it, you will 
           (probably) end up swapping the various CDs many times during the installation. 
           The <EM
>--withnumbers</EM
> option is needed to associate a CD number to 
           every package (as you can see, a wildcard indicating the first 3 iso images is 
           used).

>          Here you will prepare the iso images to be burned on the actual CDs. There are 
          two different commands to be used for the first disc and for the rest of them. 
          This is due to the need of obtaining a first CD which is bootable. This is 
          actually, not strictly necessary, because you could use a boot floppy instead 
          of it, but it's definitely a nifty feature (and makes your discs more similar 
          in behaviour to the original ones). These are the commands I use to complete 
          the task:

            This is needed to burn the first (bootable) disc for RedHat 8.0 and 9 (with no floppy

            The loop just presented will prepare the last four images giving them the 
            correct numbers. As you can see, there are just two missing options from the 
            first run, and, as you can guess, they are needed only to create a bootable 
            CD. In <A
HREF="include-updates.html#ISO-IMAGE-CREATE"
>Creating the CD iso image</A
>, you can read a brief explanation of 
            the various options and their meanings (most of it was extracted from the man page).
	    Again if you are building a Redhat 8.0 you should change the volume name to read 
	    "Red Hat 8.0 (Psyche) disc ${i}".
