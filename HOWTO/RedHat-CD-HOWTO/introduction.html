>    There may be several reasons for making your own CDs. Perhaps you're a
    cheapskate and want to save the cost of the 
    <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Red Hat distribution</A
>. Or, perhaps 
    you want to include in your CDs the latest distribution with all the current
    updates. This is highly relevant, because after each major release of the
    Red Hat distribution, there have been loads of updates, several of which
    are security related. Just take a look at the
    <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/corp/support/errata"
TARGET="_top"
>errata page</A
>. 
    Or maybe you want to customize the default installation adding a few 
    packages not present in the default tree and unselecting the installation 
    of some packages which are otherwise included in the default setup.

>    This is what you will be taught in the next sections (hopefully). I will use the 
    i386 architecture and releases 7.3, 8.0 and 9 of the distribution in the examples. The 
    notes related to the previous releases (&#60;=6.1) were contained in a previous version of 
    this document and were compiled by the original authors. The notes related to release 
    6.2 are based on tests I've not completed (and I don't know if I ever will) and some 
    documents you can find linked in the <A
HREF="this-document.html#RELATED-DOC"
>Related documentation</A
> section. 
    The procedure given in the following sections for RedHat 7.3 and 8.0 is likely to work 
    on all platforms supported by Red Hat (Alpha, ppc, etc.), for all the 7.x (and maybe 8.x/9 
    in a not too far future) releases, but I have only tested it on the i386 platform with 
    Redhat Linux 7.3, 8.0 and 9 (I would be interested in additional information).
