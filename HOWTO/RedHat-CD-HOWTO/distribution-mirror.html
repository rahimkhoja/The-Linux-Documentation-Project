>4. Obtaining your local copy of the distribution</H1
><P
>    You need a copy of the distribution on a writable disk which is accessible
    from the computer having the CD writer (duh!). If you want to incorporate
    the latest updates, this directory should (also) be accessible from a Linux 
    machine, either from a local disk, an NFS mounted disk on a different
    computer, or a JAZ disk.
    You could copy the distribution from the RedHat CDs (recommended), or you 
    could get it via FTP. If you choose to use FTP, there are two ways of doing 
    it.  You can use the <EM
>wget</EM
> based shell script 
    presented in the  following section or the <EM
>mirror</EM
> 
    package as suggested in versions up to and including  1.34 of the howto 
    (reported in section <A
HREF="distribution-mirror.html#USING-MIRROR"
>Using mirror</A
>).

      This is not the simplest, even if, probably, the most accurate way. I like it because 
      it works comparing the RPM versions of the files and not the dates/times or names 
      (like the standard mirroring packages) and it checks the signatures of the 
      updates each time it downloads some of them if configured to do so by means of the 
      <EM
>CHECKSIG</EM
> variable in the 
      <A

TARGET="_top"
>rhcd.conf</A
