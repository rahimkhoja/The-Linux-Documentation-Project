<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Communications using PSTN line</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>VoIP becomes very interesting when you start to use PSTN lines
to call other people in the world, directly to their home telephone.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Scenario</A>
</H2>

<P>A typical application is like that:
<P>
<PRE>
Home telephone1 -- (PSTN) -- PC1 -- (Internet) -- PC2 -- (PSTN) -- Home telephone2
</PRE>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Home Telephone1 make a calls to PC1 phone number (using PSTN
line, I mean classic telephone line).</LI>
<LI>PC1 answer to it.</LI>
<LI>Home telephone1 must tell PC1 what gateway use (PC2 in this case)
by giving the IP address (from DTMF keyboard) and/or what number
call (in this case Home telephone2).</LI>
<LI>After that PC1 will start to make an H323 call to PC2, then it
will pass Home telephone2 to PC2 to make it call it throught PSTN
line.</LI>
<LI>Home telephone2 answers to call and communication between Home
telephone1 and Home telephone2 begins.</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 What can be changed in this configuration? </A>
</H2>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>You may use a PBX to select many lines to access many PC1 gateway
(for example one to call within your state, one to go accross Europe,
and so on...): typically you don't have to change this, cause cost
is always the same.</LI>
<LI>You can select (after called your PC1 gateway) every PC2 you
want (for example a PC2 living in England to call an English person
so that you'd pay only intra-country costs).</LI>
</OL>
<P>So your decision will be taken considering PSTN line costs. In
fact what VoIP does is the convert this:
<P>
<PRE>
Home Telephone1 --- (PSTN) --- Home Telephone2
             PSTN great distance calling cost
</PRE>
<P>into this:
<P>
<PRE>
      Home Telephone1 --- (PSTN) --- PC1   +
      PC2 ---- (PSTN) --- Home Telephone2  =
      --------------------------------------
          2 PSTN short distance calling costs
</PRE>
<P>To save money you need that:
<P>
<PRE>
2 PSTN short distance calling costs &lt; PSTN great distance calling cost 
</PRE>
<P>Typically "short distance calling" refers to a "city cal" while "great
distance calling" can be an "intercontinental call"!
