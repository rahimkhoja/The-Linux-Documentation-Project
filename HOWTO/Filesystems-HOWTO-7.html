<P>All Macintosh storage devices except floppy disks are partitioned into
one or more volumes. Volumes can contain four kinds of items: files,
directories, directory threads and file threads. Each item is described
by a catalog record which is analogous to a Unix inode. Catalog records
are organized in the on-disk catalog B-Tree. Directory contents are
derived from searching the catalog B-Tree. Only a file can occupy space
outside of its catalog record.</P>

<P>A Macintosh "file" contains two components,
or forks. The resource fork is an indexed file containing code
segments, menu items, dialog boxes, etc. The data fork has the "stream of
bytes" semantics of a Unix file contents. Each fork is comprised of one
or more extents or contiguous runs of blocks. An extent descriptor encodes
an extent's starting block and length into a 32bit quantity. The first
extent record (three extent descriptors) of each fork is a part of the
file's catalog record. Any further extent records are kept in the
extents overflow B-Tree.</P>

<P>In addition to file and B-Tree extents a volume also contains two boot
blocks, a volume information block, and a free space bitmap. There is
a remarkable amount of redundancy in the on diskdata structures which
improves crash recovery. While not strictly a part of the filesystem,
it should be noted that several catalog record fields are reserved
for the exclusive use of Finder, a program which handles user access
to the filesystem and automatically maintains associations between
applications and data files. Thus, HFS must also maintain this Finder
info. </P>

<P>Every file and directory on an HFS volume has an identification number,
similar to an inode number in the Unix filesystem. However, a file or
directory is named by its parent's identification number and the file
or directory's file name, which is a 32 character string that can
contain nulls. This combination is the search key to the volume's
catalog B-Tree. The catalog B-Tree differs from a traditional B-Tree
structure in that all the nodes at each level of the B-Tree are linked
together to form a doubly linked list and all of the records are in
the leaf nodes. These variations permit accessing many items in the
same directory by traversing the leaves using the linked list. Strictly
speaking, the HFS B-Trees are a variant of B+-Trees although Apple's
technical documentation calls them B*-Trees. </P>

<P>Each directory, including the root directory, contains its directory
thread, which has the empty filename. The directory thread record
contains the name of the directory and the id of the parent of the directory.
Similarly, filethreads contain the name of a file and the id of the
directory they are in. While every directory must contain a directory
thread, file threads are very uncommon. In fact, both are examples of
HFS redundancy - for undamaged trees, threads are not strictly necessary.
Both file and directory records contain 32 bytes of information used by
Finder. The first three extent descriptors for the catalog B-Tree are kept
in the volume information block. If the catalog B-Tree file grows beyond
three extents, the remaining extent descriptors are kept in the extents
overfow.</P>

<P>HFS and HFS+ (also called Sequoia) filesystems are well documented. The
best source of tech. information about HFS can be found in the <B>Inside
Macintosh</B> series of books. Look at

The HFS+ filesystem is described in <B>Technote 1150</B>,

This is a Macintosh file system library which is portable to a
variety of operating systems and platforms. It presents a programming
interface sufficient for creating a user level API as well as file system
drivers for operating systems that support them. Authors implemented
and tested such a user level API and utility programs based on it
as well as an experimental Unix Virtual File System.
They also describe the Macintosh Hierarchical File System and their
implementation and note that
the design is not well suited to reentrancy and that its complex
data structures can lead to slow
implementations in multiprogrammed environments. Performance
measurements show that
our implementation is faster than the native Macintosh
implementation at creating, deleting,
reading and writing files with small request sizes, but slower than the Berkeley Fast File
System (FFS.) However, the native Macintosh implementation can
perform large read and write operations faster that either our
implementation or FFS.</P>
