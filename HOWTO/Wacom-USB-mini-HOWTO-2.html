<P>This document is a guide to getting your Wacom Graphire USB tablet to working
with Linux. Beware, this is a quite difficult task, but this guide will guide
you, step-by-step, through the process.
<P>This work is mainly derived from the Wacom Tablet HOWTO by Stephan Runkel,
but brings some precisions about all the USB configuration that is absent from
the original document. If you want more precision about general Wacom Tablets,
please read Stephan Runkel's HOWTO.
<P>I have written this document because I've had many difficulties in setting
up my brand new Graphire tablet with Linux, but now it works quite well on
my Toshiba 4030CDT Laptop.

<P>I wish to thank everyone that work on the USB part of the kernel, and special

helped me much in the configuration process.

<P>The information in this document is correct to the best of my knowledge,
but there's a always a chance I've made some mistakes, so don't follow everything
too blindly, especially if it seems wrong. Nothing here should have a detrimental
effect on your computer, but just in case I take no responsibility for any
damages incurred from the use of the information contained herein.This document
is not a kernel howto, so I'll take the assumption that you know how to download/install
a new kernel, and how to configure/compile it.
