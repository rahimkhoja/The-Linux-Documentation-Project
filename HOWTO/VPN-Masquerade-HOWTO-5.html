<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Testing</A>
</H2>

<P>To test VPN Masquerade:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Bring up your ISP connection from your Linux box and verify that it
still works properly.
</LI>
<LI>Verify that regular masquerading still works properly by, for
example, trying to browse a Web site or access an FTP server from a
masqueraded box on your local network.
</LI>
<LI>PPTP: Verify that you have masquerading of the PPTP control channel
properly configured: try to telnet from the PPTP client system to port 1723
on your PPTP server. Don't expect to see anything, but if you get a timeout
or an error saying the connection failed, take a look at the masquerade
rules on your Linux box to ensure that you are indeed masquerading traffic
from your PPTP client to TCP port 1723 on your PPTP server.
</LI>
<LI>PPTP: Attempt to establish a PPTP connection. I recommend you also run
<CODE>RASMON</CODE> if it is available, as this will give you a minimal amount
of information about the status of the connection. If you establish a
PPTP connection on the first try, congratulations! You're done!
</LI>
<LI>IPsec: Attempt to establish an IPsec connection.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Possible problems</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several things that may prevent a VPN session from being established.
We'll work through them going from the client to the server and back again.
We will assume you're using a Windows-based client for the examples, as that's
the most common case.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Connect information: the &quot;telephone number&quot; in the VPN dialup
configuration must be the Internet IP address of the VPN server, or the IP
address of the firewall if the server is being masqueraded.
</LI>
<LI>PPTP and strong encryption: unless both client and server have the
128-bit <CODE>NDISWAN.SYS</CODE> or W'95/'98 PPTP software, you will not be able
to establish a strongly-encrypted session. Unfortunately in my experience
this problem does not generate any obvious error messages, it just keeps
trying and trying and trying... The strong encryption update can be
obtained from the Microsoft secure site URL given in the &quot;Configuring
a MS Client&quot; section.
<P>This may also affect IPsec clients, if they use the MS-supplied encryption
libraries rather than using their own libraries.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Routing: verify that the default route on your VPN client is pointing
at the Linux masquerade box. Run the <CODE>route print</CODE> command and look
for an <CODE>0.0.0.0</CODE> entry.
<P>If other masqueraded services (such as HTTP, FTP, IRC, etc.) work from
your VPN client system then this probably is not the problem.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Masquerading: there are two parts to the VPN session.
<P>For IPsec, the authentication and key exchange service (ISAKMP), which is a
normal UDP session to port 500 on the remote IPsec host, must be configured
for masquerading as you would any other UDP service (such as DNS).
<P>For PPTP, the control channel, which is a normal TCP session to port 1723
on the PPTP server, must be configured for masquerading as you would any
other TCP service (such as HTTP).
<P>The encrypted data channel in IPsec is carried over ESP, IP protocol 50.
The encrypted data channel in PPTP is carried over GRE, IP protocol 47.
(Note that these are <EM>not</EM> TCP or UDP port numbers!)
Since the 2.0 Linux kernel only lets you specify <CODE>TCP</CODE>,
<CODE>UDP</CODE>, <CODE>ICMP</CODE> and <CODE>ALL</CODE> IP protocols when creating
masquerade rules, you must also masquerade <CODE>ALL</CODE> protocol traffic if
you are masquerading only specific services. If you are masquerading
everything, you don't need to worry about this.
<P>In order to isolate the firewall rules from the kernel masquerade code,
try establishing a VPN connection with your firewall completely open, then
if it works, tighten the firewall rules.
<P>2.0.x ipfwadm completely open firewall:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ipfwadm -I -p accept
ipfwadm -O -p accept
ipfwadm -F -a accept -m
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>2.2.x ipchains completely open firewall:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ipchains -P input   ACCEPT
ipchains -P output  ACCEPT
ipchains -P forward MASQ
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Do <EM>not</EM> leave your firewall completely open for any longer than
it takes to prove that a masqueraded VPN connection can be established!
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Intermediary hops and the Internet:
All routers between your Linux firewall and the remote IPsec host must
forward packets carrying IP protocol 50.
All routers between your Linux firewall and the PPTP server must forward
packets carrying IP protocol 47.
If you had IPsec or PPTP working when your VPN client system directly
dialled your ISP then this probably is not the problem.
<P>To isolate whether an intermediary hop is blocking GRE traffic, use a
patched <CODE>traceroute</CODE> to trace the progress of GRE packets. See the
resources section for information on the traceroute patch. A similar patch
for ESP is in the works.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The remote firewall: the firewall at the server end must allow a
system with the IP address assigned to your Linux box by your ISP to
connect to port 500/udp on the IPsec host or port 1723/tcp on the PPTP
server. If you had the VPN working when your VPN client system directly
dialled your ISP then this probably is not the problem.
</LI>
<LI>The server firewall and ESP: the IPsec encrypted data is carried
over IP protocol 50. If the firewall the remote IPsec host is behind does
not forward ESP traffic in both directions, IPsec will not work. Again, if
you had IPsec working when your IPsec client system directly dialled your
ISP then this probably is not the problem.
</LI>
<LI>The server firewall and GRE: the PPTP data channel is carried as a
GRE-encapsulated (IP protocol 47) PPP session. If the firewall your PPTP
server is behind does not forward GRE traffic in both directions, PPTP will
not work. Again, if you had PPTP working when your PPTP client system
directly dialed your ISP then this probably isn't the problem.
</LI>
<LI>The patch: If your IPsec client successfully authenticates you but
cannot establish a network connection, the patch may not be masquerading
ESP traffic properly. If your PPTP client establishes the control channel
(RASMON beeps and the little telephone lights up) and sends GRE traffic
(the upper light in RASMON blinks) but gets no GRE traffic back (the lower
light in RASMON does not blink in response) the patch may not be
masquerading GRE traffic properly.
<P>Look in <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE> for log entries showing that VPN
traffic was seen. Turning on VPN debugging may help you to determine
whether or not the patch is at fault. Also run a sniffer on your internet
connection and look for outbound VPN traffic <EM>(see below)</EM>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Multiple clients: the older PPTP patch does NOT support masquerading
of multiple PPTP clients attempting to access the <EM>same</EM> PPTP
server. If you're trying to do this, you should take a look at your network
design and consider whether you should set up a PPTP router for your local
clients. The 2.0 patch incorporates Call-ID masquerading, which allows
multiple simultaneous sessions. <EM>Note:</EM> do not enable PPTP Call-ID
masquerade if you are masquerading a PPTP Server. At the current time this
will prevent the server's outbound traffic from being masqueraded.

</LI>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Troubleshooting</A>
</H2>

<P>Most problems can be localized by running a packet sniffer
(e.g. <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> with the <CODE>-v</CODE> option) on your VPN firewall.
If everything is working properly, you'll see the following traffic:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Client local network:
<P>IPsec: UDP (destination UDP port 500) and ESP (IP protocol 50) traffic from
your IPsec client local network IP to the remote IPsec host's Internet IP. If you
don't see this, your IPsec client is misconfigured.
<P>PPTP: TCP (destination TCP port 1723) and GRE (IP protocol 47) traffic from
your PPTP client local network IP to the PPTP server's Internet IP. If you
don't see this, your PPTP client is misconfigured.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>ISP side of client firewall: UDP and ESP or TCP and GRE traffic from
the client firewall Internet IP (remember - we're masquerading) to the
VPN server's Internet IP. If you don't see this, your masquerade is
misconfigured or the patch isn't working.
</LI>
<LI>ISP side of server firewall: UDP and ESP or TCP and GRE traffic from
the client Internet IP to the VPN server's Internet IP. If you don't see
this, the Internet is down <CODE>:)</CODE> or some intermediary is blocking ESP
or GRE traffic.
</LI>
<LI>Boundary network (DMZ) side of server firewall: UDP and ESP or TCP
and GRE traffic from the client internet IP to the server IP. If you don't
see this, check your firewall rules for forwarding UDP port 500 and IP
protocol 50 or TCP port 1723 and IP protocol 47, and the configuration of
<CODE>ipportfw</CODE> and <CODE>ipfwd</CODE> if you're masquerading the server.
</LI>
<LI>Boundary network side of server firewall: UDP (source port 500) and
ESP or TCP (source port 1723) and GRE traffic from the VPN server IP to
the client internet IP. If you don't see this, check the VPN server
configuration, including the packet filtering rules on the VPN server.
</LI>
<LI>ISP side of server firewall: UDP and ESP or TCP and GRE traffic from
the VPN server IP (or firewall IP if the server is masqueraded) to the
client internet IP. If you don't see this, check your firewall rules for
forwarding UDP port 500 and IP protocol 50 or TCP port 1723 and IP protocol
47.
</LI>
<LI>ISP side of client firewall: UDP and ESP or TCP and GRE traffic from
the VPN server IP to the client firewall internet IP. If you don't see
this, the Internet is acting up again.
</LI>
<LI>Client local network: UDP and ESP or TCP and GRE traffic from the VPN
server internet IP to the VPN client local network IP. If you see the UDP
traffic but not the ESP traffic, or the TCP traffic but not the GRE
traffic, the patch isn't working or wasn't properly installed.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>You may find it helpful to turn on VPN debugging and recompile your
kernel. Add the following to <CODE>/etc/syslog.conf</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
# debugging
*.=debug           /var/log/debug
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and watch <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE> and <CODE>/var/log/debug</CODE> for log
messages about the VPN traffic. Note that logging - especially verbose
logging - will cause a great deal of disk activity and will cause the log
files to grow very large very quickly. Don't turn on debugging unless you
need to, and turn it off when you're done.

</H2>

<P>Thanks to Charles Curley 
<A HREF="mailto:ccurley@trib.com">&lt;ccurley@trib.com&gt;</A> for the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you use PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) to access a Microsoft
Networking (SMB) environment and have your own Microsoft Networking
environment in your local private network (Samba or Windows), give your
local workgroup a name that does not show up in the remote environment. The
reason is that while your PPTP client is logged into the remote
environment, it will see the remote environment's domain name servers, and
will only see the remote computers in that workgroup.
<P>You should avoid the lazy option. Microsoft ships Windows set up for a
default workgroup name of WORKGROUP. Some people will be lazy and accept
that as their workgroup when they set up their computers. So there is a
good chance that the remote environment will have a workgroup called
WORKGROUP, administrators willing or not.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I think that this will apply regardless of the VPN in use, as name services
aren't dependent on the transport. If your client(s) can see the WINS servers
on the remote network then you may experience this, PPTP or no PPTP.

</H2>

<P>If you're having trouble with IPX traffic over your PPTP link, please see
sections 3.5 and 5.2 in this MS Knowledge Base article:
<A HREF="http://microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/dun13win95/ReleaseNotes.asp">http://microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/dun13win95/ReleaseNotes.asp</A><P>The same considerations probably apply to Win'98 as well.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 MS network password issues</A>
</H2>

<P>When you are using a VPN to access a MS network you should remember that
you will have to provide two different authentication tokens - one to
connect to the VPN server (the VPN password) and the other to access
resources on the remote network once the connection is established (the
network password).
<P>The VPN password - the username and password you enter into your VPN client
when initiating the call to the VPN server - is only used by the VPN server
to grant you permission to connect to the network via the VPN. It isn't
used for anything else once you're connected.
<P>The VPN password is <EM>not</EM> used to prove your identity to other
computers on the remote network. You must provide another username/password
pair - your network password - for that.
<P>There are two ways to supply a network password. Your network password may
be the same username/password pair you supplied when logging onto the local
network when you started your computer up. If it is different, you can
configure your VPN client to ask you for your network password for the
remote network once the VPN connection is established.
<P>If you are successfully connecting to the VPN server but you cannot access
any of the resources provided by the remote network, then you aren't
providing a valid network username/password pair for the remote network.
Verify that the username and password for your local network will also work
on the remote network, or set your VPN client to prompt you for a username
and password for use on the remote network and &quot;log on&quot; to the
remote network once the VPN connection is established.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 If your IPsec session always dies after a certain amount of time</A>
</H2>

<P>If you're having trouble with your IPsec tunnel regularly dying, particularly
if checking the system logs on the firewall shows that ISAKMP packets with
&quot;zero cookie&quot; values are being seen, here's what's happening:
<P>Earlier versions of the IPsec Masq patch did not change the timeout for
masq table entries for ISAKMP UDP packets. The masq table entries for the
ISAKMP UDP traffic would time out fairly quickly (relative to the data
channel) and be removed; if the remote IPsec host then decided to initiate
rekeying before the local IPsec host did, the inbound ISAKMP traffic for
the rekey couldn't be routed to the masqueraded host. The rekey traffic
would be discarded, the remote IPsec host would think the link had failed,
and the connection would eventually be terminated.
<P>The 2.0.x patch has been modified from its original version to increase the
timeout on ISAKMP UDP masq table entries. Get the current version of the patch,
available via the sites given in the Resources section, and repatch and
recompile your kernel.
<P>Also verify that your <CODE>IPsec Masq Table Lifetime</CODE> parameter is
configured to be the same as or slightly longer than your rekey interval.

<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2637.html">The PPTP RFC</A> specifies that there may only be one control channel
