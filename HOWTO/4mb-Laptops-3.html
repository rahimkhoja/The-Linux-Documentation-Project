<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Choices Made</A> </H2>

<P>This section describes the choices available, which options are practical,
which ones I decided on and why.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What to use to create the initial root partition?</A>
 </H2>

<P>The best tool for this is a mini-Linux. There's a wide selection of small
Linuces available on the net, but most of them won't boot in 4mb RAM. I found
two that will:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>SmallLinux  
<A HREF="http://smalllinux.netpedia.net/">http://smalllinux.netpedia.net/</A></B><DD><P>SmallLinux will boot in as little as 2mb RAM but its
root disk can't be taken out of the drive, which is a shame since otherwise
it has everything we need (i.e. fdisk, mkswap and mkfs.ext2). SmallLinux can
create the needed partitions but can't be used to copy the root partition.
<DT><B>muLinux  
<A HREF="http://sunsite.auc.dk/mulinux/">http://sunsite.auc.dk/mulinux/</A></B><DD><P>muLinux will boot in 4mb but only in a limited single-user
mode. In this mode fdisk and mkswap are available but mkfs.ext2 and the libraries
needed to run it are on the /usr partition which is not available in maintenance
mode. To use muLinux to do the whole pre-installation procedure the files needed
to create ext2 file-systems must be extracted from the usr disk image and copied
onto a floppy.
</DL>
<P>This gives the option of either using SmallLinux to create the partitions
and muLinux to copy the root partition or using muLinux to do the whole job.
Since I had two laptops I tried both.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 The Distribution</A>
 </H2>

<P>It didn't take much time to choose Slackware. Apart from the fact that
I like it but haven't used it much and want to learn more, I considered the
following points:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Slackware has possibly the most low-tech DIY install of all the major distributions.
It is also one of the most flexible, coming with a wide range of boot-disk
kernels to suit many different machines. This makes it well suited to the kind
of hacking about required in this scenario.</LI>
<LI>Slackware supports all the methods listed in 
<A HREF="#sec:whichmethod">Which Installation method to use?</A>.</LI>
<LI>Slackware is a distribution designed by one person. I'm sure Patrick Volkerding
won't object if I say this means its configuration tools are simpler and more
streamlined. In my opinion this makes the job of trimming the installation
to fit cramped conditions easier.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Version 7.0 was the latest version when I tried this so that's what I used.
<H3>But I don't like Slackware! </H3>

<P>You don't have to use it. I can't answer for all the distributions but
I know that Debian, Red Hat and SuSE offer a range of installation methods
and have an "expert" installation procedure  
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does Debian do any other kind?  </BLOCKQUOTE>

which can be used here. Most of the steps in this document would apply
to any of the distributions without change.
<P>If you haven't used the expert method with your preferred distribution
before, do a trial run on a simple desktop machine to get the feel of it and
to explore the options it offers.
<H2><A NAME="sec:whichmethod"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Which installation method to use?</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Floppy Install</B><DD><P>This means churning out 15 floppies - which only gives
you an absolute minimal install and requires a second stage to get the apps
you want on. It's also <EM>very</EM> slow on such low-spec machines. This is a last
resort if you can't make the others work.
<DT><B>Parallel-port Install</B><DD><P>Where the parallel port has an IDE device,
parallel cable or pocket ethernet adaptor  
<BLOCKQUOTE>A pocket lan adaptor installation onto these machines will be <EM>very</EM> slow.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

attached. This would be a good choice for the Aero, leaving the
PCMCIA slot free to run the floppy drive.
<DT><B>PCMCIA Install</B><DD><P>As above, this could be a CD-ROM or network install.
This would be the best method for the T1910 - on the Aero it's a bit more awkward.
<DT><B>ISA/PCI Ethernet Install</B><DD><P>Not an option for the laptops, obviously,
but included in case your target machine is a desktop PC.
</DL>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The tools I had to hand dictated a PCMCIA network install. I will point
out where steps differ for the other methods. Whichever method you choose,
you need to have a higher-spec machine available - even if only to create the
disks for a floppy install.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="sec:partitionlayout"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Partition Layout</A>
 </H2>

<H3>Basic Requirement </H3>

<P>This procedure requires at least two Linux Native partitions in addition
to a Swap partition. Since one of the ext2 partitions will be in use as temporary
root during the installation it will not be available as a target partition
and so should be small - though no smaller than 5mb. It makes sense to create
for this a partition that you will re-use as /home after installation is complete.
Another option would be to re-create it as a DOS partition to give you a dual
boot laptop.
<H3>How complex a layout? </H3>

<P>There isn't room to get too clever here. There is an argument for having
a single ext2 partition and using a swap file to avoid wasting space but I
would strongly urge creating a separate partition for /usr. If you have only
one partition and something goes wrong with it you may well be faced with a
complete re-installation. Separating /usr and having a small partition for
/ makes disaster recovery a more likely prospect. On both machines I created
4 partitions in total:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>A swap partition -- 16mb on the T1910, 20 on the Aero (I'm more likely
to upgrade the memory on the Aero).</LI>
<LI>/home (temporary root during installation) -- 10mb</LI>
<LI>/ -- 40mb on the T1910, 30mb on the Aero.</LI>
<LI>/usr -- All the remainder.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition, the Aero uses hda3 for a 2mb DOS partition containing configuration
utilities. See the Aero FAQs for details.
<H2><A NAME="sec:whichcomponents"></A> <A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Which components to install?</A>
 </H2>

<P>The full glibc libraries alone would nearly fill the hard disks so there's
no question of building a development machine. It looks as if a minimal X installation
can be squeezed in but I'm sure it would crawl and I don't want it anyway.
I decide to install the following (for a full listing see 
<A HREF="4mb-Laptops-7.html#sec:appendixA">Appendix A</A>):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The core Linux utilities</LI>
<LI>Assorted text apps from the ap1 file set:</LI>
<LI>Info/FAQ/HOWTO documentation</LI>
<LI>Basic networking utilities</LI>
<LI>The BSD games</LI>

<P>This selection matches the kind of machine described in
