<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc13.1">Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> When you are using a serial port, you may want to prevent others
from using it at the same time.  However there may be cases where you
do want others to use it, such as sending you an important message if
you are using a text-terminal.</P>
<P>There are various ways of preventing others (or other processes) from
using your serial port when you are using it (locking).  This should
all happen automatically but it's important to know about this if it
gives you trouble.  If a program is abnormally exited or the PC
is abruptly turned off (by pulling the plug, etc.) your serial port
might wind up locked.  Even if the lock remains, it's usually
automatically removed when you want to use the serial port again.
But in rare cases it isn't.  That's when you need to understand what
happened.</P>
<P>One way to implement locking is to design the kernel to handle it but
Linux thus far has shunned this solution (with an exception involving
the cua device which is now obsolete).  Two solutions used by Linux
is to:
<OL>
<LI> create lock-files</LI>
<LI> modify the permissions and/or owners of devices such as /dev/ttyS2</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="lockfiles_"></A> <A NAME="ss13.2">13.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc13.2">Lock-Files </A>
</H2>

<P> If you use the new device-filesystem (devfs) then see the next
section.  A lock-file is simply a file created to mean that a
particular device is in use.  They are kept in <CODE>/var/lock</CODE>.
Formerly they were in <CODE>/usr/spool/uucp</CODE>.  Linux lock-files are
usually named <CODE>LCK..</CODE><EM>name</EM>, where <EM>name</EM> may be a device
name, a process id number, a device's major and minor numbers, or a
UUCP site name.  Most processes (an exception is getty) create these
locks so that they can have exclusive access to devices.  For instance
if you dial out on your modem, some lockfiles will appear to tell
other processes that someone else is using the modem.  In older
versions (in the 1990s) there was usually only one lockfile per
process.  Lock files contain the PID of the process that has locked
the device.  Note that if a process insists on using a device that is
locked, it may ignore the lockfile and use the device anyway.  This is
useful in sending a message to a text-terminal, etc.</P>
<P>When a program wants to use a serial port but finds it locked with
lock-files it should check to see if the lock-file's PID is still in
use.  If it's not it means that the lock is stale and it's OK to go
ahead and use the port anyway (after removing the stale lock-files).
Unfortunately, there may be some programs that don't do this and give
up by telling you that a device is already in use when it really isn't.</P>
<P>If the lockfile only uses device names, the following problem could
arise:  If the same device has two different names then two different
processes could each use a different name for the same device.  This
results in lockfiles with different names that actually are the same
device.  Formerly each physical serial port was known by two different
device names: ttyS0 and cua0.  To solve this lockfile alias problem, 3
methods have been used.  It may be overkill since any one of these
methods would have fixed the problem.</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The lock checking software was made aware of ttyS vs. cua.</LI>
<LI> The device cua was deprecated</LI>
<LI> Additional locks were created which use unique device numbers
instead of names.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Using alternate names such as /dev/modem for /dev/ttyS2 may cause
problems if one program opens /dev/ttyS2 while another program opens
/dev/modem.  This problem was supposedly fixed around 2000, but is
still present in 2005.  For dumb terminals, lockfiles are not used
since this would not permit someone else to send a message to your
terminal using the write or talk program.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc13.3">Change Owners, Groups, and/or Permissions of Device Files</A>
</H2>

<P> In order to use a device, you (or the program you run if you have
"set user id") needs to have permission to read and write the device
"file" in the /dev directory.  So a logical way to prevent others from
using a device is to make yourself the temporary owner of the device
and set permissions so that no one else can use it.  A program may do
this for you.  A similar method can be used with the group of the
device file.</P>
<P>While lock files prevent other process from using the device, changing
device file owners/permissions restricts other users (or the group)
from using it.  One case is where the group is permitted to write to
the port, but not to read from it.  Writing to the port might just
mean a message sent to a text-terminal while reading means destructive
reading.  The original process that needs to read the data may find
data missing if another process has already read that data.  Thus a
read can do more harm that a write since a read causes loss of data
while a write only adds extra data.  That's a reason to allow writes
but not reads.  This is exactly the opposite of the case for ordinary
files where you allow others to read the file but not write (modify)
it.  Use of a port normally requires both read and write permissions.</P>
<P>A program that changes the device file attributes should undo these
changes when it exits.  But if the exit is abnormal, then a device
file may be left in such a condition that it gives the error
"permission denied" when one attempts to use it again.</P>
