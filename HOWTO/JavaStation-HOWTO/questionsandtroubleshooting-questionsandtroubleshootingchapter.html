</P
><P
>&#13;I (your HOWTO author) reported this problem to Sun in November 1999, 
at which time I was told a fix was not scheduled to be made, since I 
was using an <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

>.   Never mind 
that the client was a piece of hardware made by Sun itself.  Also never 
mind that indirect <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>XDMCP</SPAN
> queries is a standard itself 
which was broken by Sun.  A call back in late January 2000, and I learn that
the record of my previous call was non-existant, but a fix was now on
its way. The fix finally was made available in April 2000, five months
after first reporting the problem.  Considering revisions to this
patch during the broken <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>XDMCP</SPAN
> period dealt with
fixing system security issues, we were forced to run the older insecure
software for five months while waiting for a fix to a problem which
should have been patched immediately.
</P
><P
>&#13;The moral of the story: test your <SPAN

configuration against an upgraded server that is not in production mode.

it may be a new problem, so please report it.

>&#13;It is possible to boot a JavaStation-NC from flash, but requires
too much arcane knowledge at the moment to be recommended.  One problem
even if you do go this route is that flash can only be mounted read-only.
This gets to be a problem with many things, like X, which require the
writing of socket files.  A hybrid ramdisk/flash solution would be required.

>&#13;With the great embedded-root solution for the JavaStations, the question
popped up whether something similar can be done for stock x86 hardware.
While there are some x86 NICs that have boot roms on them, you'd also need
the piggyback program to put things together.  According to Eric Brower,
this currently is not possible as the piggyback program looks for a header
specific to the SPARC platform. (28-Apr-2000)

>9.21. Can I get an ok&#62; prompt like other Sun equipment?</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;A curious thing happens when you send a JavaStation a break: it resets,
not break down to the openboot prom prompt like other Sun equipment.
This can be changed on a Krups by setting jumper J1300, pins 7-8. 
Doing this gets a OBP ok prompt with a Ctrl-Alt-Break on a PS/2 keyboard
or break through a serial terminal.
</P
><P
>&#13;You can also get the ok prompt on the Dover unit, but it requires a hardware
fix.  To do so on this unit, you must solder a 220K ohm resistor in 
location R362 (near the FDD connector).

>9.22. My keyboard isn't recognized.  What can I do?</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;While it's unlikely, it could be possible that you have a javastation
set in the wrong input device mode.  To rectify this, you need to enable
the openboot prom prompt as described elsewhere in this HOWTO, and then
set the 'input-device' directive accordingly.  Or, as one contributor
did before the OBP setting was discovered, load up NetBSD on your 
JavaStation and run the eeprom command there.  Convoluted, but it 
works too.

></H2
><P
>&#13;Truecolor on Krups with Linux is a bit of a controversy.  Some believe
it is possible, while others do not.  
</P
><P
>&#13;First, the Krups is listed as having the IGS C1682 framebuffer, while 
the Espresso has the IGS C2000 chip.
</P
><P
>&#13;According to an earlier report by one kernel hacker, the reason for Krups 
not supporting TrueColor is due to lack of kernel support for the Cyber2000
chip.  Perhaps the C2000 for the Espresso is the 'Cyber2000'?  And perhaps
the C2000 is near equal to the C1682.  Notes on the ZLS website seem
to point to this.
</P
><P
>&#13;Recent 2.4.x series kernels have an entry labeled 'Cyber2000'.  Perhaps this
works?  One contributor tried and failed.
</P
><P
>&#13;Ok, there is a userland utility called 'fbset' to change the modes of
a framebuffer.  Does that work?  One contributor said no.
</P
><P
>&#13;In the sparclinux archives is a report of a user using the 24-bit TCX
framebuffer and having success.  But TCX chip was in Mr. Coffee, not
Krups, and TCX onboard Mr. Coffee had 8-bit max, not 24.
</P
><P
>&#13;So what is the real scoop with 24-bit color on the Krups?  Until others
try things and speak up, we don't know.

You must use x86 procedures to make it work properly.  You did read the
warning in the Dover introduction section, didn't you?

>&#13;I am receiving multiple reports of kernel load failures with the Dover unit.
As more information comes in, this HOWTO will present it.
