&#8212; you can still get at the administration page from the wireless
side.  This bug is still present in the 2.02 firmware, October 2004. It
means that if you leave your password at default, any script kiddie can
break in, steal your WEP, and scramble your configuration. The Linksys
people get the moron medal with oak-leaf cluster for this screwup.</P

would be a good idea to check.)</P

A good minimum set is 22 (ssh), and 80 (http).  If you want to receive mail
add 25 (smtp).  If you need to serve DNS queries, add 53. To serve identd
so remote MTAs can verify your identity, enable 113.</P

Make sure <SPAN

<SPAN

the default); otherwise the Linksys won't pass packets for your Unix box at
all. Newer versions of the firmware don't have this misfeature.</P

Inspection.</EM
> If you want to run a server and are running
1.42 or earlier firmware, you also need to make sure stateful packet
inspection is off &#8212; this feature restricts incoming packets to those
associated with an outbound connection and is intended for heightened
security on client-only systems.  On the
<SPAN

relax &#8212; the feature isn't present in all versions of the firmware,
and in fact was removed in 1.43 for stability reasons.</P
