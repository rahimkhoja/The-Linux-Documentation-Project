<P>Any other associated stuff that didn't fit in anywhere else gets
dumped here. It may not be relevant, and it may not be of general
interest but it is here anyway.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Transmit FIFO Buffers and Underrun Errors</A>
</H2>

<P>Donald wrote a nice description of what the Tx FIFO does
and when an error occurs. Here it is:
<P>Where the hardware supports it, my drivers have dynamic Tx FIFO
tuning code.  A typical Ethernet chip has a Tx FIFO that holds data 
from the bus before it is transmitted on the wire.  The way this 
FIFO is controlled is important for performance.
<P>Ideally you would like to start transmitting as soon as the first Tx
packet data arrives at the chip.  The "Tx FIFO threshold" is a 
parameter that specifies "start transmitting when N bytes have 
arrived at the NIC chip".  This parameter is initially set for a 
typical configuration.  But if a video card or SCSI controller is 
doing long PCI bursts, the NIC chip will run out of buffered data 
before it can get access to the bus again.  This causes a FIFO 
underrun.
<P>The driver responds to the FIFO underrun by changing the Tx FIFO
threshold to a higher value.  If this happens enough eventually the
chip will end up in store-and-forward mode, where it doesn't start
transmitting until the whole packet has been transferred.
<P>Some designs, such as the Adaptec Starfire, go one step further and
provide an indication that the FIFO almost ran out of data.  This 
allows the driver to tune the setting without risking a Tx error.
<P>It should be rare to see more than one or two Tx FIFO underruns.  
Either the chip has very coarse Tx threshold settings, or the 
driver increases the setting in large chunks to keep the PCI 
bursts on natural boundaries.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="lilo"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Passing Ethernet Arguments to the Kernel</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Here are two generic kernel commands that can be passed to
the kernel at boot time (<CODE>ether</CODE> and <CODE>reserve</CODE>). 
This can be done with LILO, loadlin,
or any other booting utility that accepts optional arguments.
<P>For example, if the command was `blah' and it expected 3 arguments
(say 123, 456, and 789) then, with LILO, you would use:
<P><CODE>LILO: linux blah=123,456,789</CODE>
<P>These boot time arguments can be made permanent so that you
don't have to re-enter them every time. Usually this is
as simple as adding <CODE>append="blah=123,456,789"</CODE>
to the top of your <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file. See the LILO
documentation for more details.
<P>For more information on (and a complete list of) boot time
arguments, please see the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html">BootPrompt-HOWTO</A><P>
<H3><A NAME="ether"></A> The <CODE>ether</CODE> command</H3>

<P>
<P>The <CODE>ether=</CODE> argument is used in conjunction with
drivers that are directly built into the kernel. The
<CODE>ether=</CODE> argument will have <EM>absolutely no effect</EM>
on a modular driver.  In its most generic form, it 
looks something like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ether=IRQ,BASE_ADDR,PARAM_1,PARAM_2,NAME
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All arguments are optional.  The first non-numeric argument
is taken as the NAME.
<P><B>IRQ:</B>
Obvious.  An IRQ value of `0' (usually the default) means to autoIRQ.
It's a historical accident that the IRQ setting is first rather than
the base_addr -- this will be fixed whenever something else changes.
<P><B>BASE_ADDR:</B>
Also obvious.  A value of `0' (usually the default) means to
probe a card-type-specific address list for an ethercard.
<P><B>PARAM_1:</B>
It was orginally used as an override value for the memory start
for a shared-memory ethercard, like the WD80*3.
Some drivers use the low four bits of this value to set the debug
message level.  0 -- default, 1-7 -- level 1..7, (7 is maximum
verbosity)  8 -- level 0 (no messages). Also, the LANCE driver
uses the low four bits of this value to select the DMA channel.
Otherwise it uses auto-DMA.
<P><B>PARAM_2:</B>
The 3c503 driver uses this to select between the internal and external
transceivers.  0 -- default/internal, 1 -- AUI external.
The Cabletron E21XX card also uses the low 4 bits of PARAM_2 to 
select the output media. Otherwise it detects automatically.
<P><B>NAME:</B>
Selects the network device the values refer to.  The standard kernel
uses the names `eth0', `eth1', `eth2' and `eth3' for bus-attached
ethercards, and `atp0' for the parallel port `pocket' ethernet
adaptor. The arcnet driver uses `arc0' as its name.
The default setting is for a single ethercard to be probed for as
`eth0'.  Multiple cards can only be enabled by explicitly setting up
their base address using these LILO parameters.
The 1.0 kernel has LANCE-based ethercards as a special case.  LILO
arguments are ignored, and LANCE cards are always assigned
`eth&lt;n&gt;' names starting at `eth0'.  Additional non-LANCE ethercards
must be explicitly assigned to `eth&lt;n+1&gt;', and the usual `eth0'
probe disabled with something like  `ether=0,-1,eth0'.
( Yes, this is bug. )
<P>
<H3><A NAME="reserve"></A> The <CODE>reserve</CODE> command</H3>

<P>
<P>This next lilo command is used just like `ether=' above, ie. it is
appended to the name of the boot select specified in lilo.conf
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
reserve=IO-base,extent{,IO-base,extent...}
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In some machines it may be necessary to prevent device drivers from
checking for devices (auto-probing) in a specific region. This may be
because of poorly designed hardware that causes the boot to <EM>freeze</EM>
(such as some ethercards), hardware that is mistakenly identified,
hardware whose state is changed by an earlier probe, or merely
hardware you don't want the kernel to initialize.
<P>The <CODE>reserve</CODE> boot-time argument addresses this problem by specifying
an I/O port region that shouldn't be probed. That region is reserved
in the kernel's port registration table as if a device has already
been found in that region. Note that this mechanism shouldn't be
necessary on most machines. Only when there is a problem or special
case would it be necessary to use this.
<P>The I/O ports in the specified region are protected against
device probes. This was put in to be used when some driver was
hanging on a NE2000, or misidentifying some other device
as its own.  A correct device driver shouldn't probe a reserved
region, unless another boot argument explicitly specifies that
it do so.  This implies that <CODE>reserve</CODE> will most often be used
with some other boot argument. Hence if you specify a <CODE>reserve</CODE>
region to protect a specific device, you must generally specify
an explicit probe for that device. Most drivers ignore the port
registration table if they are given an explicit address.
<P>For example, the boot line
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
LILO: linux  reserve=0x300,32  ether=0,0x300,eth0
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>keeps all device drivers except the ethercard drivers from
probing 0x300-0x31f.
<P>As usual with boot-time specifiers there is an 11 parameter limit,
thus you can only specify 5 reserved regions per <CODE>reserve</CODE> keyword.
Multiple <CODE>reserve</CODE> specifiers will work if you have an unusually
complicated request.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="modules"></A> <A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Using the Ethernet Drivers as Modules</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Most of the linux distributions now ship kernels that have
very few drivers built-in.  The drivers are instead supplied as
a bunch of independent dynamically loadable modules.  These
modular drivers are typically loaded by the administrator
with the <CODE>modprobe(8)</CODE> command, or in some cases they are
automatically loaded by the kernel through `kerneld' (in
2.0) or `kmod' (in 2.1) which then calls <CODE>modprobe</CODE>.
<P>Your particular distribution may offer nice graphical
configuration tools for setting up ethernet modules. If possible
you should try and use them first. The description that follows
here gives information on what underlies any fancy configuration
program, and what these programs change.
<P>The information that controls what modules are to be used and
what options are supplied to each module is usually stored in
the file <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>.  The two main options of
interest (for ethernet cards) that will be used in this file
are <CODE>alias</CODE> and <CODE>options</CODE>.  The <CODE>modprobe</CODE> command
consults this file for module information.
<P>The actual modules themselves are typically stored in a directory
named <CODE>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/net</CODE> where the
<CODE>uname -r</CODE> command gives the kernel version (e.g. 2.0.34).
You can look in there to see which module matches your card.
<P>The first thing you need in your <CODE>modules.conf</CODE> file is
something to tell <CODE>modprobe</CODE> what driver to use for the
<CODE>eth0</CODE> (and <CODE>eth1</CODE> and...) network interface.  You
use the <CODE>alias</CODE> command for this.  For example, if you
have an ISA SMC EtherEZ card which uses the <CODE>smc-ultra.o</CODE>
driver module, you need to <CODE>alias</CODE> this driver to <CODE>eth0</CODE>
by adding the line:
<P>
<PRE>
        alias eth0 smc-ultra
</PRE>
<P>Important Note:  The alias above is only used by the module 
utilities to translate a generic device name (e.g.<CODE>eth0</CODE>)
into a hardware specific driver module name.  When the driver
loads, it never even sees this alias; instead it will simply 
choose the first free <CODE>ethN</CODE> (N=0,1,2,...)
device name available. Thus, if more than one ethernet module is
being loaded, the <CODE>ethN</CODE> assigned to the driver by the kernel
may or may not be the same as the one given on the alias line, 
depending on the order in which the modules have been loaded.
If you need to ensure that a particular card is given a particular
IP address, then read the station address and assign your
IP address based upon that.  If you are writing your own shell 
scripts for this, you can just parse the ifconfig output; if
using C, then you would
use <CODE>ioctl(ethfd, SIOCGIFHWADDR, &amp;ifreq)</CODE>.
<P>The other thing you may need is an <CODE>options</CODE> line indicating
what options are to be used with a particular module (or module
alias). Continuing with the above example, if you only used the
single <CODE>alias</CODE> line with no <CODE>options</CODE> line, the kernel would
warn you (see <CODE>dmesg</CODE>) that autoprobing for ISA cards is not
a good idea.  To get rid of this warning, you would add another
line telling the module what I/O base the card is configured to,
in this case say the hexidecimal address <CODE>0x280</CODE> for example.
<P>
<PRE>
        options smc-ultra io=0x280
</PRE>
<P>Most ISA modules accept parameters like <CODE>io=0x340</CODE> and
<CODE>irq=12</CODE> on the <CODE>insmod</CODE> command line. It is <EM>REQUIRED</EM>
or at least <EM>STRONGLY ADVISED</EM> that you supply these parameters
to avoid probing for the card. Unlike PCI and EISA devices,
there is no real safe way to do auto-probing for most ISA devices,
and so it should be avoided when using drivers as modules.
<P>A list of all the options that each module accepts can be
found in the file:
<P><CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt</CODE>
<P>It is recommended that you read that to find out what options
you can use for your particular card.
Note that some modules support comma separated value lists for modules
that have the capability to handle multiple devices from a single
module, such as all the 8390 based drivers, and the PLIP driver.
For exmple:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
        options 3c503 io=0x280,0x300,0x330,0x350 xcvr=0,1,0,1
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The above would have the one module controlling four
3c503 cards, with card 2 and 4 using external
transcievers. Don't put spaces around the `=' or commas.
<P>Also note that a <EM>busy</EM> module can't be removed. That means
that you will have to <CODE>ifconfig eth0 down</CODE>  (shut down the
ethernet card) before you can remove the module(s).
<P>The command <CODE>lsmod</CODE> will show you what modules are
loaded, whether they are in use, and <CODE>rmmod</CODE> will remove them.
<P>

</H2>

<P>
<P>Much of this info came from saved postings from the comp.os.linux
groups, which shows that it is a valuable resource of information.
Other useful information came from a bunch of small files by Donald
himself. Of course, if you are setting up an Ethernet card,
then you will want to read the NET-2 Howto so that you can actually
configure the software you will use.  Also, if you fancy yourself as
a bit of a hacker, you can always scrounge some additional info
from the driver source files as well. There is usually a paragraph
or two in there describing any important points before any actual
code starts..
<P>For those looking for information that is not specific in any way
to Linux (i.e. what is 10BaseT, what is AUI, what does a hub do, etc.)
I strongly recommend making use of the newsgroup <EM>comp.dcom.lans.ethernet</EM>
and/or <EM>comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.networking</EM>.  Newsgroup archives
such as those at <CODE>dejanews.com</CODE> can also be an invaluable source
of information.
You can grab the newsgroup FAQ from RTFM (which holds all the newsgroup
FAQs) at the following URL:

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Closing</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In the early days of linux, some ten(!) years ago, there
were not a lot of drivers and not a lot of users.  I had
the time to follow individual driver developments, read
about common problems in newsgroups, and answer posted
and e-mailed questions.   Things are a lot different now.
There are a huge number of drivers, and a huge number of
users too, and there is no way I can keep up with each
new development!   This is where I need your help. 
If you have found a new driver that isn't mentioned here,
or any glaring typos, or outdated info in this
document, please send an e-mail. It is big, and it
is easy to overlook stuff. If you have e-mailed about a change,
and it hasn't been included in the next version, please don't
hesitate to send it again, as it might have got lost amongst
the usual sea of SPAM and junk mail I get.
<P>Thanks!
