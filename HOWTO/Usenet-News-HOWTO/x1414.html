NAME="AEN1520">14.2.2. The Usenix paper on INN</H3
><P
>This paper talks about the things that C News didn't address,
and takes Usenet news processing into the world of pure Internet
connectivity. Its author is Rich Salz, the author of INN, and the paper
is titled ``InterNetNews: Usenet Transport for Internet Sites.'' This
can be picked up from
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/nntp/inn/inn.usenix.ps.Z</TT

uncompressed.
Be warned: this PostScript file is probably missing some mandatory
first-line tag like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%!PS-Adobe-1.0</TT
> and some
PostScript processors can have problems with it. For instance, on our
Linux boxes, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ghostview</TT
> can display it, but
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kghostview</TT
> can't, which is very strange.</P
><P
>This paper analyses the world of Usenet servers with C News and
NNTPd, in the presence of multiple parallel feeds, and proceeds to build
a case for a powerful NNTP-optimised software architecture which will
handle multiple parallel incoming NNTP feeds efficiently. What later INN
users appear to miss sometimes when comparing C-News+NNTPd with INN, is
that INN's strengths are <EM
>only</EM
> in situations which
its author had specifically targeted, <EM
>i.e.</EM
> multiple
parallel incoming NNTP feeds. There is no clear superiority of one
system over the other in any other situation.</P

><P
>O'Reilly and Associates had an excellent book that can form the
foundations for understanding C-News and Usenet news in general, titled
``Managing UUCP and Usenet,'' dated 1992. This was considered a bit
dated because it did not cover INN or the Internet protocols.</P
><P
>They have subsequently published a more recent book, titled
``Managing Usenet,'' written by Henry Spencer, the co-author of C-News,
and David Lawrence, one of the most respected Usenet veterans and
administrators today. The book was published in 1998 and includes both
C-News and INN.</P
><P
>We have a distinct preference for books published by O'Reilly; we
usually find them the best books on their subjects. We make no attempts
to hide this bias. We recommend both books. In fact, we believe that
there is very little of value in this HOWTO for someone who studies one
of these books and then peruses information on the Internet.</P
