><P
>The Usenet is a huge worldwide collection of discussion
groups. Each discussion group has a name, <EM
>e.g.</EM
>
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>comp.os.linux.announce</TT
>, and a collection of messages.
These messages, usually called <EM
>articles</EM
>, are posted
by readers like you and me who have access to Usenet servers, and are
then stored on the Usenet servers.</P
><P
>This ability to both read and write into a Usenet newsgroup makes
the Usenet very different from the bulk of what people today call ``the
Internet.'' The Internet has become a colloquial term to refer to the
World Wide Web, and the Web is (largely) read-only. There are online
discussion groups with Web interfaces, and there are mailing lists, but
Usenet is probably more convenient than either of these for most large
discussion communities. This is because the articles get replicated to
your local Usenet server, thus allowing you to read and post articles
without accessing the global Internet, something which is of great value
for those with slow Internet links. Usenet articles also conserve
bandwidth because they do not come and sit in each member's mailbox, unlike 
email
based mailing lists. This way, twenty members of a mailing list in one
office will have twenty copies of each message copied to their
mailboxes. However, with a Usenet discussion group and a local Usenet
server, there's just one copy of each article, and it does not fill up
anyone's mailbox.</P
><P
>Another nice feature of having your own local Usenet server is
that articles stay on the server even after you've read them. You can't
accidentally delete a Usenet articles the way you can delete a message
from your mailbox. This way, a Usenet server is an
<EM
>excellent</EM
> way to archive articles of a group
discussion on a local server without placing the onus of archiving on
any group member. This makes local Usenet servers very valuable as
archives of internal discussion messages within corporate Intranets,
provided the article expiry configuration of the Usenet server software
has been set up for sufficiently long expiry periods.</P

NAME="AEN38">1.2. How it works, loosely speaking</H2
><P
> Usenet news works by the reader first firing up a Usenet news
program, which in today's GUI world will highly likely be something like
Netscape Messenger or Microsoft's Outlook Express. There are a lot of
proven, well-designed character-based Usenet news readers, but a proper
review of the user agent software is outside the scope of this HOWTO, so
we will just assume that you are using whatever software you like. The
reader then selects a Usenet newsgroup from the hundreds or thousands of
newsgroups which are hosted by her local server, and accesses all unread
articles. These articles are displayed to her. She can then decide to
respond to some of them.</P
><P
>When the reader writes an article, either in response to an
existing one or as a start of a brand-new thread of discussion, her
software <EM
>posts</EM
> this article to the Usenet server.
The article contains a list of newsgroups into which it is to be posted.
Once it is accepted by the server, it becomes available for other users
to read and respond to. The article is automatically
<EM
>expired</EM
> or deleted by the server from its internal
archives based on expiry policies set in its software; the author of the
article usually can do little or nothing to control the expiry of her
articles.</P
><P
>A Usenet server rarely works on its own. It forms a part of
a collection of servers, which automatically exchange articles with
each other. The flow of articles from one server to another is called a
<EM
>newsfeed</EM
>. In a simplistic case, one can imagine a
worldwide network of servers, all configured to replicate articles with
each other, busily passing along copies across the network as soon as one
of them receives a new articles posted by a human reader. This replication
is done by powerful and fault-tolerant processes, and gives the Usenet
network its power. Your local Usenet server literally has a copy of all
current articles in all relevant newsgroups.</P

It was last updated in 1997, but trends haven't changed much since
then, though absolute volume figures have.</P
><P
>If you want your Usenet server to be a repository for all articles
in all newsgroups, you will probably not be reading this HOWTO, or even
if you do, you will rapidly realise that anyone who needs to read this
HOWTO may not be ready to set up such a server. This is because the
volumes of articles on the Usenet have reached a point where very
specialised networks, very high end servers, and large disk arrays
are required for handling such Usenet volumes. Those setups are called
``carrier-class'' Usenet servers, and will be discussed a bit later on in
this HOWTO. Administering such an array of hardware may not be the job
of the new Usenet administrator, for which this HOWTO (and most Linux
HOWTO's) are written.</P
><P
>Nevertheless, it may be interesting to understand what volumes we
are talking about. Usenet news article volumes have been doubling every
fourteen months or so, going by what we hear in comments from
carrier class Usenet administrators. In the beginning of 1997, this
volume was 1.2 GBytes of articles a day. Thus, the volumes should have
roughly done five doublings, or grown 32 times, by the time we reach
mid-2002, at the time of this writing. This gives us a volume of 38.4
GBytes per day. Assume that this transfer happens using uncompressed
NNTP (the norm), and add 50% extra for the overheads of NNTP, TCP,
and IP. This gives you a raw data transfer volume of 57.6 GBytes/day or
about 460 Gbits/day. If you have to transfer such volumes of data in 24
hours (86400 seconds), you'll need raw bandwidth of about 5.3 Mbits per
second just to <EM
>receive all these articles</EM
>. You'll
need more bandwidth to send out feeds to other neighbouring Usenet
servers, and then you'll need bandwidth to allow your readers to access
your servers and read and post articles in retail quantities. Clearly,
these volume figures are outside the network bandwidths of most
corporate organisations or educational institutions, and therefore only
those who are in the business of offering Usenet news can afford
it.</P
><P
>At the other end of the scale, it is perfectly feasible for a
small office to subscribe to a well-trimmed subset of Usenet newsgroups,
and exclude most of the high-volume newsgroups.  Starcom Software, where
the authors of this HOWTO work, has worked with a fairly large subset of
600 newsgroups, which is still a tiny fraction of the 15,000+ newsgroups
that the carrier class services offer. Your office or college may not
even need 600 groups. And our company had excluded specific high-volume
but low-usefulness newsgroups like the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>talk</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>comp.binaries</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>alt</TT
>
hierarchies. With the pruned subset, the total volume of articles per
day may amount to barely a hundred MBytes a day or so, and can be easily
handled by most small offices and educational institutions. And in such
situations, a single Intel Linux server can deliver excellent performance
as a Usenet server.</P
><P
>Then there's the <EM
>internal</EM
> Usenet service. By
internal here, we mean a private set of Usenet newsgroups, not a private
computer network. Every company or university which runs a Usenet news
service creates its own hierarchy of internal newsgroups, whose articles
never leave the campus or office, and which therefore do not consume
Internet bandwidth. These newsgroups are often the ones most hotly
accessed, and will carry more <EM
>internally generated</EM
>
traffic than all the ``public'' newsgroups you may subscribe to, within your
organisation.  After all, how often does a guy have something to say
which is relevant to the world at large, unless he's discussing a globally
relevant topic like ``Unix rules!''? If such internal newsgroups are the
focus of your Usenet servers, then you may find that fairly modest
hardware and Internet bandwidth will suffice, depending on the size of
your organisation.</P
><P
>The new Usenet server administrator has to undertake a sizing
exercise to ensure that he does not bite off more than he, or his
network resources, can chew. We hope we have provided sufficient
information for him to get started with the right questions.</P
