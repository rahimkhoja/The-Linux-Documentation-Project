>C-News software can be obtained from
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/transport/cnews/cnews.tar.Z</TT
>
and will need to be uncompressed using the BSD
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>uncompress</TT
> utility or a compatible program. The
tarball is about 650 KBytes in size. It has its own highly intelligent
configuration and installation processes, which are very well
documented. The version that is available is Cleanup Release revision G,
on which our own version is based.</P
><P
>NNTPd (the NNTP Reference Implementation) is available from
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/nntp/nntp.1.5.12.1.tar.Z</TT
>.
It has no automatic scripts and processes to configure itself. After
fetching the sources, you will have to follow a set of directions given
in the documentation and configure some C header files. These
configuration settings must be done keeping in mind what you have
specified when you build the C-News sources, because NNTPd and C-News
must work together. Therefore, some key file formats, directory paths,
<EM
>etc.</EM
>, will have to be specified identically in both
software systems.</P
><P
>The third software system we use is Nestor. This too is to be
found in the same place where the NNTPd software is kept, at
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/nntp/nestor.tar.Z</TT
>.
This software compiles to one binary program, which must be run
periodically to process the logs of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
>, the NNTP
server which is part of NNTPd, and report usage statistics to the
administrator. We have integrated Nestor into our source base.</P
><P
>The fourth piece of the system, without which no Usenet server
administrator dares venture out into the wild world of public Internet
newsfeeds, is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pgpverify</TT
>.</P
><P
>We have been working with C-News and NNTPd for many years now, and
have fixed a few bugs in both packages. We have also integrated the four
software systems listed above, and added a few features here and there to
make things work more smoothly. We offer our entire source base to
anyone for free download from
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>http://www.starcomsoftware.com/proj/usenet/src/news.tar.gz</TT
>.
There are no licensing restrictions on our sources; they are as freely
redistributable as the original components we started with.</P

to find a directory tree with the following subdirectories and files:</P

><P
>Once you get the sources, you will need some key configuration
files to seed your C-News system. These configuration files are
actually database tables, and are changing frequently, whenever
newsgroups are created, modified or deleted. These files specify
the list of active newsgroups in the ``public'' Usenet. You can,
and should, add your organisation's internal newsgroups to this
list when you set up your own server, but you will need to know
the list of public standard newsgroups to begin with. This list
can be obtained from the same FTP server by downloading the files
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>active.gz</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newsgroups.gz</TT
> from
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/config/</TT

can create your own <TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newsgroups</TT
> files by retaining a subset of the entries
in these two files. Both these are ASCII text files.</P

>Getting the sources from our server will not obviate the need to
get the latest versions of these files from
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ftp.uu.net</TT

copy of these files on our server, and we will add no value to the
original by just mirroring them.</P

NAME="AEN358">4.2. Compiling and installing</H2

>    For installing, first make sure you have an entry for a user called 
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>news</TT
> in your <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/password</TT
> file. This
    is setting the news-database owner to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>news</TT
>. Now download
    the source from us and untar it in the home directory of news. This creates
    two main directories <EM
>viz.</EM
> <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>c-news</TT
>
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntp</TT
>. 
    To install and compile, run the script <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>build.sh</TT
> as root
    in the directory that contains the script. It is important that the script 
    run as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root</TT
> as it sets ownerships, installs and 
    compiles the source as user <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>news</TT
>. This
    is a one-step process that puts in place both the C-News and the
    NNTP software, setting correct permissions and paths.
    Following
    is a brief description of what build.sh does:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P

    Checks for the <TT

    it is not <TT

    Again, exits if you are not running as
    <TT

>make.out.r</TT

    Compilation erros are written to a file called <TT

    Performs the above operation in the <TT

    executables for
    the working of the Usenet News system. Tries to create them if non-existent
    and exits if it results in failure.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> 
    Changes the ownership of these directories to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>news.news</TT

    This is important since the entire Usenet News System runs as user <TT

    will not function properly as any other user. </P

    of the GNU Project and is the default UUCP on Linux
    systems.</P
><P
>A full treatment of UUCP configuration is beyond the scope of
    this document. However, the basic steps will be as follows. First,
    you will have to define a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"system"</SPAN
> in your Usenet server for the
    NDN (next door neighbour) host. This definition will include various
    parameters, including the manner in which your server will call the
    remote server, the protocol it will use, <EM
>etc.</EM
>
    Then an identical process will have to be followed on the NDN
    server's UUCP configuration, for your server, so that
    <EM
>that</EM
> server can recognize
    <EM
>your</EM
> Usenet server.</P

>Finally, you will need to set up appropriate
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    to run <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>uucico</TT

    a script called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>uusched</TT

    your requirements; this script calls <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>uucico</TT

    news batches. Smaller sites can run <TT

    once or twice a day.</P
><P
>Later versions of this document will include the
    <TT

    UUCP over TCP/IP, and we run the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    connection through an SSH tunnel, to prevent transmission of
    UUCP passwords in plain text over the Internet, and our SSH tunnel
    is established using public-key cryptography, without passwords

>For NNTP feeds, you will have to decide whether your server
    will be the connection initiator or connection recipient. If you are
    the connection initiator, you can send outgoing NNTP feeds more
    easily. If you are the connection recipient, then outgoing feeds
    will have to be pulled out of your server using the NNTP
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NEWNEWS</TT
> command, which will place heavy loads on
    your server. This is not recommended.</P
><P
>Connecting to your NDN server for pushing out outgoing feeds
    will require the use of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpsend.sh</TT
> script,
    which is part of the NNTPd source tree. This script will perform
    some housekeeping, and internally call the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpxmit</TT
> binary to actually send the queued set
    of articles out. You may have to provide authentication information
    like usernames and passwords to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpxmit</TT

    it to connect to your NDN server, in case that server insists on
    checking the identity of incoming connections. (You can't be too
    careful in today's world.) <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpsend.sh</TT

    up after an <TT

    will requeue any unsent articles for the next session. Thus, even if
    there is a network problem, typically nothing is lost and all
    pending articles are transmitted next time.</P
><P
>Thus, pushing feeds out <EM
>via</EM

    setting up <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpsend.sh</TT

    invoking it periodically from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    process which sets up the Internet connection should be extended or
    modified to fire <TT

    link is established. For instance, if you are using the Linux
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pppd</TT

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
