<LI><P>There is no need to add /dev/winswap to your /etc/fstab file.  In fact, it is 
probably wise not to do so (except possibly as a comment).

If your Linux session crashes or otherwise exits without running 
/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt, you will need to reboot and exit Linux before swapping 
in Windows will work.  It is also possible to FORMAT X: and re-create the 
Windows swap file.  The only way around this would be to put the equivalent of 
the /.../halt commands in the DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT file. I have tried to write 
some programs to do this, but that turned out to be a hell lot of trouble !
First and foremost, simply restoring the total special sectors doesn't
please DOS. Along with that, it seems you need to modify some internal data
structures so that DOS starts recognizing your drive, otherwise DOS comes
out with the error message:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Invalid media type reading drive X:
Abort, Retry or Fail ?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Since I am not aware of many details of DOS's or Windows's handling of
disk drives, I think at this point, you may consult some DOS expert.
Of course, if you are not concerned about the booting time, then you can
simply add the command to perform an unconditional FORMAT of X: and then
restore the TSS's. May be there are some other solutions. If you are aware
of one, please e-mail me today !

One way to restore your Windows swap partition is to start Linux, disable 
swapping as described above, and then use the following command : 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
# swapoff -a 
# zcat /etc/winswap.gz > /dev/winswap 
# reboot 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P><B>Why to delete the RECYCLED folder ?</B>
According to the procedure mentioned above, you must delete the <CODE>RECYCLED</CODE>
folder. This is necessary because we will be saving and restoring only the
sectors unto the root directory, but no further sectors. Also, we want the
drive X: to be restored to a "clean" state with no errors. If we don't
delete the <CODE>RECYCLED</CODE> folder, then the root directory entry is
restored, but the "." and ".." entries for this folder are not restored
and ScanDisk finds errors on the disk. To prevent this from happening, we
will delete the <CODE>RECYCLED</CODE> folder and hence only the entry for win386.swp file will be restored.

If DOS' FDISK reports the partition as a "logical DOS drive", it has a number 
of 5 (as in /dev/hda5) or higher.  It is *NOT* the partition labelled 
"extended" which has a number of 4 or less!!  If your Linux fdisk does not 
display logical partitions, you have a broken Linux fdisk (Slackware 2.2 
included a broken fdisk, for example.)  You can try "cfdisk" if your 
distribution has it, or you will have to get a working fdisk.

<P>When you turn off swapping, Linux has to manage everything in the main
memory itself. If your system memory is low, say something like 16MB, then
some large applications that run during initialization may not be able to
run properly. As an example, you may get the following message during
initialization:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Finding module dependencies Out of memory
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I don't think this will cause any problems later until you reenable
swapping. But it's always better to take some precautions. As you will be
seeing in the next section, Linux can also be configured to use a swap
file instead of a swap partition. So if you feel that Linux will not run
properly with your normal system memory, create a swap file that Linux
will use temporarily until swapping is restored. This swap file should
preferably in the root directory. Figure out the minimum size of swap space
required. It will probably equal to your system memory. Create a swap file 
of that size by giving the following commands (assuming 16MB swap space):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=16384
# mkswap /swap 16384
# sync
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now place the command <CODE>swapon /swap</CODE> just after the original 
<CODE>swapon -a</CODE> command in the rc.sysinit file. Thus, now your system
has been configured to use swap file and hopefully there will be no Out
of memory errors. After having a workable swap partition (i.e after
following through this HOWTO completely), you can remove the <CODE>swapon /swap</CODE> line that you added to your rc.sysinit file.

Please do not mail me unless you have checked and re-checked that you copied 
your scripts correctly.  More than half of the problems reported with this 
Mini-HOWTO have been due to typos when copying the scripts.  (Use cut-and-
paste if you can!). Even a spacing error can cause an error. For example, if 
at the startup you get the messages 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
Verifying swap space...Linux signature found 
swapon: /dev/winswap invalid argument 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then, surely there has been a typing mistake in your scripts. Please check 
your scripts. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><P> 
Sometimes, the swap partition is detected to have neither Linux nor Windows 
info and the "No signature found" error appears. I exactly don't know why this
happens, but for that case, I have written the code in swap????.sh files to 
try six times before reporting an error. Normally, the DOS signature should be 
found on the first try, but many a times on my system it is found on iteration 
2, 5 or not at all after 12 iterations. You may consider increasing the number 
of tries to some value like 12 or 24, there is no harm in doing so. Once on my 
system, the script could not detect the signatures even after 50 iterations ! 
If such a situation arises, you may consider making a symbolic link to the 
swapinit.sh file in your root home directory, and execute it at startup. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       
# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/swapinit.sh swapinit.sh 
# ./swapinit.sh  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, what I have observed is that once the setup runs on your system for
some time, the appropriate signatures are always found on the first iteration.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><P><B>For added reliability</B>
<P>Your Linux Box runs something very important, or your system memory is less
so that without swapping, your applications just start collapsing ? You have
set up the swap partition to be shared by Windows. But many a times, your
system is unable to detect the proper signatures after exhaustive probing
and so disables any swapping partitions. <B>At your own risk</B>, you may 
consider removing the signature checking logic, but here is a more
approachable solution. 
<P>First refer to the 
<A HREF="#swapfile">previous point</A> and create
a swap file in the Linux root directory, with the name /swap. Keep it's size 
according to your requirement. Now open the swapinit.sh file and modify the 
last <CODE>if</CODE> statement as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
if [ $activated -ne 1 ] ; then 
  echo "Swap signature not found after $loopcount tries" 
  echo "Activating swap file"
  swapon /swap
  exit 1 
fi 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thus if we find that swap partition lacks appropriate swap signatures, then
we enable the swap file. Since the swap file is on the root partition and
the Linux Kernel refuses to proceed until it mounts the root file system,
you are safely assured that the swap file will always be successfully
activated. Instead of creating and keeping the swap file and wasting disk
space, you may also modify the code to create the swap file <EM>on the 
fly</EM>.
<P>

<LI><P><B>Saving more disk space</B>
As we saw, Linux and Windows can share their swap spaces. But Window doesn't
really require as large a swap file as your Linux swap partition ? Then you
can have some free space on the swap partition (keep the Windows swap file
size smaller than the swap partition size). Swapping for Windows based
applications is managed by Windows itself. But many DOS programs like
Turbo C++ Compiler, Norton DOS etc. also manage their own swap files. In 
that case it is possible to configure these programs so that they create
their swap files in the swap partition instead of their default location.
This will increase your usable disk space. Also, most of these program
forget to delete the swap files they created, leading to a large used disk
space. But with this setup, every time you shut down Linux, you get a clean
swap partition, saving your time in finding and deleting these swap files.
For example, you can tell Turbo C++ to swap on drive say E: by invoking it
as
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
C:\CLAN>TC /RE
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

For Norton DOS, set the variable in the NDOS.INI file as,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Swapping = E:\
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Many other programs may rely on the <CODE>TEMP</CODE> or <CODE>TMP</CODE>
environment variables to decide where they will swap. In that case you may
set these variables appropriately in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><P><B> What if the swap partition is a FAT32 ? </B>
No, you can't have a swap partition with a FAT32 file system. First of all, 
Linux can use a maximum of 128MB of swap space on a single swap partition. 
Thus, if your swap partition is larger than 128MB, you are wasting your disk 
space. And Windows will refuse to convert a partition of 128MB into a FAT32 
file system. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><P><B>The new style swap space </B>
Linux knows about two styles of swap areas, the old style and the new style. 
By default, you will be using the old style swap space with a signature 
"SWAP-SPACE". If you want to use the new style swap space, then first of all 
change "SWAP-SPACE" in all the above scripts to "SWAPSPACE2". Also add an 
option -v1 in the mkswap command in the swapinit.sh script, as follows 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
/sbin/mkswap -v1 /dev/winswap YYYYY 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Also, run the following commands from the shell prompt : 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   
# swapoff /dev/winswap 
# mkswap -v1 /dev/winswap YYYYY 
# swapon /dev/winswap 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It seems that under new style swap space, your usable swap partition can be as
large as 2GB on i386 platforms. This means that you can now have a swap 
partition larger than 512MB which Windows can format as a FAT32 partition . 
Someone help on how do we save the "Total Special Sectors" under a FAT32 
partition.

<LI><P><B>For users of WINE</B>
<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com">WINE</A> is a program which allows
running Microsoft Windows programs on Linux. If you are using WINE on a system 
that has been set up to share swap partition, then when running a Windows program
a <CODE>win386.swp</CODE> file of about 8kb is created in your Windows folder. This is
because the swap file on X: is not available at that time. You can safely delete
this file once you finish running your Windows programs.
