<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Inter-Process Communication</A></H2>

<P>The example program that we have seen above is what is known as a realtime process.
Not every part of a application program need be written in realtime. It is found 
that only that part of a program which requires precise time restrictions should 
be written as a realtime process. Others can be written and executed in user space.
User spaces processes are often easier to write, execute and debug than realtime 
threads. But then, there should be a way to communicate between user space Linux
processes and realtime thread.
<P>
<P>There are several ways for inter-process communication. We will discuss the 
most important and common way of communication - the realtime FIFO.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Realtime FIFO</A>
</H2>

<P>Realtime FIFOs are unidirectional queues (First In First Out). So at one end a
process writes data into the FIFO, and from the other end of the FIFO, 
information is read by another process. Usually, one of these processes is 
the realtime thread and the other is a user space process. 
<P>
<P>The Realtime FIFOs are actually character devices (/dev/rtf*) with a major
number of 150. Realtime threads uses integers to refer to each FIFO (for 
example - 2 for /dev/rtf2). There is a limit to the number of FIFOs. There 
are functions such as rtf_create(), rtf_destroy(), rtf_get(), rtf_put() 
etc for handling the FIFOs.
<P>On the other hand, the Linux user process sees the realtime FIFOs as normal
character devices. Therefore the functions such as open(), close(), read() and
write() can be used on these devices. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Application Using FIFO</A>
</H2>

<P>First, let us consider a simple C program (filename pcaudio.c) to play music 
(of just two tones) through the PC speaker. For the time being, let us assume 
that for playing the note, we need only write to the character device /dev/rtf3. 
(Later, we will see a realtime time process that reads from this FIFO (/dev/rtf3) 
and sends to the PC speaker)
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define DELAY 30000

void make_tone1(int fd)
{
        static char buf = 0;
        write (fd, &amp;buf, 1);
}

void make_tone2(int fd)
{
        static char buf = 0xff;
        write (fd, &amp;buf, 1);
}

main()
{
        int i, fd = open ("/dev/rtf3", O_WRONLY);
        while (1)
        {
                for (i=0;i&lt;DELAY;i++);
                make_tone1(fd);
                for (i=0;i&lt;DELAY;i++);
                make_tone2(fd);
        }
}
</PRE>
<P>Now, if the above shown program (pcaudio.c) is compiled and run, it should create 
regular sound patters corresponding to a square wave. 
But before that we need a module for reading from '/dev/rtf3' and sending the 
corresponding data to the PC speaker. This realtime program can be found 
at the rtlinux source tree (/usr/src/rtlinux/examples/sound/) . Insert the module 
sound.o using the command 'insmod'. 
<P>Since we have inserted a module for reading from the device, we can now execute
our program (compile using 'gcc' and then execute the corresponding 'a.out'. 
So the process produces somewhat regular 
tones, when there is no other (time consuming) process in the system. But,
when the X server is started in another console, there comes more prolonged
silence in the tone. Finally, when a 'find' command (for a file in /usr
directory) is executed, the sound pattern is completely distorted. The 
reason behind this is that, we are writing the data onto the FIFO in 
non-realtime.
<P>
<P>We will, now, see how to run this process in realtime, so that the sound 
is produced without any kind of 
disturbance. First, we will convert the above program into a realtime program.
(Filename rtaudio.c)
<PRE>
#include &lt;rtl.h>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtl_fifo.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

#define FIFO_NO 3
#define DELAY 30000
pthread_t thread;

void * sound_thread(int fd)
{
        int i;
        static char buf = 0;
        while (1)
        {
                for(i=0; i&lt;DELAY; i++);
                buf = 0xff;
                rtf_put(FIFO_NO, &amp;buf, 1);

                for(i=0;i&lt;DELAY;i++);
                buf = 0x0;
                rtf_put(FIFO_NO, &amp;buf, 1);
        }
        return 0;
}

int init_module(void)
{
        return pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, sound_thread, NULL);
}

void cleanup_module(void)
{
        pthread_delete_np(thread);
}
</PRE>
<P>
<P>
<P>If not already done, 'plug in' the module sound.o into the kernel. Compile
the above program by writing a Makefile for it (as said earlier), 
thus producing the module 'rtaudio.o'. 
Before inserting this module, one more thing. Note that the
above program runs into infinite loop. Since, we have not included code
for the thread to sleep or stop, the thread will not cease its execution. In short,
your PC speaker will go on producing the tone, and you will have to restart
your computer for doing anything else.
<P>
<P>  
So, let us change the code a little bit (only in the function sound_thread()) 
by asking the thread itself to make the delay between tones.
<P>
<PRE>
void * sound_thread(int fd)
{
        static char buf = 0;
        pthread_make_periodic_np (pthread_self(), gethrtime(), 500000000);

        while (1)
        {
                pthread_wait_np();
                buf = (int)buf^0xff;
                rtf_put(FIFO_NO, &amp;buf, 1);
        }
        return 0;

}
</PRE>
<P>This time we can stop the process by just removing the module by using 
the 'rmmod' command.
<P>
<P>Here, we have seen how realtime FIFOs can be used for inter-process 
communication. Also the real need for RTLinux can be understood from the
above example.
