<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Booting Problems</A>
</H2>

<P> Booting problems are generally rare, and generally only occur on old and buggy,
or somehow non-compliant hardware.  Booting problems can be associated with a number
of problems, depending upon at what point during the boot process the failure occurs.
The following are possible causes of failure when booting from a CD.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Old or buggy BIOSes that do not fully support the eltorito standard.  System
may fail to load the isolinux bootloader or the kernel.</LI>
<LI> Problematic CDROM drives can cause various problems when booting the CD.
CD may or may not boot, and will generally have trouble accessing files
on the CD.</LI>
<LI> Damaged CD, obviously can cause a number of problems, similar symptoms as
above.</LI>
<LI> Insufficient hardware resources.  Please see the "Minumum Requirements"
section of this howto for more information on what is required to boot
the CD.</LI>
<LI> In the case of booting the Sentry Firewall CD, old or buggy floppy disk
drives or damaged floppy disks can also result in serious problems, including
curruption of the data on the floppy disk.  The inability for the configuration
scripts to read and parse files contained on the floppy disk can seriously inhibit
the capability of the system to configure itself properly.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In general, hardware issues cause the majority of problems during the boot process
of the Sentry Firewall CD, and may not always be easy to diagnose.  Generally, the
first step in debugging a general boot problem is to try and boot another CD in the
same machine to attempt to rule out a hardware problem.  And then attempt to boot
the Sentry Firewall CD in another machine to attempt to rule out damage to the CD.
If both these tests produce no negative results, then perhaps swap out the CDROM drives
in the two machines, if possible, and do the test again.  Then perhaps check out the
general mailing list(mentioned below) for further assistance.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Configuration Problems</A>
</H2>

<P> This section deals with configuration problems with the "sentry.conf" file.
The sentry.conf configuration file, as mentioned in previous sections, tells the
configuration scripts what to do during boot time to configure the running system.
Syntax errors in the script can cause a file to be misplaced, or for the directive
to not be parsed at all.
<P>Error messages during the boot process of the Sentry Firewall CD can help greatly
in diagnosing potential syntax or other types of errors.  So watch the CD boot and
write down any error messages that may pop up.  Also, during bootup a logfile
detailing the configuration process is created at /var/log/SENTRY_LOG.  If
you can log in to the system after it has booted, then take a look at this file for
any obvious error messages.
