<P>Linux is a fascinating operating system because it lets any
user participate in its development. The variety of available
languages, however, can be confusing to beginning Linux
developers. This document lists the most common options for
everyday development and states some key facts about them. (Well,
``most common'' and ``key'' as I perceive them.)
<P>My aim is neither to review the languages nor to determine
which one is the best.  Each language is a tool that fits some
jobs and some tastes. You can get further (often conflicting)
information easily, if you ask around or keep your ears open. The
Links sections in this document will give you some pointers for
your own research.
<P>There is a plethora of languages and libraries for Linux, so
this document only covers the most common languages and GUI
(Graphical User Interface) toolkits at the moment. This document
is intended to be fairly neutral, but I haven't included all
languages available. Since my judgment is undoubtedly biased in
many ways, I advise serious developers to check out the sites that
do a better job in listing all languages and libraries. Also note
that only the Linux implementations of the languages and GUI
toolkits are covered, their features on other platforms are not
discussed or implied.
<P>This document is a recent addition to the LDP, so there has not
been opportunity for much community feedback. However, it is
released in hopes that it will prove useful for people interested
in programming under Linux, especially beginners. A question mark
in the tables indicates lack of information. If you can fill it
in, please contact the author.

</H2>

<P>I am thankful to several people who commented on language
issues.  These conversations have given me a better view of the
different languages, and I hope future conversations will allow
this mini-HOWTO to mature over time. Especially I would like to
thank the people at the IRCNet channel #linux: Morphy, Bluesmurf,
Vadim, Zonk^, Rikkus and others whose names I have
forgotten. Thanks go also to Stig Erik Sandoe for helpful
comments.

<P>The 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">Hacker FAQ</A> by Eric S.  Raymond is another interesting text
for novice Linux developers. It concentrates on some cultural and
psychological aspects of open source development.  
<P>Other 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">LDP documents</A>
covering general programming subjects include the Reading List
HOWTO and the Linux Programmer's Guide - several more have been
written on specific subjects.
