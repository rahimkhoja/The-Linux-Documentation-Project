<P>If you chose to go this route, you need to make sure you have a rescue
partition somewhere -- a place to write out new copies of the files you
recover.  Hopefully, your system has several partitions on it: perhaps a
root, a <CODE>/usr</CODE>, and a <CODE>/home</CODE>.  With all these to choose from,
you should have no problem: just create a new directory on one of these.
<P>If you have only a root partition, and store everything on that, things are
slightly more awkward.  Perhaps you have an MS-DOS or Windows partition you
could use?  Or you have the ramdisk driver in your kernel, maybe as a
module?  To use the ramdisk (assuming a kernel more recent than 1.3.48), say
the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram0 bs=1k count=2048
# mke2fs -v -m 0 /dev/ram0 2048
# mount -t ext2 /dev/ram0 /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This creates a 2MB ramdisk volume, and mounts it on <CODE>/mnt</CODE>.
<P>A short word of warning: if you use <CODE>kerneld</CODE> (or its replacement
<CODE>kmod</CODE> in 2.2.x and later 2.1.x kernels) to automatically load and unload
kernel modules, then don't unmount the ramdisk until you've copied any files
from it onto non-volatile storage.  Once you unmount it, <CODE>kerneld</CODE>
assumes it can unload the module (after the usual waiting period), and once
this happens, the memory gets re-used by other parts of the kernel, losing
all the painstaking hours you just spent recovering your data.
<P>If you have a Zip, Jaz, or LS-120 drive, or something similar, it would
probably be a good choice for a rescue partition location.  Otherwise,
you'll just have to stick with floppies.
<P>The other thing you're likely to need is a program which can read the
necessary data from the middle of the partition device.  At a pinch, <CODE>dd</CODE>
will do the job, but to read from, say, 600 MB into an 800 MB partition,
<CODE>dd</CODE> insists on reading but ignoring the first 600 MB.  This takes a not
inconsiderable amount of time, even on fast disks.  My way round this was to
write a program which will seek to the middle of the partition.  It's called
<CODE>fsgrab</CODE>; you can find the source package on
<A HREF="http://pobox.com/~aaronc/tech/fsgrab-1.2.tar.gz">my website</A>
or on
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/file/">Metalab</A>
(and mirrors).  If you want to use this method, the rest of this mini-Howto
assumes that you have <CODE>fsgrab</CODE>.
<P>If none of the files you are trying to recover were more than 12 blocks long
(where a block is usually one kilobyte), then you won't need <CODE>fsgrab</CODE>.
<P>If you need to use <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> but don't want to download and build it, it
is fairly straightforward to translate an <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> command-line to one
for <CODE>dd</CODE>.  If we have
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
fsgrab -c <EM>count</EM> -s <EM>skip</EM> <EM>device</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>then the corresponding (but typically much slower) <CODE>dd</CODE> command is
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
dd bs=1k if=<EM>device</EM> count=<EM>count</EM> skip=<EM>skip</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I must warn you that, although <CODE>fsgrab</CODE> functioned perfectly for me, I can
take no responsibility for how it performs.  It was really a very quick and
dirty kludge just to get things to work.  For more details on the lack of
warranty, see the `No Warranty' section in the <CODE>COPYING</CODE> file included with
it (the GNU General Public Licence).
