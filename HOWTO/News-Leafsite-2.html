<P>Leafnode is available at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.troll.no/pub/freebies/">ftp://ftp.troll.no/pub/freebies/</A> and has been developed by
Arnt Gulbrandsen, an employee of Troll Tech AS. The recent version is
1.4 and in some distributions (for example Debian), Leafnode is
included. However, be sure to use at least version
1.4 as several critical bugs were fixed.
