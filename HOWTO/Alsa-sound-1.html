<P>This is the ALSA Sound drivers mini-HOWTO. It gives you information about
installing and using the ALSA sound drivers for your soundcard. The ALSA
drivers are fully modularized sound drivers that support kerneld and
kmod. They are compatible with, but surpass the possibilities of, the current
OSS API. In other words: compatible, but better.

<P>This documents contains information I got from the ALSA driver page. The
structure was ripped off the SB-mini-HOWTO, mainly because it had about
the structure I was looking for. Thanks to the 
<A HREF="http://www.sgmltools.org">SGML</A>
Tools package, this HOWTO is available in several formats, all generated
from a common source file. Thanks to Erik Warmelink for proof
reading, thanks to Alfred Munnikes
for a couple of questions and helpful suggestions. Yamahata Isaku thanks for the Japanese
translation, Miodrag Vallat for the translation in French. Later on, Steve Crowder did a great 
job by reading and editing the whole text. Thanks to Cserna Zsolt for the Hungarian translation and Marco Meloni for
the Italian one.
Thanks to Mohamed Ismail Mohamed-Ibrahim who sent me a document about the Trident 4DWave DX/NX soundcard
with a lot of useful information, thanks to Gerard Haagh who sent me a lot of useful information and
who also pointed out a few unclear sections.
