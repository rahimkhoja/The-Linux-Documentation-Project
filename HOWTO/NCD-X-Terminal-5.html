<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Configuring the NCD X terminal Boot Process</A></H2>

<P>After being powered up, the X terminal attempts to boot. This is the
process where the X software is loaded into memory and executed. If the X
terminal cannot boot, the Boot Monitor prompt '>' will appear. The Boot
Monitor is firmware found in terminal PROMs (programmable read-only
memory). With the basic Boot Monitor interface, it is possible to configure
the terminal to boot and retrieve its X server software from the host. Use
'?' for a list of Boot Monitor commands.
<P>
<P>Configuration parameters set with the boot monitor are stored in NVRAM
(Non-volatile Random-Access Memory) and are retained when the terminal is
powered down.
<P>
<P>From the boot monitor, the 'bt' command or a menu system can be used to
boot the terminal. Functionality of the two methods largely overlaps but
the menu provides control over more boot parameters.

containing the X server software used by the X terminal to boot (eg

in the X terminal entry in the bootptab file on the host (explained in the
previous section).
<P>
<DT><B><B>terminal_IP</B></B><DD><P>The IP address assigned to the X terminal (eg

<P>The setup menus are accessed by pressing the 'Setup' key or
typing 'se' from the boot monitor '>' prompt. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><B>Get IP Addresses From</B></B><DD><P>The IP address of the X terminal should
be obtained from boot monitor configuration stored in NVRAM. Only select
'Network' if you are using RARP (reverse ARP) to retrieve the X terminal's
IP address from the remote host.
<P>
<DT><B><B>Terminal IP Address</B></B><DD><P>The IP address assigned to the X terminal
(eg 10.0.0.2). This is the same as 'terminal_IP' parameter above.

(eg 10.0.0.1). This is the same as 'host_IP' parameter above.
<P>
<DT><B><B>Gateway IP Address</B></B><DD><P>The IP address of the subnet gateway. This
is the same as 'gateway' parameter above.
<P>
<DT><B><B>Subnet Mask</B></B><DD><P>The subnet mask, specified as a decimal IP
address. This is the same as the 'subnet_mask' parameter above.
<P>
<DT><B><B>Broadcast IP Address</B></B><DD><P>The IP address used to broadcast to the
subnet. (eg 10.255.255.255)
<P>
<DT><B><B>Boot File</B></B><DD><P>The name of the file retrieved from the remote
host containing the X server software used by the X terminal to boot (eg
"Xncd19r"). This is the same as 'file' parameter described above.
<P>
<DT><B><B>TFTP Boot Directory</B></B><DD><P>The name of the directory on the host
which contains the boot file (eg "/usr/X11/lib/X11/ncd/" or "/tftpboot/").

(See below).

(eg "/usr/X11/lib/X11/ncd/").

when booting from a host using BootP.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 X Terminal Configuration Files</A>
</H2>

<P>During the boot process, the X terminal will attempt to transfer and load
files from the boot host. These files are not required for the
X terminal to boot successfully. If a file is not found, the terminal
will use default settings. 
<P>Configuration Files transferred to the X terminal at boot time:
<UL>
<LI>X terminal configuration file (eg ncd.conf) used 
to retain terminal settings.</LI>
<LI>Color file (eg rgb.txt).</LI>
<LI>X key symbol database (eg XKeysymDB).</LI>
<LI>Font directory files (eg font.dir, font.alias).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>After a successful boot, the X terminal console window with a
menu bar should appear. The terminal setup key toggles display of this
console window. From the console window 'setup' pull-down menu, terminal
characteristics can be viewed, altered and saved on the boot host in the
configuration file which can be used in future sessions.
<P>If TFTP is being used to transfer files from the boot host, then file
permission must be world readable. Similarly, to save a configuration file
to the boot host, the file must already exist and with world write
permission enabled. If secure TFTP is used (this is recommended for
security reasons), then file access is possible only through specified
directories.
<P><B>Note:</B> The terminal may fail to boot if it was previously
configured to work with other hosts or with different configuration
parameters. Resetting the NVRAM to remove stored settings may solve the
problem. 
<P>
<P>To reset NVRAM, from the boot monitor, type the 'nv' command. From this
sub-menu, select 'l' to load defaults, 's' to save and finally 'q' to
quit. Resume the boot procedure described above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Logging on to the host</A>
</H2>

<P>From the X terminal console window menu bar, select the 'terminals'
pull-down menu and choose 'New Telnet...'. When the telnet window appears,
insert the address of a network host in the service entry and click
'OK'. The host log in prompt should appear. After logging in, X programs,
including a window manager, can be started from the telnet window.
