<P>This document is a step by step guide meant to 
provide information in order 
to help you running Linux on SPARC based computers,
As these computers are quite different from PCs 
an  hardware section will provide you with the needed information in
order to understand how they work and what can be expected from the
various CPUs and models.
<P>I am not a SPARC specialist, nor a Solaris or Linux guru, I am just
someone who is realy found of well engineered products, and  wish to
help you in choosing your hardware and finding information. Thus I
have tried to write down this document in order to ease your path.
<P> 
I hope this HOWTO will help you and you will have a lot of fun
with your SPARC Computer.
