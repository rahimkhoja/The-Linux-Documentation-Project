<P>Sometime in August, WordPerfect 7.0 for Linux should ship.  It should
be available from       
<A HREF="http://www.sdcorp.com/wpunix.html">SDC</A> for 
about $149.99 for a competitive upgrade or $199.99 retail.
<P>
<P>Corel is working on porting their entire office suite to Java and 
releasing it as Corel Office for Java(TM).  This currently is in Beta
and works on Linux (I tried the first beta -- very slow).  Check out
<A HREF="http://officeforjava.corel.com/about.htm">http://officeforjava.corel.com/about.htm</A> for more information.
This promises to be something to watch.
<P>
<P>SDC is currently working on WPLinux 8 with an expected beta mid 1998 
and a release following by about 5 months.  SDC has indicated that
if there is not sufficient demand for WP for Linux, they will probably 
not ship it (they already stopped shipping for SGI and UNIXWare) --
<B>so if you like it, buy it!</B>
