>Most modems support the addition of a password.  This is not
   particularly useful as it has the same strengths and weaknesses of
   all other password authentication schemes.  We already have
   password authentication in the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
>, in the boot
   loader and in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>login</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Many modems support call-back.  The modem is called and a few
   seconds after hang-up it calls a pre-configured number.  This
   limits the locations that can gain access to the console. </P
><P
>Many modems support checking the calling line identification
   (CLI) against a predefined list.  If the calling number is not on
   the list then the call is cleared.  The phone line to the modem
   must be configured to send CLI, this may incur an additional charge
   from the phone company.  Not all calling phones can send CLI and
   some valid callers may have asked their phone company to suppress
   the sending of CLI.</P
><P
>Many modems can be configured to log the calling line
   identification.  This is useful when tracing misuse.</P
><P
>Many modems support encryption.  Some modems allow multiple
   keys.  This gives a neat solution: only authorized modems can dial
   in, but they can do so from any location.  The modems usually need
   to be of the same make, and perhaps of the same model.</P
