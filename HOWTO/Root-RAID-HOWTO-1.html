<P>The reader is assumed to be familiar with the various types of raid
implementations, their advantages and drawbacks. This is not a tutorial,
just a set of instructions on how to implement root mounted raid on a linux
system. All
of the information necessary to become familiar with linux raid is listed
here directly or by reference, please read it before send e-mail questions.

</H2>

<P>As of this writing, the problem of stopping a root mounted RAID device has
not yet been solved in a satisfactory way.  A work-around proposed by Ed
Welbon and implemented by Bohumil Chalupa is incorporated into this document
which eliminates the need for a long ckraid at each boot for raid1 and raid5
devices. Without the workaround, it is necessary to <B>ckraid</B> the <B>md</B> device 
each time the system is re-booted. On a large array this can cause a severe
availability performance degradation.  On my 6 gig RAID1 device running on a
Pentium 166 with 128 megs of ram, it takes well over half an hour to ckraid
:-(
after each re-boot. It takes over an hour on my 13 gig RAID5 array with a
20mb/sec scsi adaptor.
<P>The workaround stores the status of the array at 
shutdown on the <B>real</B> boot device and compares it to a reference status
placed there when the system is first built. If the status's match at
reboot, the superblock on the array is rebuilt on the next boot, otherwise 
the operator is notified of the status error and the rescue system is left
running with all the raid tools available.
<P>Rebuilding the superblock causes 
the system to ignore that the array was powered down without mdstop by 
marking all the drives as <B>OK</B>, as if nothing happened. This only works if
all the drives are OK at shutdown. If the array was operating with a bad
drive, the operator must remove the bad drive prior to restarting the md
device or the data can be corrupted. 
<P>None of this applies to raid0 which 
does not have to be mdstopped before shutdown.
<P>Final proposed solutions to this problem include a <B>finalrd</B> similar to
<B>initrd</B>, and <B>mdrootstop</B> which writes the <B>clean</B> flags to the array 
during  shutdown when it is mounted read only. I am sure there are others.
<P>In the mean time, the problem has been by-passed for now 
Please let me know when this problem is solved more cleanly!!!
