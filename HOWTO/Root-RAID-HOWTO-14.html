<P>This is the complex form of the linuxrc file for root mounted raid.
It must be processed with 'bash' or another shell that recognizes
shell functions.
<P>The advantage is that it is generic and is not dependent on startup
files and parameters located in the <B>initrd</B> image.
<P>A <B>Raid_Conf</B> parameter passed to <B>linuxrc</B> by the kernel at boot 
from lilo or loadlin contains a pointer to the boot devices and 
location the of
initial 2 raidboot files needed by <B>linuxrc</B> (<I>raidboot.etc and
raidboot.cfg placed by the shutdown script</I>).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>raidboot.etc</B> containing the 'tar'ed files:
<PRE>
        raid*
        mdtab*
        fstab
        lilo.conf               ( if applicable )
</PRE>

from the primary system that are transferred to the
initrd <B>/etc</B>etc directory at startup. With care, this file may
be edited if necessary when your system 'really' crashes.
<P><B>raidboot.cfg</B> contains the name of the boot partition in use
and applicable backup(s) as well as the path to the rest of 
the raid start up file used by <B>linuxrc</B>.
This file is normally created by the shutdown file
and may be created manually if necessary.
<P><B>raidboot.cfg</B> is of the form, 3 lines - no comments
<PRE>
        /dev/bootdev1 /dev/bootdev2 [/dev/bootdev3 ... and so on]
        raid-status/path 
        name_of_raidX.conf_file
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
the <B>raid-status/path</B> does not include the name of the mountpoint     
<P>the <B>raidX.conf</B> filename is that one found in /etc 
and normally used for <B>ckraid</B> and <B>mkraid</B>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The following additional files reside on the permanent raid boot partitions.
This is usually the same as above, but in emergency situations
may be loaded from anywhere they are available, such as a floppy boot disk.
<UL>
<LI><B>raidgood.ref</B> created by the command
cat /proc/mdstat | grep md0 > /{raid_status_path}/raidgood.ref
<P>     
See the 
<A HREF="Root-RAID-HOWTO-4.html#modify_shutdown">shutdown scripts</A>
for saving this file and the next
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>raidstat.ro</B> created at each shutdown by the shutdown rc file,
saving the exit status of the raid array.</LI>
</UL>
