>8. Good documentation practice</H1
><P
>The most important good documentation practice is to actually
write some!  Too many programmers omit this.  But here are two good
reasons to do it:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Your documentation can be your design document.</EM
>
The best time to write it is before you type a single line of code,
while you're thinking out what you want to do.  You'll find that the
process of describing the way you want your program to work in natural
language focuses your mind on the high-level questions about  what it should
do and how it should work.  This may save you a lot of effort later.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;<EM
>Your documentation is an advertisement for the 
quality of your code.</EM
>
Many people take poor, scanty, or illiterate documentation for a program as
a sign that the programmer is sloppy or careless of potential users' needs.
Good documentation, on the other hand, conveys a message of intelligence
and professionalism. If your program has to compete with other programs,
better make sure your documentation is at least as good as theirs lest
potential users write you off without a second look.
</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>This HOWTO wouldn't be the place for a course on technical writing
even if that were practical.  So we'll focus here on the formats and tools
available for composing and rendering documentation.</P
><P
>Though Unix and the open-source community have a long tradition of
hosting powerful document-formatting tools, the plethora of different
formats has meant that documentation has tended to be fragmented and
difficult for users to browse or index in a coherent way.
We'll summarize the uses, strengths, and weaknesses of the common 
documentation formats. Then we'll make some recommendations for good
practice.</P

>8.1. Documentation formats</H2
><P
>Here are the documentation markup formats now in widespread use among
open-source developers.  When we speak of "presentation" markup, we mean
markup that controls the document's appearance explicitly (such as a font
change).  When we speak of "structural" markup, we mean markup that
describes the logical structure of the document (like a section break or
emphasis tag.)  And when we speak of "indexing", we mean the process 
of extracting from a collection of documents a searchable collection
of topic pointers that users can employ to reliably find material
of interest across the entire collection.</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
>man pages</DT
><DD
><P
>The most most common format, inherited from Unix, a primitive form of
presentation markup.
<SPAN
CLASS="citerefentry"
><SPAN
CLASS="refentrytitle"
>man</SPAN
>(1)</SPAN
>
command provides a pager and a stone-age search facility.  No support for
images or hyperlinks or indexing. Renders to Postscript for printing fairly
well.  Doesn't render to HTML at all well (essentially as flat text).
Tools are preinstalled on all Linux systems.</P
><P
>Man page format is not bad for command summaries or short reference
documents intended to jog the memory of an experienced user.  It starts to
creak under the strain for programs with complex interfaces and many
options, and collapses entirely if you need to maintain a set of documents
with rich cross-references (the markup has only weak and normally unused
support for hyperlinks).</P
></DD
><DT
>HTML</DT
><DD
><P
>Increasingly common since the Web exploded in 1993-1994. Markup is
partly structural, mostly presentation. Browseable through any web browser.
Good support for images and hyperlinks.  Limited built-in facilities for
indexing, but good indexing and search-engine technologies exist and are
widely deployed.  Renders to Postscript for printing pretty well.  HTML
tools are now universally available.</P
><P
>HTML is very flexible and suitable for many kinds of documentation.
Actually, it's <EM
>too</EM
> flexible; it shares with man page
format the problem that it's hard to index automatically because a lot of the 
markup describes presentation rather than document structure.</P
></DD
><DT
>Texinfo</DT
><DD
><P
>Texinfo is the documentation format used by the Free Software
Foundation. It's a set of macros on top of the powerful TeX formatting
engine. Mostly structural, partly presentation.  Browseable through Emacs
or a standalone <B
CLASS="command"
>info</B
> program.  Good support for
hyperlinks, none for images.  Good indexing for both print and on-line
forms; when you install a Texinfo document, a pointer to it is
automatically added to a browsable "dir" document listing all the Texinfo
documents on your system.  Renders to excellent Postscript and useable
HTML.  Texinfo tools are preinstalled on most Linux systems, and available
at the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Free Software Foundation</A
>
website.</P
><P
>Texinfo is a good design, quite usable for typesetting books as well
as small on-line documents, but like HTML it's a sort of amphibian &#8212; the
markup is part structural, part presentation, and the presentation part
creates problems for rendering. </P
></DD
><DT
>DocBook</DT
><DD
><P
>DocBook is a large, elaborate markup format based on SGML (more
recent versions on XML).  Unlike the other formats described here it is
entirely structural with no presentation markup.  Excellent support for
images and hyperlinks.  Good support for indexing.  Renders well to HTML,
acceptably to Postscript for printing (quality is improving as the tools
evolve).  Tools and documentation are available at the <A
HREF="http://www.docbook.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>DocBook website</A
>.</P
><P
>DocBook is excellent for large, complex documents; it was designed
specifically to support technical manuals and rendering them in multiple
output formats.  Its main drawback is its verbosity.  Fortunately, good
tools and introductory-level documentation are now available; see the
<A

TARGET="_top"
>DocBook Demystification

> for an introduction.</P
></DD
><DT
>asciidoc</DT
><DD
><P
>The one serious drawback of DocBook is that its markup is rather
heavyweight and obtrusive.  A clever recent workaround is <A
HREF="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/"
TARGET="_top"
>AsciiDOC</A
>. This tool is a
front end to DocBook with a much simpler and more natural input
syntax. Users don't need to be aware of DocBook at all, but still get
nearly the full power of those tools.</P
><P
>AsciiDOC (often referred to by the all-lower-case name of the
formatter it ships) has been seeing very rapid uptake recently by 
projects which had previously moved to DocBook.</P

>8.2. Good practice recommendations</H2
><P
>Documentation practice has been changing since 2000, when some key
open-source project groups (including the Linux kernel project, GNOME, KDE,
the Free Software Foundation, and the Linux Documentation Project) agreed
on an approach more web-friendly than traditional Unix's print-oriented
tools.  Today's best practice, since the XML-DocBook toolchain reached
production status in mid-2001, is this:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Maintain your document masters in either XML-DocBook or asciidoc.
Even your man pages can be DocBook <TT
CLASS="sgmltag"
>RefEntry</TT
> documents.
There is a very good <A

on writing manual pages that explains the sections and organization your
users will expect to see.</P

>
(standard on all Red Hat distributions since 7.3), ship the troff sources
that you get by running conversions on your masters. Your
software distribution's installation procedure should install those in
the normal way, but direct people to the XML/asciidoc files if they want to write
documentation patches.</P
