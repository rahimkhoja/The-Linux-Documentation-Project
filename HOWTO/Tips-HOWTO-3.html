<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Sharing swap partitions between Linux and Windows. <I>Tony Acero,</I> <CODE>ace3@midway.uchicago.edu</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> Format the partition as a dos partition, and create the Windows
swap file on it, but don't run windows yet. (You want to keep the swap
file completely empty for now, so that it compresses well).
</LI>
<LI> Boot linux and save the partition into a file.  For example if the partition was /dev/hda8:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dd if=/dev/hda8 of=/etc/dosswap
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI> Compress the dosswap file; since it is virtually all 0's it will compress very well
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
gzip -9 /etc/dosswap
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI> Add the following to the /etc/rc file to prepare and install the swap space under Linux:

<EM>XXXXX is the number of blocks in the swap partition</EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mkswap /dev/hda8 XXXXX
swapon -av   
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Make sure you add an entry for the swap partition in your /etc/fstab file
</LI>
<LI> If your init/reboot package supports /etc/brc or /sbin/brc add the
following to /etc/brc, else do this by hand when you want to boot to
dos|os/2 and you want to convert the swap partition back to the
dos/windows version:</LI>
</OL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
swapoff -av
zcat /etc/dosswap.gz | dd of=/dev/hda8 bs=1k count=100
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

# Note that this only writes the first 100 blocks back to the partition. I've found empirically that this is sufficient 
<P>&gt;&gt;  What are the pros and cons of doing this?
<P>Pros: you save a substantial amount of disk space.
<P>Cons: if step 5 is not automatic, you have to remember to do it by hand,
and it slows the reboot process by a nanosecond :-)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Desperate Undelete. <I>Michael Hamilton,</I> <CODE>michael@actrix.gen.nz</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Here's a trick I've had to use a few times.
<P>Desperate person's text file undelete.
<P>If you accidentally remove a text file, for example, some email, or
the results of a late night programming session, all may not be lost.
If the file ever made it to disk, ie it was around for more than 30
seconds, its contents may still be in the disk partition.
<P>You can use the grep command to search the raw disk partition for the
contents of file.
<P>For example, recently, I accidentally deleted a piece of email.
So I immediately ceased any activity that could modify that partition:
in this case I just refrained from saving any files or doing any compiles
etc.  On other occasions, I've actually gone to the trouble of bring the
system down to single user mode, and unmounted the filesystem.
<P>I then used the egrep command on the disk partition:  in my case the email
message was in /usr/local/home/michael/, so from the output from df,
I could see this was in /dev/hdb5
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  sputnik3:~ % df
    Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
    /dev/hda3              18621    9759     7901     55%   /
    /dev/hdb3             308852  258443    34458     88%   /usr
    /dev/hdb5             466896  407062    35720     92%   /usr/local

    sputnik3:~ % su
    Password:
    [michael@sputnik3 michael]# egrep -50 'ftp.+COL' /dev/hdb5 > /tmp/x
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now I'm ultra careful when fooling around with disk partitions, so I
paused to make sure I understood the command syntax BEFORE pressing
return.  In this case the email contained the word 'ftp' followed by
some text followed by the word 'COL'.  The message was about 20 lines
long, so I used -50 to get all the lines around the phrase.  In the
past I've used -3000 to make sure I got all the lines of some source
code.  I directed the output from the egrep to a different disk
partition - this prevented it from over writing the message I was
looking for.
<P>I then used strings to help me inspect the output
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   strings /tmp/x | less
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Sure enough the email was in there.
<P>This method can't be relied on, all, or some, of the disk space may
have already been re-used.
<P>This trick is probably only useful on single user systems.  On
multi-users systems with high disk activity, the space you free'ed up
may have already been reused.  And most of use can't just rip the box
out from under our users when ever we need to recover a file.
<P>On my home system this trick has come in handy on about three
occasions in the past few years - usually when I accidentally trash
some of the days work.  If what I'm working survives to a point where
I feel I made significant progress, it get's backed up onto floppy, so
I haven't needed this trick very often.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 How to use the immutable flag. <I>Jim Dennis,</I> <CODE>jadestar@rahul.net</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>Use the Immutable Flag
<P>Right after you install and configure your system
go through the /bin, /sbin/, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin and
/usr/lib (and a few of the other usual suspects and
make liberal use of the 'chattr +i command'.  Also add that
to the the kernel files in root.  Now 'mkdir /etc/.dist/'
copy everything from /etc/ on down (I do this in two steps
using /tmp/etcdist.tar to avoid recursion) into that directory.
(Optionally you can just create /etc/.dist.tar.gz) -- and
mark that as immutable.
<P>The reason for all of this is to limit the damage that you can
do when logged in as root.  You won't overwrite files with a
stray redirection operator, and you won't make the system
unusable with a stray space in an 'rm -fr' command (you might
still do alot of damage to your data -- but your libs and
bins will be safer.
<P>This also makes a variety of security and denial of service
exploits either impossible or more difficult (since many of
them rely on overwriting a file through the actions of some
SUID program that *isn't providing an arbitrary shell command*).
<P>The only inconvenience of this is when building and
doing your 'make install' on various sorts of system binaries.
On the other hand it also prevents the 'make install' from
over-writing the files.  When you forget to read the Makefile
and chattr -i the files that are to be overwritten (and the
directories to which you want to add files) -- the make fails,
you just use the chattr command and rerun it.  You can also
take that opportunity to move your old bin's, libs, or whatever
into a .old/ directory or rename or tar them or whatever.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 A suggestion for where to put new stuff.</A>
<I>Jim Dennis,</I> <CODE>jadestar@rahul.net</CODE></H2>

<P>All new stuff starts under /usr/local! or /usr/local/`hostname`
<P>If your distribution is one that leaves /usr/local empty
then just create your /usr/local/src, /usr/local/bin etc
and use that.  If your distribution puts things in the /usr/local
tree than you may want to 'mkdir /usr/local/`hostname`' and
give the 'wheel' group +w to it (I also make it SUID and SGID
to insure that each member of the wheel group can only mess with
their own files thereunder, and that all files created will
belong to the 'wheel' group.
<P>Now discipline yourself to *ALWAYS! ALWAYS! ALWAYS!* put new
packages under /usr/local/src/.from/$WHEREVER_I_GOT_IT/
(for the .tar or whatever files) and build them  under
/usr/local/src (or .../$HOSTNAME/src).  Make sure that it
installs under the local hierarchy.  If it *absolutely must*
be installed back in /bin or /usr/bin or somewhere else --
put a symlink from the local heirarchy to each element that
when anywhere else.
<P>The reason for this -- even though it's more work -- is that
it helps isolate what has to be backed up and restored or
reinstalled in the event of a full re-install from the
distribution medio (usually CD these days).  By using a
/usr/local/.from directory you also keep an informal log
of where your sources are coming from -- which helps when
you're looking for new updates -- and may be critical when
monitoring the security announcement lists.
<P>One of my systems at home (the one I'm calling from)
was put together before I adopted these policies for myself.
I still don't "know" all the ways that it differs from the
stock "as installed" system.  This is despite the fact that
I've done very little with my home system's configuration
and I'm the *only* person who ever uses it.
<P>By contrast the systems I've set up at work (when I was thrust
into the role of system administrator there) have all been
configured this way -- have been administered by many
contractors and other MIS people, and have had a large number
of upgrades and package installations.  Nonetheless I have a
very good idea which precise elements were put in *after*
the initial installation and configuration.

</H2>

<P>
<P>I noticed a few overly difficult or unnecessary procedures recommended
in the 2c tips section of Issue 12.  Since there is more than one, I'm
sending it to you:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
         # lowerit
         # convert all file names in the current directory to lower case
         # only operates on plain files--does not change the name of directories
         # will ask for verification before overwriting an existing file
         for x in `ls`
           do
           if [ ! -f $x ]; then
             continue
             fi
           lc=`echo $x  | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
           if [ $lc != $x ]; then
             mv -i $x $lc
           fi
           done
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Wow.  That's a long script.  I wouldn't write a script to do that;
instead, I would use this command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
for i in * ; do [ -f $i ] &amp;&amp; mv -i $i `echo $i | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`;
done;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

on the command line.
<P>The contributor says he wrote the script how he did for
understandability (see below).
<P>On the next tip, this one about adding and removing users, Geoff is
doing fine until that last step.  Reboot?  Boy, I hope he doesn't reboot
every time he removes a user.  All you have to do is the first two
steps.  What sort of processes would that user have going, anyway?  An
irc bot?  Killing the processes with a simple
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kill -9 `ps -aux |grep ^&lt;username> |tr -s " " |cut -d " " -f2`
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Example, username is foo
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kill -9 `ps -aux |grep ^foo |tr -s " " |cut -d " " -f2`
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

That taken care of, let us move to the forgotten root password.
<P>The solution given in the Gazette is the most universal one, but not the
easiest one.  With both LILO and loadlin, one may provide the boot
parameter &quot;single&quot; to boot directly into the default shell with no login
or password prompt.  From there, one may change or remove any passwords
before typing &quot;init 3&quot; to start multiuser mode.
Number of reboots: 1
The other way

<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 How To Upgrade Sendmail</A>
<I>Paul Anderson,</I> <CODE>paul@geeky1.ebtech.net</CODE></H2>

<P>We're starting from raw, clean source.  First, obtain the sendmail source code.
I've d/led version 8.9.0, which is, as you will notice, bleeding edge.
I grabbed it from ftp.sendmail.org:/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.9.0.tar.gz
<P>It's about 1Meg, and considering I'm running 8.7.6, I think it's worth the
effort.  If this works, you'll undoubtedly hear about it, elsewise
I can't get the new HOWTO versions out without e-mail:)
<P>Now, once you've got the source d/led, unpack it.  It'll create a dir called
<CODE>sendmail-8.9.0</CODE> in the current directory.  Change into that directory,
read the README and RELEASE_NOTES files(and be amazed at the updates they've
done).  Now, cd in src.  This is where most of your work will be done.
<P><EM>A quick note: Sendmail is a small, powerful and well-written program.
The sendmail binary itself compiled in less than 5 minutes on my
5x86 133 with 32Megs RAM!  The entire compile and install(sans config)
took under 15 minutes!</EM>
<P>I don't normally run BIND on my system, so I found the lines:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# ifndef NAMED_BIND
#  define NAMED_BIND    1       /* use Berkeley Internet Domain Server */
# endif
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and changed the 1 to a 0, ala:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# ifndef NAMED_BIND
#  define NAMED_BIND    0       /* use Berkeley Internet Domain Server */
# endif
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>On Debian 1.3.1, db.h is by default installed in /usr/include/db, instead
of /usr/include, where sendmail hopes to find it.  Change to the src, 
mailstats, makemap, praliases, rmail and smrsh directories and execute
the following command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 ./Build -I/usr/include/db
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Once you've done that, cd .. and type make install.  There!  Sendmail
version 8.9.0 should now be installed!  This is, of course, assuming you
already have your original configuration.  For everything to work smoothly
on my system, since I host free mailing lists for people using majordomo,
I had to add the following to the beginning of my /etc/sendmail.cf:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
O DontBlameSendmail=forwardfileinunsafedirpath, forwardfileinunsafedirpathsafe
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sendmail 8.9.0 is rather pedantic about directory and file permissions
these days, and will complain about dirs and files in aliases or .forward
files that are group or world writeable.  While it's not a good idea
to disable this pedantry, I am only running with a single person at
the console and I felt it was okay to allow this minor security
hole.  YMMV.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Some tips for new sysadmins.</A>
<I>Jim Dennis,</I> <CODE>jadestar@rahul.net</CODE></H2>

<P>Create and maintain a /README.`hostname` and/or a
/etc/README.`hostname`
<EM>[Or possibly /usr/local/etc/README.`hostname` -Maint. ]</EM>
<P>Absolutely, from *day one* of administering a system
take notes in an online log file.  You might make
&quot;vi /README.$(hostname)&quot; a line in root's &nbsp;/bash_logout.
Another way to do this is to write an su or a sudo script
that does something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                function exit \
                        { unset exit; exit; \
                          cat ~/tmp/session.$(date +%y%m%d) \
                          >> /README.$(hostname) &amp;&amp; \
                          vi /README.$(hostname)
                          }
                script -a ~/tmp/session.$(date +%y%m%d)
                /bin/su.org -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(use the typescript command to create a session log
and create a function to automate appending and updating
the log).
<P>I'll admit that I haven't implemented this automation of
policy -- I've just relied on self-discipline so far.
However I have been toying with the idea (even to the
point of prototyping the scripts and shell functions as you
see them).  One thing that holds me back on this is
the 'script' command itself.  I think I'll have to grab the
sources and add a couple of command line parameters (to
pause/stop the script recording from the command line) before
I commit to using this).
<P>My last suggestion (for this round):
<P>Root's path should consist of 'PATH=&nbsp;/bin'
<P>That's it.  Nothing else on root's path.  Everything root
does is provided by a symlink from &nbsp;/bin or by an alias or
shell function, or is a script or binary in &nbsp;/bin, or is
typed out with an explicit path.
<P>This makes anyone running as root aware (sometimes painfully
so) of how he or she is trusting binaries.  The wise admin
of a multi-user host will periodically look through his or
here &nbsp;/bin and &nbsp;/.*history files to look for patterns and
loopholes.
<P>The really motivated admin will spot sequences
that can be automated, places where sanity checks can be
inserted, and tasks for which &quot;root&quot; privileges should be
temporarily eschewed (launching editors, MTA's and other
large interactive programs with elaborate scripting features
that *might* be embedded in transparent or data files --
like the infamous vi ./.exrc and emacs ./.emacs and the
even more insidous $EXINIT and the embedded header/footer
macros).  Naturally those sorts of commands can be run
with something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                cp $data $some_users_home/tmp
                su -c $origcommand $whatever_switches
                cp $some_users_home/tmp $data
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(...where the specifics depend on the command).
<P>Mostly these last sorts of precautions are overboard for the
home or &quot;single&quot; user workstation -- but they are very good
policy the admin of a multi-user -- particular a publicly
exposed system (like the one's at netcom).
