A kilobyte (kB) is 1000 bytes.
A megabyte (MB) is 1000 kB.
A gigabyte (GB) is 1000 MB.
A terabyte (TB) is 1000 GB.
This is the
<A HREF="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/prefixes.html">SI norm</A>.
However, there are people that use 1 MB=1024000 bytes and talk
about 1.44 MB floppies, and people who think that 1 MB=1048576 bytes.
Here I follow the 
<A HREF="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">recent standard</A>
and write Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti for the binary units, so that
these floppies are 1440 KiB (1.47 MB, 1.41 MiB),
1 MiB is 1048576 bytes (1.05 MB),
1 GiB is 1073741824 bytes (1.07 GB)
and 1 TiB is 1099511627776 bytes (1.1 TB).
<P>Quite correctly, the disk drive manufacturers follow the SI norm
and use the decimal units. However, Linux kernel boot messages
(for not-so-recent kernels) and some old fdisk-type programs
use the symbols MB and GB for binary, or
mixed binary-decimal units. So, before you think your disk is
smaller than was promised when you bought it, compute first the
actual size in decimal units (or just in bytes).
<P>Concerning terminology and abbreviation for binary units,
<A HREF="http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Knuth</A>
has an alternative 
<A HREF="http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/news99.html">proposal</A>, namely
to use KKB, MMB, GGB, TTB, PPB, EEB, ZZB, YYB and to call these
<I>large kilobyte</I>, <I>large megabyte</I>, ... <I>large yottabyte</I>.
He writes: `Notice that doubling the letter connotes both
binary-ness and large-ness.' This is a good proposal -
`large gigabyte' sounds better than `gibibyte'. For our purposes
however the only important thing is to stress that a megabyte
has precisely 1000000 bytes, and that some other term and abbreviation
is required if you mean something else.
