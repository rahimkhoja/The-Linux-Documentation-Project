<H2><A NAME="Floppies"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Floppies, Hard Disks, and the Like </A></H2>

<P>
<P>There are two ways to manage devices under Linux: the DOS way and the UNIX
way. Take your pick.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Managing Devices the DOS Way</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Most Linux distributions include the Mtools suite, a set of commands that
are perfectly equivalent to their DOS counterpart, but start with an `m':
i.e., <CODE>mformat</CODE>, <CODE>mdir</CODE>, <CODE>mdel</CODE>, <CODE>mmd</CODE>, and so
on. They can even preserve long file names, but not file permissions. If you
configure Mtools editing a file called /etc/mtools.conf (a
sample is provided in the distribution), you can also access the DOS/Win
partition, the CD--ROM, and the Zip drive. To format a fresh disk though,
the <CODE>mformat</CODE> command won't do. As root, you'll have to issue this
command beforehand: <CODE>fdformat /dev/fd0H1440</CODE>.
<P>You can't access files on the floppy with a command like, say, <CODE>less
a:file.txt</CODE>! This is the disadvantage of the DOS way of accessing disks.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Managing Devices the UNIX Way</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>UNIX has a different way to handle devices. There are no separate volumes
like A: or C:; a disk, be it a floppy or whatever, becomes part of the local
file system through an operation called ``mounting''. When you're done using
the disk, before extracting it you must ``unmount'' it.
<P>Physically formatting a disk is one thing, making a file system on it is
another. The DOS command <CODE>FORMAT A:</CODE> does both things, but under
Linux there are separate commands. To format a floppy, see above; to create
a file system:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkfs -t ext2 -c /dev/fd0H1440
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can use <CODE>dos</CODE>, <CODE>vfat</CODE> (recommended) or other formats
instead of <CODE>ext2</CODE>. Once the disk is prepared, mount it with the
command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>specifying the right file system if you don't use <CODE>ext2</CODE>. Now you can
address the files in the floppy using <CODE>/mnt</CODE> instead of A: or B:.
Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DOS                                     Linux
---------------------------------------------------------------------

C:\GUIDO>DIR A:                         $ ls /mnt
C:\GUIDO>COPY A:*.*                     $ cp /mnt/* .
C:\GUIDO>COPY *.ZIP A:                  $ cp *.zip /mnt
C:\GUIDO>EDIT A:FILE.TXT                $ jstar /mnt/file.txt
C:\GUIDO>A:                             $ cd /mnt
A:> _                                   /mnt/$ _
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When you've finished, before extracting the disk you <EM>must</EM> unmount
it with the command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# umount /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Obviously, you have to <CODE>fdformat</CODE> and <CODE>mkfs</CODE> only unformatted
disks, not previously used ones. If you want to use the drive B:, refer to
<CODE>fd1H1440</CODE> and <CODE>fd1</CODE> instead of <CODE>fd0H1440</CODE> and
<CODE>fd0</CODE> in the examples above.
<P>Needless to say, what applies to floppies also applies to other devices; for
instance, you may want to mount another hard disk or a CD--ROM drive. Here's
how to mount the CD--ROM:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This was the ``official'' way to mount your disks, but there's a trick in
store. Since it's a bit of a nuisance having to be root to mount a floppy or
a CD--ROM, every user can be allowed to mount them this way:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> as root, do the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkdir /mnt/floppy ; mkdir /mnt/cdrom
# chmod 777 /mnt/floppy /mnt/cd*
# # make sure that the CD-ROM device is right
# chmod 666 /dev/hdb ; chmod 666 /dev/fd*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI> add in /etc/fstab the following lines:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom  iso9660 ro,user,noauto          0       0
/dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy vfat    user,noauto             0       0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>Now, to mount a DOS floppy and a CD--ROM:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mount /mnt/floppy
$ mount /mnt/cdrom
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>/mnt/floppy and /mnt/cdrom
can now be accessed by every user. Remember that allowing everyone to mount
disks this way is a gaping security hole, if you care.
<P>Two useful commands are <CODE>df</CODE>, which gives information on the mounted
file systems, and <CODE>du dirname</CODE> which reports the disk space consumed
by the directory.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="Backing Up"></A> <A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Backing Up </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are several packages to help you, but the very least you can do for a
multi-volume backup is (as root):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tar -M -cvf /dev/fd0H1440 dir_to_backup/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Make sure to have a formatted floppy in the drive, and several more ready.
To restore your stuff, insert the first floppy in the drive and do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tar -M -xpvf /dev/fd0H1440
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
