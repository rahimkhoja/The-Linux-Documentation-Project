>      After several questions on what partitioning
      really is, I'll just quote an answer I gave in 
      a mail once.
    </P
><P
>      Okay, here goes:
    </P
><P
>      In an operating system you need several different filesystems
      for several different applications.  For example, you need a
      swap filesystem because your main memory can't hold all
      information the operating system needs, so some of it has to be
      temporary written to disk. You may also need some special
      filesystem from which the machine reads the operating system
      when you switch it on.  Finally, you need of course one or more
      filesystems to store the operating system program files and your
      user files. It may be a good idea to put these in different
      places (ie. on different filesystems) in case you have to
      reinstall the operating system, but don't want to scratch all
      your work.
    </P
><P
>      The best thing is maybe to have all these filesystems on
      different disks. But one has seldom more than one or two disks
      in a computer. So what we do is to slice up the disk(s) in
      several slices (partitions) and use the slices for several
      filesystems. Then the operating system mounts the filesystems
      together to one single file tree, so it is easy to access the
      files.
    </P
><P
>      (Other operating systems, like MS-DOS and NT use
      some other technology: They do not bind the slices
      together to one file tree, but keeps them separate
      as "stations". What is the best scheme? You figure!)
    </P
><P
>      Here a thought example with one 2GB disk on a 7248:
      The mount point shows where in the file tree a
      filesystem is mounted.

>      If you want, you could add own partitions for important
      directories like /home,  /boot, /var, /usr/local and
      so on. Here is an other example with two disks,
      actually my own configuration with two disks:

>          GNU/Linux often uses the old partition scheme from MS-DOS. This means
          that if there are more than 4 partitions on one disk, one uses
          an extended partition (sda4) that may hold several logical
          partitions (sda5, sda6, sda7, ...)

>          Yes, my partition scheme is a bad one. My root partition was
          filled up in a couple of weeks or so. Don't use it.  It is an
          example only.
