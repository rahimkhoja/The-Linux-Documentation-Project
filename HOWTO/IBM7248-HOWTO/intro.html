>      This document describes how to install GNU/Linux on the IBM
      RS/6000 43P 7248 series, that is, the 43P-100, 43P-120 and
      43P-133. It describes quite in detail anything to get one of
      these boxes from a non working stage to a networked workstation
      with a nice graphical user interfase. This relase covers several
      Linux distributions. Earlier, this document described the
      installation of several Linux distributions. Earlier, it only
      covered the LinuxPPC distribution, which is now obsolete. If
      you, for any particular reason, should be interested in versions
      of LinuxPPC, please have a look at <A

    </P

>      Some years ago I got a couple of old 7248s for free and I did
      not have any OS to run on them. So I gathered some bits and
      pieces from the net, and got it to install LinuxPPC-1999. Later,
      I found that a lot of other people may have the same problems
      that I had, so I wrote this document to help. Later I rewrote it
      in SGML and it is now a part of the LDP.
