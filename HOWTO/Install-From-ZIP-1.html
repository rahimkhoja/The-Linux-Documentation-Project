<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Intro:</A>
</H2>

<P>The following method has been written for use with the Slackware 
Linux distribution. It assumes some familiarity with it's 
installation. The installer will also need access to a working Linux 
system of any distribution.  It also assumes the destination system 
has 4 to 6 megs ram.  More powerful systems can use this method also 
but you will probably be able to find a faster easier way.  It is not 
intended to be used by first time installers or by people new to Linux. 
Only issues specific to the use of a zip drive as source media will be 
covered here.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Background:</A>
</H2>

<P> 
I have an OLD 486/20 slc with a 120 meg hd, 4 megs ram and a 2400 
baud modem that I wanted to run Linux on. It has no cdrom drive or 
pcmcia connectivity, and will never see a network card (parallel port 
style). There is nothing left that can be upgraded on this unit. 
<P>Linux has been at the cutting edge from the start but also breathes 
new life into some older 386 and 486 hardware.  The documentation 
says "386 with 2 megs ram no math coprocessor" but try to find a 
distribution that will do it today.  Slackware can be placed on a 4 
meg machine with some work and a prayer. The following system greatly 
reduces the work.  Prayer always helps, even with the best of systems.
<P>I've  used the following system with 3 other laptops, and one 386 
desktop machine. The lamest being a 386 with 4 megs ram &amp; 60 meg HD 
no math coprocessor.  While this system works well I'd like to be able 
to do similar tricks with Debian, RedHat, Caldera Lite, and some of 
the other popular distributions offering more choice to Linux users I 
help this way.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Advantages:</A>
</H2>

<P>Installing from cdrom or Ethernet are the methods of choice when 
available.  In cases where floppy disk install appears to be the only 
choice a parallel port zip drive offers numerous advantages.  These 
include better speed than a floppy disk, and fewer disk changes. In 
addition on systems with minimal ram "6 megs. or less" the ability to 
install a swap file on the root disk uncomplicates the install greatly 
by freeing you from the need to creat one on the hard disk before 
running setup. When installing Slackware the swap file allows 
installers to choose the <B>color.gz</B> root disk or <B>text.gz</B>. The <B>color.gz</B> is not recommended for floppy based 
installs on machines with such limited resources. With a zip disk you 
may also produce an emergency boot disk during the initial install, by 
freeing the first floppy drive. Something not possible during a normal 
floppy based install on systems of this type.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Material:</A>
</H2>

<P> 
This method has been used with Slackware Ver's. 3.1, through 3.4 
A full Slackware install requires 2 zip disk's not counting source 
packages if they are desired. You will need one parallel port zip 
drive &amp; cables, and a 1.44 meg boot disk. Pencil and paper are 
optional for making a few notes during install.
<P>At least two systems are required to use this install method. The 
first (host) system is used to prepare the installation media and 
must contain a working Linux system. The second will be the target 
system. Once the media has been prepared it can be used to install to 
as many target systems as you like.  I work from cdrom but you can 
down load your distribution from the Internet if you have a fast 
enough connection.  For me this is not practical.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
let (floppy)    represent the path to and directory you 
                mount your 1.44 meg floppy disk on.

let    (zip)    represent the path to and directory you 
                mount your zip disk on.

let  (cdrom)    represent the path to and directory you 
                mount your cdrom on.

let (verx.x)    represent the distribution version you
                are installing.

<P>If you down load your disk images please let (cdrom)/slakware the path 
and directory to those images.  My parallel port zip drive shows up on 
my system as
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

        /dev/sda4

I've never seen it come up as any thing else unless I run fdisk on it 
and change the partition table, creating more than one partition on 
the disk. Then I always get corrupt disk error messages when I try to 
use it. You may however mark the partition type 83 Linux etc... if 
you wish with out trouble.  You also need to know the device names of 
your cdrom and 1.44 meg floppy drives. Mine are
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

       /dev/hdc     cdrom
       /dev/fd0     1.44 meg floppy
     
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

I'll use my device names, you use yours ;-|)
<P>About Slackware and slakware (note the missing c in slakware). 
Slackware is the name of the overall distribution and slakware is the 
name of the directory where Patrick Volkerding places the stable "not 
experimental or developmental" packages for installation. Whenever 
I'm writing about slakware I'm writing about the directory.

<P>I also recommend the LOWMEM.TXT document from the Slackware 
documentation on your cdrom or Slackware ftp site. This document 
discribes a system that eleminates many of the difficulties discribed 
in that document.
