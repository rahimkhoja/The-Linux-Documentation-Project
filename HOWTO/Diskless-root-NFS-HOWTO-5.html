<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Added bonus: booting from cdrom</A> </H2>

<P>Much of the above also goes for booting from cdrom. Since I wanted to document
howto boot from cdrom anyway, I document it in here to avoid typing a lott
of the same twice.
<P>Why would one want to boot a machine from cd-rom? Booting from cdrom is
interesting everywhere where one wants to run a very specific application,
like a kiosk, a library database program or an intenet cafe, and one doesn't
have a network or a server to use a root over nfs setup.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Basic Principle</A>
 </H2>

<P>The basic principle is wants again simple, boot with a cdrom as root. To
make this possible we'll use the rockridge extension to put a unix like filesystem
on a cd and the Eltorito extension to make cd's bootable.
<H3>Things can't be that simple </H3>

<P>Ofcourse this setup also has a few problems. most are the same as above:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>We'll need write access to: /dev, /var &amp; /tmp.
<UL>
<LI>We'll just use the same solutions as with root over nfs (see above):
<UL>
<LI>For /dev we'll use Devfs</LI>
<LI>For /var and /tmp we'll use a shared ramdisk of 1mb. It's shared to use
the space as effeciently as possible. /tmp is replaced by a symlink to /var/tmp
to make the sharing possible.</LI>
<LI>Populating the ramdisk with tarballs or template dirs, works equally well.
But with template dirs it's much easier to make changes, thus we'll use template
dirs.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Some apps need write access to /home.
<UL>
<LI>Put the homedir of the user's who will be running the application in /var,
and populate it wiht the rest of /var every boot.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>/etc/mtab needs to be writable:
<UL>
<LI>Create a link to /proc/mounts and create an empty file mounts in /proc,
see above.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Creating a test setup.</A>
 </H2>

<P>Now that we know what we want todo and how, it's time to create a test
setup:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>For starters just take one of the machines which you want to use and put
in a big disk and a cd-burner.</LI>
<LI>Install your linux of choice on this machine, and leave a 650mb partition
free for the test setup. This install will be used to make the iso-image and
to burn the cd's from, so install the nescesarry tools. It will also be used
to restore any booboo's which leave the test setup unbootable.</LI>
<LI>On the 650 mb partition install your linux of choice with the setup you
want to have on the cd, this will be the test setup</LI>
<LI>Boot the test setup.</LI>
<LI>Compile a kernel as described in Section 3.1, follow all the steps, the
changes need for devfs are still needed! At step 3 of Section 3.1 put in the
following:
<UL>
<LI>isofs compiled in </LI>
<LI>devfs compiled in</LI>
<LI>cdrom support compiled in</LI>
<LI>everything else you need either compiled in or as module.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Configure the test setup:
<UL>
<LI>Create the user which we'll be running the application.</LI>
<LI>Put it's homedir in /var. </LI>
<LI>Install the application if needed.</LI>
<LI>Configure the application if needed.</LI>
<LI>Configure the user so that the application is automagicly run after login.</LI>
<LI>Configure linux so that it automaigcly logs in the user.</LI>
<LI>Configure anything else which needs configuring.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Test that the test setup automagicly boots into the apllication and everything
works.</LI>
<LI>Boot the main install and mount the 650 mb partition on /test of the main
install.</LI>
<LI>Put the following in a file called /test/etc/rc.d/rc.iso, this file we'll
be sourced at the begining of rc.sysinit to create /var
<HR>
<PRE>
#/var
echo Creating /var ...
mke2fs -q -i 1024 /dev/ram1 1024
mount /dev/ram1 /var -o defaults,rw
cp -a /lib/var /

#restore devfs settings, needs proc
mount -t proc /proc /proc
/etc/rc.d/rc.devfs restore /etc/sysconfig
umount /proc
  
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI>Edit /test/etc/rc.sysinit comment the lines we're the root is remounted
rw and add the following 2 lines directly afer setting the PATH:
<HR>
<PRE>
#to boot from cdrom
. /etc/rc.d/rc.iso
  
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI>Copying the following to a script and executing it, this wil create a template
for /var and make /tmp and /etc/mtab links.
<HR>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
echo tmp
rm -fR /test/tmp
ln -s var/tmp /test/tmp

###
echo mtab
touch /test/proc/mounts
rm /test/etc/mtab
ln -s /proc/mounts /test/etc/mtab

###
echo var
mv /test/var/lib /test/lib/var-lib
mv /test/var /test/lib
mkdir /test/var

rm `find /test/lib/var/lock -type f`
rm `find /test/lib/var/run -type f`

  
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI>Remove the creation of /etc/issue* from /test/etc/rc.local it will only
fail.</LI>
<LI>Now boot the test partition again, it will be read only just like a cdrom.
If something doesn't work reboot to the working partition fix it, try again
etc. Or you could remount / rw ,fix it then reboot straight into to test partition
again. To remount / rw type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mount -o remount,rw /
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Creating the cd</A>
 </H2>

<H3>Creating a boot image </H3>

<P>First of all boot into the workign partition. To create a bootable cd we'll
need an image of a bootable floppy. Just dd-ing a zimage doesn't work since
the loader at the beginning of the zimage doesn't seem to like the fake floppydrive
a bootable cd creates. So we'll use syslinux instead.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Get boot.img from a redhat cd</LI>
<LI>Mount boot.img somewhere through loopback by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mount boot.img somewhere -o loop -t vfat
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Remove everything from boot.img except for:
<UL>
<LI>ldlinux.sys</LI>
<LI>syslinux.cfg</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Cp the kernel-image from the test partition to boot.img.</LI>
<LI>Edit syslinux.cfg so that it contains the following, ofcourse replace zImage
by the appropiote image name:
<HR>
<PRE>
default linux 

label linux
kernel zImage
append root=/dev/&lt;insert your cdrom device here&gt;
  
</PRE>
<HR>
</LI>
<LI>Umount boot.img:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
umount somewhere
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>If your /etc/mtab is a link to /proc/mounts umount won't automagicly free
/dev/loop0 so free it by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
losetup -d /dev/loop0
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Creating the iso image </H3>

<P>Now that we have the boot image and an install that can boot from a readonly
mount it's time to create an iso image of the cd: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Copy boot.img to /test</LI>
<LI>Cd to the directory where you want to store the image make sure it's on
a partition with enough free space.</LI>
<LI>Now generate the image by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mkisofs -R -b boot.img -c boot.catalog -o boot.iso /test
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Verifying the iso image </H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Mounting the image throug the loopbackdevice by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mount boot.iso somewhere -o loop -t iso9660
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Now verify that the contents is ok.</LI>
<LI>Umount boot.iso:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
umount somewhere
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>If your /etc/mtab is a link to /proc/mounts umount won't automagicly free
/dev/loop0 so free it by typing:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Writing the actual cd </H3>

<P>Assuming that you've got cdrecord installed and configured for your cd-writer
type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
cdrecord -v speed=&lt;desired writing speed&gt; dev=&lt;path to your writers
generic scsi device&gt; boot.iso
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Boot the cd and test it</A>
