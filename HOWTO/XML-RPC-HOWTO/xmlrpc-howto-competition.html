HREF="http://www.corba.org/"

>CORBA</A
> is a popular
      protocol for writing distributed, object-oriented applications. It's
      typically used in multi-tier enterprise applications. Recently, it's
      also been adopted by the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>Gnome</A
> project for
      interapplication communication.</P
><P
>CORBA is well-supported by many vendors and several free
      software projects. CORBA works well with Java and C++, and is
      available for many other languages. CORBA also provides an excellent
      <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>interface definition language</I
> (IDL), allowing
      you to define readable, object-oriented APIs.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, CORBA is very complex. It has a steep
      learning curve, requires significant effort to implement, and
      requires fairly sophisticated clients. It's better-suited to
      enterprise and desktop applications than it is to distributed web
      applications.</P

HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/DCOM.asp"
TARGET="_top"
>DCOM</A
> is
      Microsoft's answer to CORBA. It's great if you're already using COM
      components, and you don't need to talk to non-Microsoft
      systems. Otherwise, it won't help you very much.</P

>3.3. XML-RPC vs. SOAP</A
></H2
><P
><A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/"
TARGET="_top"
>SOAP</A
> is very
      similar to XML-RPC. It, too, works by marshaling procedure calls
      over HTTP as XML documents. Unfortunately, SOAP appears to be
      suffering from specification creep.</P
><P
>SOAP was originally created as a collaboration between
      UserLand, DevelopMentor and Microsoft. The initial public release was
      basically XML-RPC with namespaces and longer element names. Since
      then, however, SOAP has been turned over a W3C working group.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, the working group has been adding a laundry-list
      of strange features to SOAP. As of the current writing, SOAP supports
      XML Schemas, enumerations, strange hybrids of structs and arrays, and
      custom types. At the same time, several aspects of SOAP are
      implementation defined.</P
><P
>Basically, if you like XML-RPC, but wish the protocol had more
      features, check out SOAP. :-)</P
