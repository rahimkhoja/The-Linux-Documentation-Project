<P>GNU YACC (Bison) comes with a very nice info-file (.info) which documents
the YACC syntax very well. It mentions Lex only once, but otherwise it's
very good. You can read .info files with Emacs or with the very nice 
tool 'pinfo'. It is also available on the GNU site: 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/manual/bison/">BISON Manual</A>.
<P>Flex comes with a good manpage which is very useful if you already
have a rough understanding of what Flex does. The
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/manual/flex/">Flex Manual</A> is also
available online.
<P>After this introduction to Lex and YACC, you may find that you need more
information. I haven't read any of these books yet, but they sound good:

<P>Thomas Niemann wrote a document discussing how to write compilers and
calculators with Lex &amp; YACC. You can find it 
<A HREF="http://epaperpress.com/y_man.html">here</A>.
<P>The moderated usenet newsgroup comp.compilers can also be very useful but
please keep in mind that the people there are not a dedicated parser
helpdesk! Before posting, read their interesting 
<A HREF="http://compilers.iecc.com/">page</A> and especially the 
<A HREF="http://compilers.iecc.com/faq.txt">FAQ</A>.
<P>Lex - A Lexical Analyzer Generator by M. E. Lesk and E. Schmidt is one of
the original reference papers. It can be found 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/lexpaper.htm">here</A>.
<P>Yacc: Yet Another Compiler-Compiler by Stephen C. Johnson is one of the
original reference papers for YACC. It can be found
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/yaccpaper.htm">here</A>.
It contains useful hints on style.
