- Build &#38; maintain a
city/country. You are required to build and maintain a city.
You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for your
residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help
of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for broke
and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and
resource starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite
resources available in any one place, this is not a game
that you can leave for long periods of time. This game is
similar to the commercial simulation game with a similar
name. This package provides files common to both the X and
SVGALIB versions of the game.

>Conway's Game of Life</A
> every cell
is either fully alive (has the value of 1) or completely
dead (has the value 0). In Real Life this restriction to
bivalence is lifted to countenance -real-valued- degrees
of life and death. Real Life contains Conway's Game of
Life as a special case; however, Real Life, in contrast to
Conway's Game of Life, exhibits sensitive dependence on
initial conditions which is characteristic of chaotic
systems."

MS-DOS and Windows 3.x. These were targeted at younger

>&#13;SimEarth, 1988, Maxis (DOS, Win3.x, Mac) Simulates the
development of a planet from the forming of the crust
to the spread of civilization. Based on James
Lovelock's Gaia theory. Somewhat dull and difficult to
learn, but there's a good amount of educational value
to be gotten out of fiddling around with the models,
particularly greenhouse effect.

>&#13;Balance of the Planet, 1991, Chris Crawford (DOS, Mac):
You take the role of a government policy-maker
who must try to balance industry and ecology.
Remarkably complicated and drab (even moreso than
SimEarth), but certain to be educational and
thought-provoking if time is spent with the manual.
The Mac version can now be downloaded for free from

>&#13;Global Effect, 1992, Millennium (DOS, Amiga):
An early real-time strategy game where you must try
to conquer your opponent while dealing with the
ecological ramifications of your weapons and
industry upon your population. Clunky interface,
not a lot of fun compared to current Warcraft-type
games.
</P

>&#13;SimIsle, 1995, Maxis (DOS, ???) Develop a
tropical island without destroying the
rainforest ecology. Large learning curve but
supposedly a lot of fun.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;SimPark, 1997, Maxis (Win 95, ???) Sort of a
children's version of SimIsle, which is
simpler and more education-focused.
