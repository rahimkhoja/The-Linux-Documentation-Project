<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Credits</A>
</H2>

<P>I'd like to thank Bear Giles for his Debian TTF howto which brought
me on the right path :o).
<P>Of course, credit should also go to the XFree86 crew for the enormous 
effort of maintaining XFree86, and Joerg Pommnitz for writing <CODE>ttmkfdir</CODE>.
<P>Also I'd like to pass a BIG big thank you to the LDP for building and
maintaining a network of helping hands which already guided many
people through the hard to overcome the learning curve Linux has.
<P>Thanks to Joe Meadows for notifying me that this howto probably described 
an illegal act in version 0.0.2 and earlier.

I don't know where to find them since the authors did not contact me,
(no wonder, I did not update since 2001). Please do continue to translate.
