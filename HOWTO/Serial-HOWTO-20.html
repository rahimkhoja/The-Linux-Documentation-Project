<H2><A NAME="ss20.1">20.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc20.1">Voltage for a Bit</A>
</H2>

<P> At the RS-232 serial port, voltages are bipolar (positive or
negative with respect to ground) and should be about 12 volts in
magnitude (some are 5 or 10 volts).   For the transmit and receive
pins +12 volts is a 0-bit (sometimes called "space") and -12 volts is
a 1-bit (sometimes called "mark").  This is known as inverted logic
since normally a 0-bit is both false and negative while a one is
normally both true and positive.  Although the receive and transmit
pins are inverted logic, other pins (modem control lines) are normal
logic with a positive voltage being true (or "on" or "asserted") and a
negative voltage being false (or "off" or "negated").  Zero voltage
has no meaning (except it usually means that the unit is powered off).</P>
<P>A range of voltages is allowed.  The specs say the magnitude of a
transmitted signal should be between 5 and 15 volts but must never
exceed 25 V.  Any voltage received under 3 V is undefined (but some
devices will accept a lower voltage as valid).  One sometimes sees
erroneous claims that the voltage is commonly 5 volts (or even 3
volts) but it's usually 11-12 volts.  If you are using a EIA-422
(RS-422) port on a Mac computer as an RS-232 (requires a special
cable) or EIA-423 (RS-423) then the voltage will actually be only 5 V.
The discussion here assumes 12 V.</P>
<P>Note that normal computer logic normally is just a few volts (5 volts
was once the standard) so that if you try to use test equipment
designed for testing 3-5 volt computer logic (TTL) on the 12 volts of a
serial port, it may damage the test equipment.</P>

<H2><A NAME="byte_seq"></A> <A NAME="ss20.2">20.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc20.2">Voltage Sequence for a Byte </A>
</H2>

<P> The transmit pin (TxD) is held at -12 V (mark) at idle when nothing
is being sent.  To start a byte it jumps to +12 V (space) for the
start bit and remains at +12 V for the duration (period) of the start
bit.  Next comes the low-order bit of the data byte.  If it's a 0-bit
nothing changes and the line remains at +12 V for another bit-period.
If it's a 1-bit the voltage jumps from +12 to -12 V.  After that comes
the next bit (-12 V if a 1 or +12 V if a 0), etc., etc.  After the
last data bit, a parity bit may be sent and then a -12 V (mark) stop
bit.  Then the line remains at -12 V (idle) until the next start bit.
Note that there is no return to 0 volts and thus there is no simple
way (except by a synchronizing signal) to tell where one bit ends and
the next one begins for the case where 2 consecutive bits are the same
polarity (both zero or both one).</P>
<P>A 2nd stop bit would also be -12 V, just the same as the first stop
bit.  Since there is no signal to mark the boundaries between these
bits, the only effect of the 2nd stop bit is that the line must remain
at -12 V idle twice as long.  The receiver has no way of detecting the
difference between a 2nd stop bit and a longer idle time between
bytes.  Thus communications works OK if one end uses one stop bit and
the other end uses 2 stop bits, but using only one stop bit is
obviously faster.  In rare cases 1 1/2 stop bits are used.  This means
that the line is kept at -12 V for 1 1/2 time periods (like a stop bit
50% wider than normal).</P>

<H2><A NAME="parity_def"></A> <A NAME="ss20.3">20.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc20.3">Parity Explained </A>
</H2>

<P> Characters are normally transmitted with either 7 or 8 bits of
data.  An additional parity bit may (or may not) be appended to this
resulting in a byte length of 7, 8 or 9 bits.  Some terminal emulators
and older terminals do not allow 9 bits.  Some prohibit 9 bits if 2
stop bits are used (since this would make the total number of bits too
large: 12 bits total after adding the start bit).</P>
<P>The parity may be set to odd, even or none (mark and space parity may
be options on some terminals or other serial devices).  With odd
parity, the parity bit is selected so that the number of 1-bits in a
byte, including the parity bit, is odd.  If a such a byte gets
corrupted by a bit being flipped, the result is an illegal byte of
even parity.  This error will be detected and if it's an incoming byte
to the terminal an error-character symbol will appear on the screen.
Even parity works in a similar manner with all legal bytes (including
the parity bit) having an even number of 1-bits.  During set-up, the
number of bits per character usually means only the number of data
bits per byte (7 for true ASCII and 8 for various ISO character sets).</P>
<P>A "mark" is a 1-bit (or logic 1) and a "space" is a 0-bit (or logic
0).  For mark parity, the parity bit is always a one-bit.  For space
parity it's always a zero-bit.  Mark or space parity (also known as
"sticky parity") only wastes bandwidth and should be avoided if
feasible.  The <CODE>stty</CODE> command can't set sticky parity but it's
supported by serial hardware and can be dealt with by programming in
C.  "No parity" means that no parity bit is added.   For terminals
that don't permit 9 bit bytes, "no parity" must be selected when using
8 bit character sets since there is no room for a parity bit.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss20.4">20.4</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc20.4">Forming a Byte (Framing)</A>
</H2>

<P> In serial transmission of bytes via RS-232 ports, the low-order
bit is always sent first (the bit-order).  Serial ports on PC's use
asynchronous communication where there is a start bit and a stop bit
to mark the beginning and end of a byte.  This is called framing and
the framed byte is sometimes called a frame.  As a result a total of
9, 10, or 11 bits are sent per byte with 10 being the most common.
8-N-1 means 8 data bits, No parity, 1 stop bit.  This adds up to 10
bits total when one counts the start bit.  One stop bit is almost
universally used.  At 110 bits/sec (and sometimes at 300 bits/sec) 2
stop bits were once used but today the 2nd stop bit is used only in
very unusual situations (or by mistake since it still works OK that
way but wastes bandwidth).</P>
<P>Don't confuse this type of framing with the framing used for a packet
of bytes on a network.  The serial port just frames every byte.  For a
network, many bytes are framed into a packet (sometimes called a
frame).  For a network frame, instead of a start bit, there is a
sequence of bytes called a header.  On a network that uses serial
ports (with modems), a report of a frame error usually refers to a
multi-byte frame and not the serial port frame of a single byte.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss20.5">20.5</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc20.5">How "Asynchronous" is Synchronized</A>
</H2>

<P> The RS-232 serial port as implemented on PC is asynchronous which
in effect means that there is no "clock" signal sent with "ticks" to
mark when each bit is sent..  There are only two states of the
transmit (or receive) wire: mark (-12 V) or space (+12 V).  There is
no state of 0 V.  Thus a sequence of 1-bits is transmitted by just a
steady -12 V with no markers of any kind between bits.  For the
receiver to detect individual bits it must always have a clock signal
which is in synchronization with the transmitter clock.  Such a clock
would generate a "tick" in synchronization with each transmitted (or
received) bit.</P>
<P>For asynchronous transmission, synchronization is achieved by framing
each byte with a start bit and a stop bit (done by hardware).  The
receiver listens on the negative line for a positive start bit and
when it detects one it starts its clock ticking.  It uses this clock
tick to time the reading of the next 7, 8 or 9 bits.  (It actually is
a little more complex than this since several samples of a bit are
normally taken and this requires additional timing ticks.)  Then the
stop bit is read, the clock stops and the receiver waits for the next
start bit.  Thus async is actually synchronized during the reception
of a single byte but there is no synchronization between one byte and
the next byte.</P>
