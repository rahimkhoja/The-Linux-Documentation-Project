>&#13;This system has been run on a 486SX33 with 8
megabytes of RAM.  It didn't run very well though, it had trouble
handling heavy traffic.
</P
><P
>&#13;It doesn't take much more to make it work though.  This system does work
very well on a Pentium 75 with 16 megs of RAM, using an LRP distribution
running off of a floppy, with a 6 meg ramdisk, and 10 megs of main
memory. I've tested this setup by running a 700kbit RealVideo stream
through it for over an hour.
</P
><P
>&#13;I now typically run it on Pentium 90s, as their PCI clocking plays
nicer with cheap 100Mbit Ethernet cards.

>&#13;This system works with both the 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.  The script to keep
the tunnel up requires a reasonably modern bash.  I have however noticed
that certain distribution's versions of bash don't play too well with
the script.
</P
><P
>&#13;Also, if someone could help me refine my scripts (or even write an
executable) that would help a lot.  I'm not sure why, but even
my own bash doesn't follow the rules and doesn't seem to interpret
signals correctly.  If you do make any improvements, please email me at
