<!--

In designing the disk layout it is important not to split off the
directory tree structure at the wrong points, hence this section.
As it is highly dependent on the FSSTND it has been put aside in
a separate section, and will most likely have to be totally rewritten
when FHS is adopted in a Linux distribution.
In the meanwhile this will do.
<P>Remember that this is a list of where a separation <EM>can</EM> take place,
not where it <EM>has</EM> to be. As always, good judgement is always required.
<P>Again only a rough indication can be given here. The values indicate

<P>There is of course plenty of adjustments possible, for instance a home user
would not bother with splitting off the <CODE>/var/spool</CODE> hierarchy but
a serious ISP should. The key here is <EM>usage</EM>.
<P><EM>QUIZ!</EM> Why should <CODE>/etc</CODE> never be on a separate partition?
Answer: Mounting instructions during boot is found in the file
<CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> so if this is on a separate and unmounted partition
it is like the key to a locked drawer is inside that drawer, a hopeless
situation. (Yes, I'll do nearly anything to liven up this HOWTO.)
