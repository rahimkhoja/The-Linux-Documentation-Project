<P>
<P>I've got a notebook I installed Linux on, beside Windows 95 that was
pre--installed. I squeezed the Windows partition to 500 Mb, making space for
a 240 Mb Linux one. Small though the latter may seem, I've managed to
install a fairly complete Linux system on it, based on Red Hat 4.1 and some
magic to save as much space as possible.
<P>If you're in need for space, the indications you'll find in the following
sections will free up a considerable chunk of hard disk. The only caveat I'm
giving you is: don't blame me if something goes wrong! We'll be using a
couple of programs that worked fine for me, but are inherently dangerous.
You've been warned.
