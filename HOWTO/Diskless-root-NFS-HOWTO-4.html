<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Adding workstations</A> </H2>

<P>Now that the server is all done, we can start adding workstations.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Creating a boot disk or bootrom</A>
 </H2>

<P>You'll need ot create a bootrom and / or a bootdisk to boot your workstation.
<H3>Creating a bootdisk </H3>

<P>Even if you wish to use a bootrom its wise to first test with a bootdisk,
to create a boot disk just type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
dd if=/&lt;path-to-zImage&gt;/zImage of=/dev/fd0
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Creating a bootrom </H3>

<P>There are a few free package's out there to create bootroms:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>netboot, this is IMHO the most complete free package out there. It uses
standard dos packet drivers so allmost all cards are supported. One very usefull
hint I got on there mailing list was to pklite the packetdrivers since some
commercial drivers are to big to fit into the bootrom. Netboot's documentation
is complete enough, so I won't waste any time reproducing it here, it should
be more then sufficient to create a bootrom and boot a ws with it. Netboot's
webpage is: http://www.han.de/~gero/netboot/</LI>
<LI>etherboot, this is the other free package out there it has got a few nice
features like dhcp support, but has limited driver support as it uses its own
driver format. I haven't used this so I really can't give anymore usefull info.
Etherboot's webpage is: http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/</LI>
</OL>
<P>About the roms themselves. Most cards take ordinary eproms with an 28 pins
dip housing. These eproms come in size upto 64kB. For most cards you'll need
32kB eproms with netboot. Some cards drivers will fit into 16kB but the price
difference of the eproms is minimal. These eproms can be burned with any ordinairy
eprom burner.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Creating a ws dir</A>
 </H2>

<P>Just copy over the template by typing:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
cd /tftpbootcp -a template &lt;ip&gt;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You could of course also copy over the dir of a workstation with identical
mouse, graphicscard and monitor and ommit the configuration in step 5.4.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Add entries to /etc/bootptab and /etc/hosts</A>
 </H2>

<P>Edit /etc/bootptab and add an entry for your test ws, an example entry
is:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
nfsroot1:hd=/tftpboot:vm=auto:ip=10.0.0.237:\ 
:ht=ethernet:ha=00201889EE78:\
:bf=bootImage:rp=/tftpboot/10.0.0.237/root
 
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Replace nfsroot1 by the hostname you want your ws to have. Replace 10.0.0.237
by the ip you want your ws to have (do this twice) and replace 00201889EE78
by the MAC-ADDRESS of your ws. If you don't know the MAC-ADDRESS of the ws,
just boot it with the just created boot disk and look for the MAC-ADDRESS in
the boot messages. There's a chance bootpd is already running so just to make
sure try to restart it by typing:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
killall -HUP bootpd
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Don't worry if it fails, that just means it wasn't running, inetd will
start it when asked too.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Booting the ws for the first time</A>
 </H2>

<P>Just boot the ws from the bootdisk. This should get you a working ws in
textmode, with the exact same setup as your server except for the ip-nr and
the running services. Even if you want to use a bootprom it's wise to first
test with the bootdisk, if that works you can try to boot with the bootrom
see the bootroms documentation for more info.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Set the ws specific configuration.</A>
 </H2>

<P>Now it's time to configure any ws specific settings:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>First off all to get the mouse working, just run mouseconfig. To apply
the changes, and check that the mouse works type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
/etc/rc.d/init.d restart
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Run Xconfigurator, when Xconfigurator has probed the card and you can press
ok don't! Since we have moved the symlink for the Xserver from /etc/X11/X to
/etc/sysconfig/X11/X Xconfigurator will fail to create the proper link. Thus
to make sure the rest of Xconfigurator goes well, switch to another console
and create the link in /etc/sysconfig/X11 to the advised server. Now just finish
Xconfigurator and test X.</LI>
<LI>Configure anything else which is different then the server / template:
<UL>
<LI>sound: You probaly need to modify isapnp.conf and conf.modules, both are
already made links to /etc/sysconfig by the server setup script.</LI>
<LI>cdrom: Link in /dev, entry in /etc/fstab? etc.</LI>
<LI>rc.local: Make any nescesarry changes.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Save the links and any other changes to /dev type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
/etc/rc.d/rc.devfs save /etc/sysconfig
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>All done.</LI>
