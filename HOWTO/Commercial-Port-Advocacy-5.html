<H2><A NAME="s5">5. The art of cold contacting</A></H2>

<P>What you will be doing is known in the fund-raising business
as "cold contacting."  This means that your "target" company
won't have known that you'll be contacting it, and won't have
been primed to hear your message.  A 1% response rate is
considered normal.  You should be able to do better than
that.
<P>In a sense all target companies will be slightly primed to
hear about Linux due to the remarkable amount of publicity it's
been getting of late.  In that respect your contact won't be
completely cold.  That's good.
<P>The first thing to do is to identify someone in the company to
contact.  It's always best (if possible) to identify an actual
individual rather than a job title.  Depending on the size of the
company and its organizational structure, your best bet is the
head of program development.  If that isn't a possibility, try
for the head of whatever technical section the company may have. 
If <EM>that</EM> isn't possible, read over whatever bios might be
available in the "about the company" section of the company's web
site (they almost all have something like this) and pick the
person who seems most likely to be intrigued by Linux and to
become an internal advocate for a Linux port.  Finally, if none
of the above things works try contacting the head of the company. 
Incidentally, it won't hurt to contact more than one person in
the company if your bio research shows somebody other than the
head of program development as the most likely person to be
interested.
<P>Your initial contact should probably be via email.  First,
email usually goes directly to the person addressed rather than
being filtered through various layers of the organization as
postal mail and telephone calls are.  Second, with email everyone
starts equal.  Physical presentation and elocution don't enter
into the contact, so the logic of the message may be more
apparent.
<P>The subject of your message should be understated.  "Make
Millions Easily!" will just get your message deleted as spam. 
Try something like "A good new market for your programs," or "An
overlooked market for your software."
<P>The first sentence in your message should probably be a
conditional apology for sending the message to the wrong person
if the person receiving it is the wrong person.  The next
sentence should request that the message be forwarded to the
right person and that that person's email address be sent back to
you for future contacts.  This has a few effects.  The apology
establishes that you're not a know-it-all and that you are
polite.  The request reinforces the politeness and quietly lets
it be known that this won't be a one-time contact.  That's
important.  It's a lot easier to blow off a message if you don't
think you'll ever hear from the writer again.
<P>That brings up another point.  If things work out right, you
won't be making just a one-time contact with this company.  You
will be signing up to be an outside contact for them, a source of
information about things Linux.  As such, there are some
guidelines to follow in all your contacts.  Be polite.  Be
patient.  Be truthful.  Be helpful.  Stay apart from internal
politics.
<P>Be polite means responding civilly to all messages, even if
you consider them insulting or moronic.  Remember, "A soft answer
turneth away wrath."  Besides, it's just possible that you may
have misunderstood the message.  Asking for a restatement of the
message to clear up its meaning can't hurt.
<P>Be patient means answering what you consider obvious questions
calmly and clearly, and answering them as many times as
necessary.  Email isn't real-time; you can take a jog around to
block to cool down before answering yet another, "But doesn't a
Linux port mean we'd be expected to give our products away?"
message.
<P>Be truthful means answering each question to the best of your
ability, and saying "I don't know" when that's the correct
answer.  However, "I don't know" is only the first part of that
answer; "but I'll find out and get back to you" is the rest of
it.
<P>Be helpful means going beyond just answering the immediate
question and trying to address the reasons the question was
asked.  For example, one company asked me how it could publicize
the existence of a Linux port if it did one.  I mentioned the
standard places (comp.os.linux.announce, Linux Weekly News,
Freshmeat, Slashdot, Linux Journal).  Then I brought the question
up in the seul-dev-apps mailing list.  The discussion there
eventually started the development of the 
<A HREF="http://linuxunited.org/projects/news/">lu-news system</A>.
<P>Stay apart from internal politics means keeping a little
distance between yourself and your company contact.  However
friendly your exchanges are, your role shouldn't be one of
confidante but one of outside expert and advocate.  You won't
force the company into supporting Linux.  You can only make sure
they know about the opportunity and help them find the best way
to take advantage of it.
<P>You should probably be prepared to answer questions about why
no one else in the target company's market niche is developing
for Linux (if that's indeed the case), and what capabilities are
available in Linux, such as multimedia.  Are the available media
players exploitable commercially?  Do they run efficiently?  You
might also make the point that a port to Linux of a graphical
program will mean a port to the X Window System and will mean
that the program is much easier to port to any other OS that uses
X, such as Solaris, AIX, or HPUX.
<P>Andrew Mayhew brought up this point to me, and it makes a lot
of sense:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It has been my (albeit limited) experience that
structuring the
email/letter sent to companies with the idea that I or one of my
clients is actually interested in their product at the beginning
(or as
closely as reasonable) of the document gets more results.  Now,
this is
only really applicable is you mean it.
