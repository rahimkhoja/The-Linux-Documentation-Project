<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is a VPN?</A>
</H2>

<P>A 
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?VPN">Virtual Private Network</A>, or &quot;VPN&quot;, is a tunnel that carries
private network traffic from one endpoint system to another over a public
network (such as the Internet) without the traffic being aware that there
are intermediate hops between the endpoints, or the intermediate hops being
aware they are carrying the network packets that are traversing the tunnel.
The tunnel may optionally compress and/or encrypt the data, providing
enhanced performance and some measure of security.
<P>The &quot;Virtual&quot; part stems from the fact that you are constructing
a private link over a public network, rather than actually buying a direct
hardwired link over leased lines. The VPN allows you to pretend you are
using a leased line or direct telephone call to communicate between the endpoints.
<P>You may find the VPN FAQ at
<A HREF="http://kubarb.phsx.ukans.edu/~tbird/vpn/FAQ.html">http://kubarb.phsx.ukans.edu/~tbird/vpn/FAQ.html</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 What is IPsec?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?IPsec">IPsec</A></B>
is a set of standard protocols for implementing secure communications
and encryption key exchange between computers. It can be used to implement
a VPN.
<P>An IPsec VPN generally consists of two communications channels between the
endpoint hosts: a key-exchange channel over which authentication and
encryption key information is passed, and one or more data channels over
which private network traffic is carried.
<P>The key-exchange channel is a standard UDP connection to and from port 500. The
data channels carrying the traffic between the client and server use IP
protocol number 50 (ESP).
<P>More information is available in F-Secure's IPsec FAQ at
<A HREF="http://www.Europe.F-Secure.com/support/vpn+/faq/techfaq.html">http://www.Europe.F-Secure.com/support/vpn+/faq/techfaq.html</A>,
and in
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2402.html">RFC2402</A>
(the AH protocol, IP protocol number 51),
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2406.html">RFC2406</A>
(the ESP protocol, IP protocol number 50),
and
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2408.html">RFC2408</A>
(the ISAKMP key-exchange protocol).
<P>IPsec is a peer-to-peer protocol. However, since most people will be
exposed to it in the form of an originate-only Windows client being used to
access a central network security gateway, &quot;client&quot; will be used to
refer to the endpoint host that the user is sitting in front of and
&quot;server&quot; will be used to refer to the central network security
gateway.
<P>Important note: If your VPN is based on the AH protocol (including AH+ESP), it
cannot be masqueraded. The AH protocol specifies a cryptographic checksum
across portions of the IP header, including the IP addresses. IP Masquerade is
implemented by modifying the source IP address for outbound packets and the
destination IP address for inbound packets. Since the masquerading gateway
cannot participate in the encryption key exchange, it cannot generate the
correct cryptographic checksums for the modified IP headers. Thus the
modified IP packets will be discarded by the recipient as invalid, because
they fail the cryptographic checksum test.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 What is PPTP?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>
<A HREF="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?PPTP">PPTP</A></B>
stands for <EM><B>P</B></EM>oint-to-<EM><B>P</B></EM>oint
<EM><B>T</B></EM>unnelling <EM><B>P</B></EM>rotocol. It is a
Microsoft-proposed protocol for implementing a VPN.
<P>The PPTP VPN protocol consists of two communications channels between the
client and server: a control channel over which link-management information
is passed, and a data channel over which (possibly encrypted) private network
traffic is carried.
<P>The control channel is a standard TCP connection to port 1723 on the
server. The data channel carrying the private network traffic uses IP
protocol number 47 (GRE), a generic encapsulation protocol described in
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1701.html">RFC1701</A>. The transparent transmission of data over the data channel
is achieved by negotiating a standard PPP connection over it, just as if it
were a dialup connection directly from the client to the server. The
options negotiated over the tunnel by PPP control whether the data is
compressed and/or encrypted, thus PPTP itself has nothing to do with
encryption.
<P>The details of the PPTP protocol are documented in
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2637.html">RFC2637</A>.
<P>Microsoft's implementation of the PPTP protocol is not considered very
secure. If you're interested in the details, here are three separate analyses:

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 What is FWZ?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>FWZ</B> is a proprietary encryption protocol developed by 
<A HREF="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</A>.
It is used in VPNs that are built around their Firewall-1 product.
<P>A Checkpoint-based firewall can be configured in several modes. The
&quot;FWZ Encapsulation&quot; mode <EM>cannot</EM> be masqueraded. The
&quot;IKE&quot; mode, which uses standard IPsec protocols, can be
masqueraded with minor configuration changes on the VPN gateway.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Why masquerade a VPN client?</A>
</H2>

<P>Most current VPN clients assume you will be connecting the client computer
directly to the internet. Doing this when you have only a single connection
for internet access bypasses your Linux firewall and the security and
access-sharing capabilities that it provides. Extending the Linux firewall
to also masquerade VPN traffic allows you to retain the firewalling
security provided by the Linux firewall as well as permitting the other
systems on your local network to access the internet regardless of whether
or not the VPN network connection is active.
<P>If your firewall is being used in a corporate setting you may also wish to
require your VPN client users to go through that firewall for security
reasons, rather than providing them with modems so they can dial out on
their own when they need to use VPN. VPN Masquerade allows you to do so
even if the desktops do not have registered IP addresses.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Can several clients on my local network use IPsec simultaneously?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes, though there may occasionally be minor problems.
<P>The IPsec protocols define a method for identifying the traffic streams
called the <EM>Security Parameters Index</EM> (&quot;SPI&quot;).
Unfortunately the SPI used by outbound traffic is different from the SPI
used by inbound traffic, and there is no other identifying information
available that is not encrypted, so association of the inbound and outbound
data streams is difficult and not perfectly reliable.
<P>IPsec Masquerade attempts to associate inbound and outbound ESP traffic by
serializing new connections. While this has worked well in testing, it
cannot be guaranteed to be perfectly reliable, and the serialization of new
traffic may result in some timeouts if the link is saturated or if many
local IPsec hosts attempt to initiate communications or rekey with the same
remote IPsec host simultaneously. 
<P>It is also assumed that should this association scheme fail to associate
the traffic streams correctly, the IPsec hosts themselves will discard the
incorrectly routed traffic because it will have the wrong SPI values. This
is required by the IPsec RFCs.
<P>These problems could be eliminated if there was some way to sniff the new
SPI values from the ISAKMP key exchange before any ESP traffic appears, but
unfortunately that portion of the key exchange is encrypted.
<P>To minimize the problems associated with this, it is recommended that you
open a command window on your masqueraded IPsec host and run the
&quot;ping&quot; program pinging a host on the remote network for as long
as you have the tunnel up.
<P>See the IPsec technical notes at the end of the document for more details.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="multiclientpptp"></A> <H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Can several clients on my local network use PPTP simultaneously?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes.
<P>You must enable PPTP Call ID masquerade when configuring your kernel in
order to distinguish between multiple data streams from the same server.
PPTP masq with Call ID masq enabled will support many concurrent masqueraded
sessions with no restrictions on which server a client can call.
<P>
<A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2637.html">The PPTP RFC</A>
specifies in section 3.1.3 that there may only be one control channel
connection between two systems. This <EM>should</EM> mean that you can only
masquerade one PPTP session at a time with a given remote server, but in
practice the MS implementation of PPTP does not enforce this, at least not as
of NT 4.0 Service Pack 4. If the PPTP server you're trying to connect to only
permits one connection at a time, it's following the protocol rules properly.
Note that this does not affect a masqueraded server, only multiple masqueraded
clients attempting to contact the same remote server.
<P>For another alternative, see the next question...
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 Can I access the remote network from my entire local network?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes. However, your VPN client must be able to forward IP traffic.
<P>This means that you'll either have to use a Linux VPN client or a MS NT VPN
client. The IP stack in W'95 and W'98 does not support IP forwarding. NT
Workstation will work for this, and is less expensive than NT Server if
you're only using it to route encrypted traffic.
<P>If you cannot install a Linux or NT-based VPN client, then you'll have to
enable PPTP Call-ID masquerade if you are using PPTP, and install VPN
client software on every system you want to provide access for. This is
inefficient, aesthetically revolting, a security weakness, and may not work
if the PPTP server correctly implements the protocol, but it's cheaper
than licensing NT.
<P>Network-to-network routing this way works very well. This is how I have my
home network set up for telecommuting. It does require a little more
networking knowhow than simply giving everybody their own VPN client.
<P>In my experience, network-to-network routing in a pure-MS environment
requires RRAS be installed at both ends of the tunnel.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.9">2.9 Why masquerade the VPN server?</A>
</H2>

<P>If your VPN server has a registered IP address you do not need to
masquerade it, simply configure your firewall to route the VPN traffic
properly as described below.
<P>If your VPN server has a Private-Network IP address you will need to
redirect the inbound traffic to it and masquerade the outbound traffic from
it. Masquerading allows you to make a VPN server available to the internet
even if you only have one assigned IP address. This should work even if
your IP address is dynamically assigned: you would publicize the IP address
for clients through the use of a third-party dynamic DNS service such as
that provided by 
<A HREF="http://www.ddns.org/">DDNS.ORG</A>
or 
<A HREF="http://www.cjb.net/">CJB.NET</A>
and configure the clients to connect to a system named
<CODE>our-company.ddns.org</CODE> or something similar. Note that this is a
security risk, because it is possible for an incorrect IP address to be
retrieved from the dynamic DNS server through timing problems, a failure to
properly register the current dynamic IP address, or a third party
registering a different IP address under the system name.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.10">2.10 Why patch the Linux kernel?</A>
</H2>

<P>The largest problem in masquerading VPN traffic is that the stock 
Linux IP masquerade has no special awareness of IP protocols other than
TCP, UDP and ICMP.
<P>All IP traffic may be forwarded and filtered by IP address, but
masquerading IP protocols other than TCP, UDP and ICMP requires modifying the
kernel.
<P>The PPTP control channel is plain TCP and requires no special setup beyond
letting it through the firewall and masquerading it.
<P>Masquerading the IPsec and PPTP data channels requires a modification that
adds support for the ESP and GRE protocols to the masquerading code, and
masquerading the ISAKMP key exchange protocol requires a modification that
prevents masquerade from altering the UDP source port number and adds
tracking of the ISAKMP cookie values instead of the port number.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.11">2.11 Current Status</A>
</H2>

<P>The 2.0.x kernel patch works on kernel 2.0.36 and is incorporated into the
standard 2.0.37 and higher kernel releases. It may work on earlier kernels but
I have not tested it, and I recommend you upgrade to kernel 2.0.38 anyway
for security reasons if you are running an older kernel.
<P>The 2.2.x kernel patch works on kernels from 2.2.5 to 2.2.17 and may work
on earlier kernels, but that has not been tested. It has been submitted for
inclusion in the standard 2.2.18 release.
<P>I don't have the resources to follow the development kernels, so at this
time no work on VPN Masquerade for 2.3.x or 2.4.x has taken place. If you
know someone who <EM>is</EM> working on this, please let me know.
<P>The 2.0.x kernel patch has been tested and works on x86 and Sparc systems,
and the 2.2.x kernel patch has been tested and works on x86 and PowerPC systems,
but there should be no major problems in porting to other architectures. I
believe the architecture dependencies would only be in endian-ness within the
bitmaps in the GRE header definition used to format debugging log messages.
If anyone ports this to a non-Intel architecture I'd appreciate hearing
about it so I can merge any changes into the master copy.
<P>A PPTP-only kernel patch for the 2.1.105+ and early 2.2.x kernels is
available at
