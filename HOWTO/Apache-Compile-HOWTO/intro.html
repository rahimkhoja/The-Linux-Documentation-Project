>1.2. Why I wrote this document</H2
><P
>	All Linux distributions I tested had a non-optimal default setup of Apache. Additionally all major 
	distributions don't have current versions of Apache.
	</P
><P
>	Finally most commercial <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>Unix</SPAN
> are delivered without pre-installed Apache, or using a very strange setup. 
	</P
><P
>	Since I am installing a lot of customized webservers on different Unixes therefor I wrote a 
	plaintext document and placed it on my website so I can access it at work. Later a friend 
	posted the URL to a mailinglist, and the first questions arrived. So I decided to put more information 
	on the page.
	</P
><P
>	After a lot of people requested the document as an »official« HOWTO written in <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SGML</SPAN
>, 
	I decided to prepare it to be one.

>1.3. What this document is supposed to be</H2
><P
>	Compiling all the items described below needs a lot of configure-options that 
	nobody can memorize. This is supposed to be a copy-paste-ready text to compile 
	Apache and friends.
	</P
><P
>	Also, people should learn how to build a full-featured 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Apache</SPAN
> webserver by themself to be independent from any <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Linux</SPAN
> distributors.

	All other programs and modules mentioned in the HOWTO are working perfectly
