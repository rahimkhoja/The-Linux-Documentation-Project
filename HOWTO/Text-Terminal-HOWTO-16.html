<H2><A NAME="ss16.1">16.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc16.1">Intro to Terminfo</A>
</H2>

<P> Terminfo (formerly Termcap) is a database of terminal capabilities
and more.  For every (well almost) model of terminal it tells
application programs what the terminal is capable of doing.  It tells
what escape sequences (or control characters) to send to the terminal
in order to do things such as move the cursor to a new location, erase
part of the screen, scroll the screen, change modes, change appearance
(colors, brightness, blinking, underlining, reverse video etc.).
After about 1980, many terminals supported over a hundred different
commands (some of which take numeric parameters).</P>
<P>One way in which terminfo gives the its information to an application
program is via the "ncurses" functions that a programmer may put into
a C program.  For example, if a program wants to move the cursor to row
3, col 6 it simply calls: move(3,6).  The move() function (part of
ncurses) knows how to do this for your terminal (it has read
terminfo).  So it sends the appropriate escape sequence to the
terminal to make this particular move for a certain terminal.
Some programs get info directly from a terminfo files without using
ncurses.  Thus a Linux package that doesn't require ncurses may still
need a terminfo file for your terminal.</P>
<P>The terminfo abbreviations are usually longer than those of termcap
and thus it's easier to guess what they mean.  The manual pages for
terminfo are more detailed (and include the old termcap
abbreviations).  Also, the termcap entries had a size limitation which
is not present for terminfo.  Thus, unless you are already committed
to working with termcap, it's suggested you use terminfo.</P>

<H2><A NAME="database"></A> <A NAME="ss16.2">16.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc16.2">Terminfo Database </A>
</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P> The terminfo database is compiled and thus has a source part and a
compiled part.  The old termcap database has only a source part but
this source can, by a single command, be both converted to terminfo
source and then compiled.  Thus you may get by without having any
terminfo source since the termcap source can create the compiled
terminfo database.  To see a display of the database for the terminal
you're now using (including a PC monitor) type "infocmp" and you
should see the source terminfo "file" for it.</P>
<P>To see if your terminal (say vt100) is in the terminfo data base type
"locate vt100".  If you need to find the terminfo name for your
terminal, explore the listing of files in the compiled database or see
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#term_name">What is the terminfo name of my terminal ?</A></P>

<H3>Where is the database located ?</H3>

<H3><A NAME="tc_compiled_locs"></A> Compiled database locations </H3>

<P> Typing "locate vt100" may show /usr/lib/terminfo/v/vt100,
/usr/share/terminfo/v/vt100, /home/.../.terminfo/v/vt100, and/or
/etc/terminfo/v/vt100.  All these are possible locations of the
compiled terminfo files.  Although the /etc/terminfo directory is not
a standard location for it, having a few terminal types there could be
useful in case the /usr directory is not accessible.  For example /usr
could be on a separate disk or partition that failed to mount.
Normally, programs that use your main terminfo data base are able to
find it if it's in at least one of the locations mentioned above.
Otherwise the environment variable TERMINFO may be set to the path to
this database.  Example: TERMINFO=/usr/share/terminfo</P>
<P>For the Debian Distribution of Linux, several commonly used terminals
(including the monitor-console) are in the ncurses-term package.
These are put into /etc/terminfo/.  All of the terminals in the
database are in the ncurses-bin package and go into
/usr/share/terminfo/.</P>
<P>If the compiled terminfo is in more than one location, everything is
usually OK until someone installs new terminfo files (from a newer
distribution, from the net, by editing the old one, etc.).  Each new
terminfo file should replace all the existing older copies of that file
(at various locations) unless you abolish redundant locations.  If you
don't ensure this gets done, then some application programs could wind
up still finding and using the old (and possibly buggy) terminfo data
that sill exists in a "possible" location.  Setting the environment
variable TERMINFO to the up-to-date location (as mentioned above)
would help avoid this problem.</P>

<H3><A NAME="tc_source_loc"></A> Source-code database locations </H3>

<P> While the source-code file may  not be installed on your computer
there's another way to get the source-code if you have the compiled
code.  Just use the "<CODE>infocmp</CODE>" command.</P>
<P>The source code file (for all terminals) may be /etc/termcap and/or
terminfo.src (or another name).  See the man pages: terminfo(5) or
termcap(5) for the format required to create (or modify) these source
files.  The file terminfo.src may be in various locations on your
computer or it may not be included with your Linux distribution.  Use
the <CODE>locate</CODE> command to try to find it.  It is available on the web
at 
<A HREF="http://catb.org/terminfo/">http://catb.org/terminfo/</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="tic"></A> Terminfo Compiler (tic) </H3>

<P> The data in the source files is compiled with the "tic" program
which is capable of converting between termcap format and terminfo
format.  Thus you can create a compiled terminfo data base from
termcap source.  The installation program which was used to install
Linux probably installed the compiled files on your hard disk so you
don't need to compile anything unless you modify /etc/termcap (or
terminfo.src ).  "tic" will automatically install the resulting
compiled files into a terminfo directory ready to be used by
application programs.  Which location it's installed in depends on ...
See "man tic" for the explanation.</P>

<H3><A NAME="infocmp"></A> Look at Your Terminfo </H3>

<P> It's a good idea to take a look at the terminfo entry for the
terminal you are using (source code of course) and read the comments.
A quick way to inspect it without comments is to just type "infocmp".
But the comments may tell you something special about the terminal
such as how you need to set it up so that it will work correctly with
the terminfo database.</P>

<H3>Deleting Data Not Needed</H3>

<P> In order to save disk space, one may delete all of the terminfo
database except for the terminals types that you have (or might need
in the future).  Don't delete any of the termcaps for a "Linux
terminal" (the console) or the ones used for x-terminal-emulation
such as xterm.  The terminal type "dumb" may be needed when an
application program can't figure out what type of terminal you are
using.  It would save disk space if install programs only installed
the terminfo for the terminals that you have and if you could get a
termcap for a newly installed terminal over the Internet in a few
seconds.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss16.3">16.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc16.3">Bugs in Existing Terminfo Files (and Hardware)</A>
</H2>

<P> Unfortunately, there are a number of bugs in the terminfo and
termcap files.  In addition, many of these terminfo files are
incomplete and do not define certain features available on the
terminals.  Sometimes you can get by without modifying the terminfo
but in other cases you need to modify it or possibly use another
emulation that has a good terminfo.</P>
<P>The sad state of the supplied terminfo files is due to a number of
reasons.  One is that during the 1980's when many of them were written
(often in termcap format), application programs did not utilize more
advanced terminal features.  Thus if such feature were not in the
termcap (or terminfo) file, no one complained.  Also, writing termcaps
was often done by volunteers who were in short supply.  Today,
programs such as vim use "context highlighting" and minicom uses the
terminal's graphics character set.  These often need more definitions
to be added to the old termcap.  This may (or may not) have already
been done.</P>
<P>Most terminals had hardware bugs (in their firmware) and sometimes
these were "fixed" by modifying the termcap.  Then the manufacturer
might send out replacement chips which would fix the bug.  Not all
owners would bother to get the replacement chips.  Thus there may be 2
or more terminfos for your terminal, depending on what firmware chips
it has in it.  This situation was often not noted in the termcap and
only one of these termcaps may be supplied with Linux.  Some hardware
bugs which existed for features that were almost never used in the
past likely never did get fixed.  Also, some reported hardware bugs
may never have been fixed since they were not of much significance at
the time or because the terminal manufacturing company went out of
business, etc.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss16.4">16.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc16.4">Modifying Terminfo Files</A>
</H2>

<P> To do this you need a manual for your terminal showing what escape
sequences it uses.  Newer manuals from the 1990's often don't show
this.  You also need a terminfo manual (the man page "terminfo" is
one).  After you edit the terminfo source file you compile it using
"tic".  "tic" should automatically put the compiled terminfo file in
the correct directory reserved for it.</P>
<P>If you would like to find a better terminfo entry for a certain terminal
than the one supplied, you might try searching the Internet (but what
you find could be worse).  If your new terminfo entry is better than
the old one and it seems stable (you've used it for a while with no
problems) then you should send a copy to the maintainer of terminfo as
noted at the start of the source file for terminfo (or termcap).</P>

<H2><A NAME="init_string"></A> <A NAME="ss16.5">16.5</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc16.5">Init String </A>
</H2>

<P> Included in the terminfo are often a couple of initialization
strings which may be sent to the terminal to initialize it.  This may
change the appearance of the screen, change what mode the terminal is
in, and/or make the terminal emulate another terminal.  No
initialization string is automatically sent to the terminal to
initialize it.  One might expect that the getty program should do
this.  If it did, one could make a change to the set-up stored inside
the terminal but this change wouldn't happen because the init string
would override it.  Application programs don't seem to initialize
(send an init string per terminfo) either.</P>
<P>To actually send an init string you must use a command given on the
command line (or in a shell script such as /etc/profile).  Such
commands are: "reset" "tset", "tput init", or "setterm -initialize".
Sometimes there is no need to send an init string since the terminal
may set itself up correctly when it is powered on (using
options/preferences one has set up and saved in the non-volatile
memory of the terminal).</P>

<H2><A NAME="term_var"></A> <A NAME="ss16.6">16.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc16.6">TERM Variable </A>
</H2>

<P> The Environment variable TERM should be set to the name of
terminal which you are using.  If TERM hasn't been set yet and you
don't know the name of your terminal see 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#term_name">What is the terminfo name of my terminal ?</A>.  It is normally
set by the terminal_type parameter passed to the getty program (look
at it in the /etc/inittab file).  This name must be in the Terminfo
data base.  Just type "set" at the command line to see what TERM is
set to (or type: tset -q).  At a console (monitor) TERM is set to
"linux" which is the PC monitor emulating a fictitious terminal model
named "linux".  Since "linux" is close to a vt100 terminal and many
text terminals are also, the "linux" designation will sometimes work
as a temporary expedient with a text terminal.</P>
<P>If more than one type of terminal may be connected to the same port
(/dev/ttyS...) (for example, if there is a switch to permit different
terminal types to use the same serial port, or if the port is
connected to a modem to which people call in from different types of
terminals) then TERM needs to be set each time someone connects to the
serial port.  There is often a query escape sequence so that the
computer may ask the terminal what type it is.  Another way is to ask
the user to type in (or select) the type of terminal s/he is using.
You may need to use tset for this or write a short shell script to
handle this.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="reset_"></A> 
One way to do this is to use "reset" (same as "tset"; see the manual
page).  reset tries to determine the terminal name of the terminal you
are using.  Then it looks up the data in terminfo and sends your
terminal an init string.  It can also set the value of TERM.  For
example, a user dials in and logs in.  The .profile login script is
executed which contains within it the following statement: eval `tset
-s ?vt100`.  This results in: The user is asked if s/he is using a
vt100.  The user either responds yes or types in the actual terminal
type s/he is using.  Then "reset" sends the init string and sets TERM
to this terminal name (type).</P>
