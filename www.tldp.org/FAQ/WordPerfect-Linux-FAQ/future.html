>8.1. Why did Corel cease publishing WP for Linux?</H2
><P
>Corel discontinued all Linux-related operations shortly after Microsoft Corporation's major investment that prevented the firm's collapse:  Some speculate a causal relationship.  Corel may have also seen WP for Linux sales (and downloads) as being at the expense of its versions for non-Linux Unixes, through both the influx of Intel Linux boxes and other Unix platforms' increasing ability to run Intel Linux binaries.  Also, outgoing CEO Michael Cowpland had been the main force behind Corel's Linux program, and new management doesn't share his views.</P

>8.3. Won't WP for Linux re-emerge as part of Xandros Desktop?</H2
><P
>It appears not.  When Corel divested itself of CLOS, and transferred all rights to Xandros Corporation, WordPerfect was not part of the deal.  Corel is sitting on all WP rights.</P

NAME="OPENSOURCE"

>8.4. If Corel doesn't want to sell WP for Linux, why doesn't it open-source the program?</H2
><P
>First, that would impair sales of Corel's versions for Win32 and other proprietary platforms.  Second, Corel doesn't own all the necessary rights.  WP includes code from at least five other companies, judging by the copyright notices (Blueberry Software, Globetrotter Software, Inc., Bristol Technology, Inc., INSO Corporation, and Novell, Inc.).</P
><P
>In the latter sense, Corel's situation is similar to that of Sun Microsystems in regard to Star Office.  Sun bought the publisher of that program, Star Division GmbH, and then spent approximately a year and untold employee time studying copyright, patent, contract, and other encumbrances.  Eventually, it was able to open-source the majority of the source code, the part not encumbered by third-party rights, as what became the OpenOffice.org project.</P
><P
>The difference is that Sun was strongly motivated to create an open-source variant for all possible OS platforms -- in order to feed sales of Solaris and its hardware, and to undermine Microsoft Corporation.  It had (and has) deep resources and patience.  Corel had none of those things -- and might have had greater third-party interests to contend with.</P

></LI
></UL
><P
>The last item listed, LyX, is an intriguing hybrid of GUI word processor features and classic Unix-type document processing.  The latter is often dismissed in the business world as powerful and professional but too arcane -- but LyX makes it accessible.</P
><P
>The rationale and work-flow approach behind LyX are best described on that project's Web site at <A
HREF="http://www.lyx.org/about/intro.php3"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.lyx.org/about/intro.php3</A
>, but here's an attempt to summarise:</P
><P
>LyX has you work on a document in a graphical, close approximation of how it will print, but, unlike in traditional word processors, you don't directly manipulate document appearance, but rather apply (and edit / create) style rulesets (templates), which consistently apply formatting on your behalf -- and change consistently wherever used in the document, when you alter a style's contents.  (Rulesets are applied by the LaTeX front-end macro package driving the professional-grade teTeX typesetting engine, for all of which LyX is a graphical shell.  teTeX is an open-source implementation of Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting system.)</P
><P
>As a result, eventual output is always consistent and of true professional appearance (famously so), regardless of the document's complexity.  LyX becomes progressively easier to use than ostensibly simpler word processors as you get into more-complex documents (technical documentation, doctoral theses, conference proceedings, movie scripts, articles on mathematics or physics with formulas to edit and present).  Many templates for both simple and complex document types are provided, all traditional word-processing features are also present, and so is extremely thorough on-line help.</P
><P
>As a bonus, all documents are stored in plain ASCII text with embedded TeX style tags, resulting in accessible data that will never auto-corrupt the way many word-processor formats do, that lends itself nicely to version control, and that outputs to practically any data format desired.</P
><P
>Consider transitioning to LyX or some other form of structured-document editing instead of traditional word processing, over the long term.  Your benefits over the long haul will justify the trouble.</P
