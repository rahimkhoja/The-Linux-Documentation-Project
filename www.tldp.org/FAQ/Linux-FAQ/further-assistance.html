everything you read there will apply to Linux. The FAQ's, like all

you these files, if you don't have FTP access). There are mirrors of 
<TT

Introduction to *.answers posting, or look in 
<TT

</P
><P
>Check the relevant HOWTO for the subject in question, if there is one,
or an appropriate old style sub-FAQ document. Check the FTP sites. 
</P
><P
>Try experimenting - that's the best way to get to know Unix and Linux.
</P
><P
>Read the documentation. Check the manual pages (type <TT
CLASS="literal"
>man man</TT
> if
you don't know about manual pages. Also try 
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>man -k subject</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>apropos subject</TT

often list useful and relevant, but not very obvious, manual pages. 
</P

>Check the Info documentation (type
<B

>-<B
CLASS="keycap"
>i</B

i.e. the <B
CLASS="keycap"
>F1</B

in Emacs). This isn't just for Emacs. For example, the GCC 
documentation lives here as well. 
</P

installation and/or usage instructions. 
</P
><P
>Make sure you don't have a corrupted or out-of-date copy of the
program in question. If possible, download it again and re-install 
ityou probably made a mistake the first time.

posting or E-mail. Making a complete posting will greatly increase the

information and motivation to reply.

E-mail sent to experts and fellow users.

>You are in little danger of making your posting too long unless you
include large chunks of source code or uuencoded files, so err on the 
side of giving too much information. 
</P
><P
>Use a clear, detailed Subject line. Don't put things like "doesn't
work", "Linux", "help", or "question" in it &#8212; we already know that. 
Save the space for the name of the program, a fragment of an error 
message, or summary of the unusual behavior. 
</P
><P
>Put a summary paragraph at the top of your posting.
</P
><P
>At the bottom of your posting, ask for responses by email and say
you'll post a summary. Back this up by using 
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>Followup-To: poster</TT
>. 
Then, actually post the summary in a few days or a week or so. Don't 
just concatenate the replies you received, summarize them. Putting the word 
"SUMMARY" in your summary's Subject line is also a good idea. Consider 
submitting the summary to <A

><I
CLASS="citetitle"

>. 
</P
><P
>Make sure your posting doesn't have an inappropriate References:
header line. This marks your article as part of the thread of the 
article referred to, which will often cause it to be junked by 
readers, along with the rest of a boring thread. 
</P
><P
>You might like to say in your posting that you've read this FAQ and
the appropriate HOWTO'sthis may make people less likely to skip your 
posting.

the sender's permission.

posting asking for help.

community are very helpful and responsive to E-mailed questions, 
you're likely asking for help from unpaid volunteers, so you have no 
right to expect an answer.
