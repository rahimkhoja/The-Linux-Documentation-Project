>When you have all of this information, make sure that the programs <B
CLASS="command"
>pppd</B

<B
CLASS="command"
>chat</B

most current distributions, they are installed in the 
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/sbin/</TT
> directory, and you will need to be logged in 
as root to use them. In addition, the following programs are also useful for 
configuring network connections, determining network status, and diagnosing 
problems: <TT

CLASS="filename"
>/sbin/route</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin/ping</TT

root.

Internet); use <TT

>These are the most basic steps for configuring a PPP connection. You will also need
to take into account what other network connections may be present (for 
example, if there's an Ethernet connection that has already been assigned the 
default route), as well as various security measures at your ISP's end. If 
you're having trouble making the dial-up connection, usually the best way to 
determine what may be going wrong is to use Seyon, minicomm, kermit, or some 
other program to dial and log in manually to the ISP, and determine just 
exactly what you have to do to log in, then duplicate that in the PPP 
scripts.

>Most version 2.2.x kernels need a set of patches
to install the <B
CLASS="command"

communicate efficiently (if at all) with Sparc, IBM RS, and Alpha machines, 
and probably others. This package is actually a collection of patches to the 
kernel sources. Better support for non-Intel architectures is included in the 
2.4 kernels.

it is easier to install. It may be equally efficient.

>In the case of older Solaris releases, the
lack of <TT
