>The name "Linux" is used to refer to three similar yet slightly different things,
which can be confusing to all but the hardcore geek. 
The three usages vary by how much of a complete software system the speaker is talking about. 
</P
><P
>At the lowest level, every Linux system is based on the <EM
>Linux kernel</EM
>
&#8212; the very low-level software that manages your computer hardware, 
multi-tasks the many programs that are running at any given time, and other 
such essential things. 
These low-level functions are used by other programs, so their authors can 
focus on the specific functionality they want to provide. 
Without the kernel, your computer is a very expensive doorstop. 
It has all of the features of a modern operating system: true multitasking, 
threads, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared, copy-on-write 
executables, proper memory management, 
loadable device driver modules, video frame buffering, and TCP/IP networking. 
</P
><P
>Most often, the name "Linux" is used to refer to the <EM
>Linux Operating System</EM
>.
An OS includes the kernel, but also adds various utilities &#8212; the kinds of programs 
you need to get anything done. 
For example, it includes a <EM
>shell</EM
> (the program that provides a command prompt and lets you run programs), 
a program to copy files, a program to delete files, and many other odds and ends. 
Some people honor the request of Richard Stallman and the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org"
TARGET="_top"
><I
CLASS="citetitle"
>GNU Project</I
></A
>, 
and call the Linux OS <EM
>GNU/Linux</EM
>, because a good number of these utility programs were written by the GNU folks. 
</P
><P
>Finally, software companies (and sometimes volunteer groups) add on lots of extra software, like the
<A
HREF="http://www.xfree86.org"
TARGET="_top"
><I
CLASS="citetitle"
>XFree86 X Window System</I
></A
>, <A

></A
>, 
<A
HREF="http://www.kde.org"
TARGET="_top"
><I
CLASS="citetitle"
>KDE</I
></A
>, games and many other applications. 
These software compilations which are based on the Linux OS are called <EM
>Linux distributions</EM
>. 
</P
><P
>So, there are three Linuxes: the Linux kernel, the Linux OS, and the various Linux distributions.
Most people, however, refer to the operating system kernel, system software, 
and application software, collectively, as "Linux", and that convention is 
used in this FAQ as well.

>A: </B
>Officially an operating system is not allowed to be called a Unix until it
passes the Open Group's certification tests, and supports the necessary API's. 
Nobody has yet stepped forward to pay the large fees that certification 
involves, so we're not allowed to call it Unix. 
Certification really doesn't mean very much anyway. 
Very few of the commercial operating systems have passed the Open Group tests.

>A: </B
>Unofficially, Linux is very similar to the operating systems which are known
as Unix, and for many purposes they are equivalent. 
Linux the kernel is an operating system kernel that behaves and performs similarly 
to the famous Unix operating system from AT&#38;T Bell Labs. 
Linux is often called a "Unix-like" operating system.

Linus uses to say, "hello".

>For the benefit of those who
don't have the equipment or inclination: Linus pronounces Linux approximately 
as <EM

and the <EM

>Linux is freely available, and no one is required to
register with any central authority, so it is difficult to know. 
Several businesses survive solely on selling and supporting Linux. 
Linux newsgroups are some of the most heavily read on Usenet. 
Accurate numbers are hard to come by, but the number is almost certainly in the millions. 
</P
><P
>However, people can register as Linux users at the Linux Counter project,
which has been in existence since 1993. In May of 2003 the project counted 
more than 134,000 users, but that is certainly only a small fraction of all users. 
The operator of the Linux Counter estimated 18 million users, as of May 2003.
