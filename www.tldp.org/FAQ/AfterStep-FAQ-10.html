<P>Please, please, don't post questions unrelated to AfterStep to the mailing
lists. If you have a problem with some application not running, and you think
AfterStep is the culprit, first try the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Read the documentation (man pages, etc.) for the program.</LI>
<LI> Find out about its configuration parameters (not only command line, but
also options in  .Xdefaults, config files, etc.).</LI>
<LI> Ask other people who know about that specific program. Find a mailing
list about that program and ask there.</LI>
<LI> Try running the program under some other window manager. If it doesn't
work there either, it is not an AfterStep problem.</LI>
</OL>
<P>If you are very confident that it is an AfterStep problem, then send it to
the mailing list, but try to give as much information as possible. Questions
like `Why doesn't blig-graphics work on my system?' do not contain any
useful information that may help others in diagnosing your problem; you run
the risk of getting a nasty answer if you send such a message to the list.
Some data you may have to include is:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> AfterStep version you are using.</LI>
<LI> Operating system version, machine architecture.</LI>
<LI> System configuration (color depth, memory, anything you think may help).</LI>
<LI> Problematic program.</LI>
<LI> Environment information (other programs running at the same time, etc.)</LI>
<LI> A detailed description of the problem. What happens (error messages,
etc.), how replicable it is, how to replicate it, etc.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The more information you provide, the easier it will be for others to find a
solution.
<P>A good reason to suppose that the problem lies in AfterStep is to  test the
same program with an AS-compatible window manager.  This means that a
failure of a program which works perfectly on Enlightenment is not a failure
in AS terms; but a failure of an fvwm-1 program is something of concern for
AfterSteppers.
