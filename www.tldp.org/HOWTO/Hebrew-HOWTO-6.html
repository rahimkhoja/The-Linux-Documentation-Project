</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hebrew package by Joseph Friedman. It includes some Hebrew fonts in BDF

<A HREF="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.tar.Z">ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.tar.Z</A>.</LI>
<LI>A very simple Hebrew package. Includes only right-to-left cursor movement
support and right-to-left sorting. Works without any patches with FSF emacs 
19. Can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.el.Z">ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/Hebrew.el.Z</A>.</LI>
<LI>One of emacs branches - MULE (Multi Lingual Emacs) Supports a lot of 
languages including Hebrew. It compiles and runs under Linux with no problem. 
It is full Emacs, with Hebrew support and double-direction handling. It can be 
obtained from:

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Dosemu</A>
</H2>

<P>For a VC dosemu you can use your Hebrew from the Video card EPROM, and if 
you don't have it there are plenty of Hebrew dos fonts from EGA support to 
the VGA Hebrew support.
<P>For X-Windows support you should download the file:
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/fonts/hebxfonts-0.1.tgz</A>
it's contain some fonts include one called vgah.pcf that you should install 
it on your fonts directory as describe 
<A HREF="Hebrew-HOWTO-4.html#install-fonts">above</A>
the fonts are:
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 XHTerm</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a main port of the regular X-Term program for use with a Hebrew 
fonts - XHTerm =  xterm +  Hebrew support. The port for a sun machine was 
made avalible by the help of Danny 
<A HREF="mailto:danny@cs.huji.ac.il">&lt;tt>danny@cs.huji.ac.il&lt;/tt></A>. Evgeny has some patch for use this port 
under Linux. His version should come with a pre-compiled XHTerm for both 
X11R5 and X11R6. You should use xhterm with the option <CODE>-fn</CODE> and a Hebrew 
font 
<A HREF="Hebrew-HOWTO-4.html#xterm-font">as described</A>!
Danny's port (for SUN) can be obtained from: 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.huji.ac.il/pub/local/xhterm">ftp://ftp.huji.ac.il/pub/local/xhterm</A>
and the patched version of Evgeny Stambulchik is on: 
<A HREF="ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/software/linux">ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/software/linux</A>
Get it from there and you'll get 5 
<A HREF="Hebrew-HOWTO-4.html#install-fonts">fonts with  it</A>: <CODE>[heb10x20.pcf, heb6x13.bdf, heb6x13.pcf, heb8x13.bdf, heb8x13.pcf]</CODE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 TeX--XeT - Hebrew Tex.</A>
</H2>

<P>The bigest problem with Tex with Hebrew is that the charecters should go 
backwards relative to Visual look (i.e. pico inserts the charecters from 
right to left), so the best thing is to get XHterm with a regular emacs and 
write the Hebrew left to right, backwards as well. 
<P>The newer NTeX distribution on sunsite (v1.5) includes everything, including
TeX--XeT, precompiled for Linux. It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.gz/pub/Linux/apps/tex/ntex">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu.gz/pub/Linux/apps/tex/ntex</A>. An older version of 
TeX--XeT can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex">ftp://noa.huji.ac.il/tex</A>. This
older version, however, has to be recompiled (not recommended).
<P>These TeX distributions are fine if you use LaTeX2.09. If you want to use
LaTeX2e (the current de facto standard) you have a problem.
Alon Ziv 
<A HREF="mailto:alonz@csa.cs.technion.ac.il">(alonz@csa.cs.technion.ac.il)</A> is currently working in support for
LaTeX2e with Hebrew, using the Babel languages system. I don't know the
current status of his work -- ask him!
