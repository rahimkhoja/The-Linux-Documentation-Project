<P>The Iomega ZIP drive is a popular, removable media disk drive.
It is avaliable in several versions.
<UL>
<LI> Parallel Port</LI>
<LI> SCSI</LI>
<LI> IDE - ATAPI</LI>
<LI> Plus </LI>
</UL>
  
The most popular seems to be the Parallel port version. It has been
around a long time and it is low cost. The SCSI version has also been 
around for a while but it needs a scsi card that many people do not have
already, so it it not quite as popular. The ATAPI version now seems
to be more available. The Plus is the newer version of the ZIP drive.
It has the capability to detect what port its plugged into, scsi or
parallel. This document will focus on the Parallel port version, but
also offer some tips for other versions.
