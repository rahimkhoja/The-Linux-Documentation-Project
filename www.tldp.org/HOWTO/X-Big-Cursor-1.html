<P>There are several reasons why the standard X mouse cursors are hard to
track for some people: 
<UL>
<LI> when running X on a notebook with low contrast LCD</LI>
<LI> on normal screens when using high resolution, 1600x1280 e.&nbsp;g.</LI>
<LI> for visually impaired persons even on normal hardware</LI>
</UL>
<P>In all cases it might help to use enlarged mouse cursors. Ideally this
job should be done by a single X program that automatically enlarges
every mouse cursor.
<P>To my knowledge there is no simple way to write a utility like this,
because the X protocol has no provision to query mouse cursors. For
more details see section 
<A HREF="X-Big-Cursor-5.html#tech">Technical discussion</A> below. 
<P>If we aim for a less general goal, though, something can be done: 
<P>There is a set of standard mouse cursors that can be found in the
cursor font (try <CODE>xfd -fn cursor</CODE> to look at it). Most programs use
these mouse cursors and the key idea is to replace the standard cursor
font with an enlarged version.
