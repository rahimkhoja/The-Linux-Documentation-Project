<P>In order for people in the outside world to locate your servers under
the domain name of your choice, whether for web, FTP, or email
delivery, you will have to register the domain name for insertion into
the relevant top level domain database. 
<P>
<P>Exercise some simple prudence in choosing your domain name. Certain
words or phrases may be forbidden on the grounds of community
standards, or may be offensive to visitors whose language or slang
differs from that of your region. Domain names can contain only the 26
letters of the Roman alphabet (without accents), the hyphen (though
not at the beginning or end of the name), and the 10 digits. Domain
names are not case-sensitive, and can be at least 26 characters long
(this limit is subject to change). Be careful not to register a name
which you can reasonably have been expected to know infringes on the
trademarks of an existing company, the courts are not kind to
cybersquatters. Some information on the circumstances under which your
poorly-chosen domain name might be stripped from your control are
available in this 
<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm">Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</A>.
<P>
<P>There are many companies which register names in the ``.com'',
``.net'', and ``.org'' top level domains. For a current list, check
the 
<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html">list of accredited registrars</A>.
<P>
<P>To register a name under a country top level domain, such as a
``.ca'', ``.de'', ``.uk'', etc., check with the appropriate authority,
which can be located in the 
<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/cctld.html">Country Code Top-Level Domains database</A>.
<P>
<P>Typically, you have to provide the registrar with contact information,
primary and secondary DNS IP numbers, a change request validation
scheme (you wouldn't want just anybody changing your domain for you),
and money in the form of an annual fee. If you're not comfortable with
the change request validation schemes offered by a registrar, let them
know that you're not willing to use the service until they address
your security concerns.
