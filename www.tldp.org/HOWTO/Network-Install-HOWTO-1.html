<!--

I was first prompted to write this document after reading a request for such a
document on the LDP suggestions page.  I realised that this was within my area
of expertise and approached the LDP about creating a new HOWTO document for the
project.  I took the LDP standard template and have modified that in order to
come up with the structure of this document.  Using both the template and a few
SGML references, I have written the SGML source, that I have since found to be
a particularly convenient type for converting into many different document
formats.
<P>About the author - I started working with Linux 2 years ago (at the time of
writing) when I joined IBM &reg;  in a Linux support role.  I started IBM with no
previous administration experience and learned my skills on the job.  A year
after I joined I was certified as a Redhat Expert (RHCE).  During my second
year I implemented a Linux network install server that I am still managing and
from which I hope to draw my knowledge to write this document.
