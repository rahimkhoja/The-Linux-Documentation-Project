>  The below sections are specific to camera models and/or groups of camera models. A particular camera model may be listed in more than one section as it may be supported by more than one method. One method may be easier than another and a specific method may meet your needs better. Select the method used carefully and read all the options before choosing one, it could save a lot of time later on.
 </P
><P
>  If a PC-Card reader is available, or a laptop computer with one built in, following the Compact Flash PC Card Adapter/PCMCIA-ATA Storage Card should be generic enough to work on almost all Kodak DC-Series Cameras and many non-Kodak digital cameras. Be aware that there are adapters for almost all memory devices used in digital cameras to another more common technology. Floppy Disk adapters for smart memory cards may work for cameras that use smart memory cards. These methods also tend to offer fast data transfer rates and are the preferred method of many.
 </P
><P
>  Although something may not be mentioned as to working with a particular piece of software don't assume that means the camera does not work with the software package. Often a camera works with the protocols other digital cameras use and past methods will work. If one finds a method works that is not mentioned in the HOWTO don't neglect to send in the information to this documents author, <A

>    If the previous message was not displayed, try relocating the camera closer or further away from the IrDA port and ensure that there is not too much external interference in the environment in the form of light. Also if the machine is a laptop with a PC-Card (or PCMCIA) modem removing it may help resolve the issue.

></H2
><P
>   This section is for those who wish to utilize maximum data transfer rate and save the battery power in the camera's batteries. The method of connectivity suggested in this section applies to all Kodak DC-Series cameras that use either PCMCIA-ATA storage cards or Compact Flash Cards. This method of picture access only allows for storage, retrieval, and deletion of images on a Compact Flash Card. These instructions are tested with a Kodak 16 MB Picture Card and a SanDisk CompactFlash PC Card Adapter on a Dell Inspiron 7000 notebook computer.

For example, if a system were to have 2 IDE controllers, and would thus have /dev/hda /dev/hdb /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd assigned to the current controllers, the Compact Flash Card PC Card Adapter would be assigned /dev/hde1.).

The manual pages which list the commands to use to do the above procedures can be accesses by typing the following to get the command's respective manual page entry: 'man cp', 'man mv', 'man rm'.
