<P>For the people whose Wearable is based on a PDA, there is little
choice : most of the time they have to do with the PDA's manufacturer
OS, AFAIK Linux on Psion series 5 is not mainstream.
a commercial solution called WindStone primary targeted to palmpilots
with a project to port it to ARM based computers it is made by
<A HREF="http://www.oski.co.kr/">OSK</A>, so
and see. For 
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~imp/pdamips.html"> Mips based PDA </A> type; some of them seem to be able to 
run 
<A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</A> ( it is a member of the *BSD family of
unices running on a lot of platforms ). 
<P>
<P>For those using a PC derivative, the choice seems to be between
Microsoft products or Linux, 
Well,  Microsoft products are not exactly the best choice and
DEBIAN/GNU Linux is the winner ( I don't think that for general
purposes one has to use a posix .4 compliant kernel ).
<P>There is another contender 
<A HREF="http://www.qnx.com">QNX</A>, but is more industrial oriented, so for
hobby or research it is not the best choice.
