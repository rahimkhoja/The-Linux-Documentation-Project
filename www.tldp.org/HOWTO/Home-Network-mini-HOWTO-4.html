<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Configuring Masquerading</A> </H2>

<P>All right! The preliminaries are over, this is where the magic begins.
IP masquerading is one of the truly magical services Linux provides. There
are commercial products for Windows which do the same thing, but not nearly
as efficiently: an ancient 386 can merrily provide IP masquerading services
to a whole medium sized office, but cannot even run Windows 95, let alone the
add on masquerading package. (As an addendum, I read in some recent reviews
that Windows 2000 will support "connection sharing" without addon software. It
looks like the companies which sold connection sharing software have been "embraced
and extended" by MicroSoft. However, I wouldn't recommend you try the Windows
2000 solution on a 386.)
<P>Linux has an extremely versatile firewalling capability, and we are going
to be using it in the simplest and crudest possible manner. If you want to
learn how to do firewalling like an expert, you should read both the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewalling HOWTO</A> for an
understanding of the theory and the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IPCHAINS-HOWTO.html">IPChains HOWTO</A> for instructions on the new <CODE>ipchains</CODE> firewalling
tool which ships with the Linux 2.2.X kernel (and by extension Red Hat 6.X).
There is also now a very good 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.html">IP Masquerading HOWTO</A> available which has more details on masquerading
tweaks.
<P>Configuring simple masquerading is very very easy once your internal and
external networking is operational. Edit the <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE> file and add
the following lines to the bottom:
<P>
<PRE>
# 1) Flush the rule tables. 
/sbin/ipchains -F input 
/sbin/ipchains -F forward 
/sbin/ipchains -F output 
# 2) Set the MASQ timings and allow packets in for DHCP configuration. 
/sbin/ipchains -M -S 7200 10 60 
/sbin/ipchains -A input -j ACCEPT -i eth0 -s 0/0 68 -d 0/0 67 -p udp 
# 3) Deny all forwarding packets except those from local network. 
#    Masquerage those. 
/sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY 
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQ 
# 4) Load forwarding modules for special services. 
/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp 
/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_raudio
 
</PRE>
<P>The last two lines insert kernel modules which allow FTP and RealAudio
to work for computers on the inside network. There are other modules for special
services which you can tack on if you need them:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>CUSeeMe (<CODE>/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_cuseeme</CODE>) </LI>
<LI>Internet Relay Chat (<CODE>/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_irc</CODE>) </LI>
<LI>Quake (<CODE>/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_quake</CODE>) </LI>
<LI>VDOLive (<CODE>/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_vdolive</CODE>) </LI>
</UL>
<P>Now you're ready to try masquerading! Run the <CODE>rc.local</CODE> script with the
command <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE> and you are ready to go! Sit down at one of your
other computers and try some web surfing. With any luck, everything is now
hunky dory.
