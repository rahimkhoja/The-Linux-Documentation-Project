</H2>

<P>This document is for people who want to install Oracle 8i
version 8.1.7 Enterprise edition on Linux RedHat 7.2. At the time Luca
Roversi tried to combine the twos, he could only find people on the net who was
wandering why previous HOWTOs could not lead them to a successful installation.
<P>We have not yet realized the points where this HOWTO substantially differs from
previous HOWTOs on the same subject; however, it lists operations that seems to 
be correct.
