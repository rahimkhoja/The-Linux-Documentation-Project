<LI>If you have trouble with your mouse in X or console mode, check you
are not running a getty on the serial line, or anything else such as a
modem for that matter. Also check for IRQ conflicts.</LI>
<LI>It is possible that you need to hold down the left button when 
booting X windows.  Some systems may send some sort of signal or spike to
the mouse when X starts.</LI>
<LI>Problems with serial devices may be due to the serial port not
being initialised correctly at boot. This is done by the
<CODE>setserial</CODE> command, run from the start-up script
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.serial.</CODE> Check the man page for
<CODE>setserial</CODE> and the Serial-HOWTO for more details.
It may be worth a little experimentation with types, for instance
try <CODE>setserial /dev/mouse uart 16550</CODE> or <CODE>16550a</CODE>
regardless of what port you actually have.  (For instance, mice don't
like the 16c550AF).</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>ClearDTR</CODE> flag may not work properly on some systems,
unless you disable the RTS/CTS handshaking with the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
stty -crtscts &lt; /dev/mouse
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Logitech mice may require the line <CODE>ChordMiddle</CODE> to enable the
middle of the three buttons to work. This line replaces
<CODE>Emulate3Buttons</CODE> or goes after the <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> line
in the config file. You may well need the <CODE>ClearDTR</CODE> and
<CODE>ClearRTS</CODE> lines in your Xconfig.  Some Logitech mice positively
do not need the <CODE>ChordMiddle</CODE> line - one symptom of this
problem is that menus seem to move with the mouse instead of scrolling
down. (From: 
<A HREF="mailto:chang&commat;platform.com">chang&commat;platform.com</A>)</LI>
<LI>Swapping buttons: use the <CODE>xmodmap</CODE>
command to change which physical button registers as
each mouse click. eg: <CODE> xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1" </CODE> will
turn round the buttons for use in the left hand. If you only have a
two-button mouse then it's just numbers 1 &amp; 2. </LI>
<LI>Acceleration: use the <CODE>xset m</CODE> command to change the mouse
settings. eg <CODE>xset m 2 </CODE> will set the acceleration to 2. Look
at the manpage for full details.</LI>
<LI>Pointer offset: If the click action appears to be coming from
the left or right of where the cursor is, it may be that your screen
is not aligned. This is a problem with the S3 driver, which you may
be able to fix using xvidtune. Try <CODE>Invert_VCLK/InvertVCLK,
or EarlySC.</CODE>
This info from Bill Lavender 
(
<A HREF="mailto:lavender&commat;MCS.COM">lavender&commat;MCS.COM</A>) and Simon Hargrave.
In the XF86Config, it might look like this:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Subsection "Display"
    Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "1280x1024"
    Invert_VCLK "*" 1
    ...

<LI>If you are getting `bouncing' of the mouse buttons, ie two clicks
when you only wanted one, there may be something wrong with the
mouse.  This problem has been solved for Logitech mice by
Bob Nichols (
<A HREF="mailto:rnichols&commat;interaccess.com">rnichols&commat;interaccess.com</A>) and involves soldering some
resistors and a chip in the mouse to debounce the microswitches.
</LI>
<LI>If some users cannot get the mouse to work but some (eg root) can,
it is possible that the users are not running exactly the same 
thing - for instance a different version of X or a different Xconfig.
Check the X start-up messages carefully to make sure.
</LI>
<LI>If you find the mouse pointer is erasing things from your screen, you 
have a server config problem.  Try adding the option
<CODE>linear</CODE>, or maybe <CODE>nolinear</CODE> to the graphics card
section, or if it is a PCI board, the options
<CODE>tgui_pci_write_off</CODE> and <CODE>tgui_pci_read_off</CODE>.
(This seems to be a Trident Card problem.)
</LI>
<LI>If the mouse cursor doesn't show up on the screen, but otherwise seems
to be working, try the option <CODE>"sw_cursor"</CODE> in the Device
section of the config file.
</LI>
<LI>If your mouse stops working when its sunny or when you turn a light on,
it may be that the sensors are being swamped by light getting 
through the case.  You could
try painting the inside of the case black, or putting some card
in the top.</LI>
<LI>Microsoft Brand mice are often a cause of problems. The newest ``Microsoft Serial Mouse
2.1A'' has been reported not to work on many systems, although unplugging it and plugging it
in again may help.  <CODE>gpm</CODE> version 1.13 and higher should also
support 2.1A mice, using the <CODE>pnp</CODE> mouse type.  (See the 
<A HREF="#gpm">gpm section</A> for how to re-export this.)
The ``Microsoft Intellimouse'' also
causes problems, although it should now be supported by XFree version 3.3 and later.</LI>
