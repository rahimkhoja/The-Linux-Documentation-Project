<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Knowledge Required</A>
</H2>

<P>Creating a virtual services machine is not all that difficult,  however, 
more than fundamental knowledge is required.  This document is not a primer
to how to fully configure a Linux machine. 
<P>
<P>In order to understand this HOWTO document it is assumed that you
are thoroughly familiar with the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Compiling a Linux kernel and adding IP aliasing support

<LI> Setting up of inetd
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/NET-3-HOWTO.html">NET-3 HOWTO</A></LI>
<LI> Various network packages like

<A HREF="http://www.apache.org">Apache</A>
<A HREF="http://www.qmail.org">Qmail</A>

</UL>
<P>If you are uncertain of how to proceed with any of the above it is STRONGLY
recommended that you use the html links provided to familiarize yourself with all
packages.  I will NOT reply to mail regarding any of the above.  Please
direct your questions to the appropriate author of the HOWTO.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Purpose</A>
</H2>

<P>The purpose of virtual services is to allow a single machine to
recognize multiple IP addresses without multiple network cards.
IP aliasing is a kernel option that allows you to assign each network 
device more than one IP address.  The kernel then multiplexes 
(swaps between them very fast) in the background and to the user it 
appears like you have more than one server.   
<P>
<P> 
This multiplexing allows multiple domains (www.domain1.com, 
www.domain2.com, etc.) to be hosted by the same machine for the same 
cost as hosting one domain.  Unfortunately, most services (FTP, web, mail) 
were not designed to handle muliple domains.  In order to make them work
properly you must modify both configuration files and source code. 
This document describes how to make these modifications in the setting
up of a virtual machine.
<P>
<P>A deamon is also required in order to make virtual services function.  The
source for this daemon (virtuald) is provided later in this document.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Feedback</A>
</H2>

<P>This document will expand as packages are updated and source or configuration
modifications change.   If there are any portions of this document that
are unclear please feel free to email me with your suggestions or
questions.  So that I do not have to go searching through the entire
HOWTO please make certain that all comments are as specific as possible
and include the section where the uncertainty lies.  It is important that
all mail be addressed with VIRTSERVICES HOWTO in the subject line.  Any other mail
will be considered personal and all my friends know that I do not ever 
read my personal mail so it will probably get discarded with theirs.
<P>
<P>Please note that my examples are just that, examples and should not
be copied verbatim.   You may have to insert your own values.   If you
are having trouble, send me mail.  Include all the pertinent configuration files
and the error messages you get when installing and I will look
them over and reply with my suggestions.
