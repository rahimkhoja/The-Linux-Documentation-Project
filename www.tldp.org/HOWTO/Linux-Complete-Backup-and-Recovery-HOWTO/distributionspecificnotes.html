>For me the best thing about using Knoppix is that I don't need a specific boot medium for each machine, but I can use the same tools all the time. And hardware support in Knoppix is really great. I don't have that much experience with different platforms, but all the machines I've tried have worked fine, scsi drivers are found and so on.</P
><P
>I'm doing this recovery thing by copying the backups over the network to other machine. The restore involves booting the Knoppix cd, fetching the metadata.tar.gz from the network machine. Then make.dev, mount.dev, fetching the other tar.gz files, grub and reboot. Some typing involved but thanks to your scripts it's quite straighforward. Unless changing from ide to scsi or something, but even then it's not that difficult, since Linux is easy to restore to different hardware.</P

>Let me add to that that <A

HREF="http://www.knoppix.org/"

>Knoppix</A
>, we tar the first stage stuff saving numeric user &#38; group values instead of by name. The names may point to different numbers on knoppix, so we would be restoring the files incorrectly.</P

>7.3. finnix</H2

><A
HREF="Http://Www.Finnix.Org/"

>Finnix</A
> has some of the same advantages of Knoppix. In addition, it runs in command line mode with mouse support, which is great for the task at hand. It's small, under 100 MB as of this writing, so you can remaster it with your first stage data on it. It boots quickly. And it has LVM support. And Zile, a subset of Emacs. I am pleased with <A
