>Having made your production backups, you need to preserve your partition information so that you can rebuild your partitions.</P
><P
>The script <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.FDISK"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.fdisk</TT
></A
> scans a hard drive for partition information, and saves it in three files. The first is an executable script, called <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.DEV.HDA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.dev.x</TT
></A
> (where <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"x"</SPAN
> is the name of the device file, e.g. hda). Second is <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MOUNT.DEV.HDA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>mount.dev.x</TT
></A
>, which creates mount points and mounts the newly created partitions on them. The last, <A
HREF="thescripts.html#DEV.HDA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dev.x</TT
></A
>, is the commands necessary for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fdisk</B
> to build the partitions. You specify which hard drive you want to build scripts for (and thus the file names) by naming the associated device file as the argument to <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.FDISK"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.fdisk</TT

><TT

><P
>In addition, if <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.FDISK"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.fdisk</TT
></A
> encounters a FAT partition, it preserves the partition's boot sector in a file named <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dev.xy</TT
>, where x is the drive's device name (e.g. sdc, hda) and y is the partition number. The boot sector is the first sector, 512 bytes, of the partition. This sector is restored at the same time the partitions are rebuilt, in the script <A
HREF="thescripts.html#MAKE.DEV.HDA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make.dev.hda</TT
></A
>.</P
><P
>Fortunately, the price of hard drives is plummeting almost as fast as the public's trust in politicians after an election. So it is good that the output files are text, and allow hand editing. That's the most difficult but most flexible way to rebuild on a larger replacement drive. (See the <A
HREF="whatnow.html#TODO"
>To Do list</A
>.)</P
><P
>Other metadata are preserved in the script <A
HREF="thescripts.html#SAVE.METADATA"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>save.metadata</TT
></A
>. The script saves the partition information in the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fdisk.hda</TT
> in the root of the ZIP disk. It is a good idea to print this file and your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> so that you have hard copy should you ever have to restore the partition data manually. You can save a tree by toggling between two virtual consoles, running <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fdisk</B
> in one and catting <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/fdisk.hda</TT
> as needed. However, doing so is error prone.</P
><P
>You will also want to preserve files relevant to your restoration method. For example, if you use nfs to save your data, you will need to preserve hosts.allow, hosts.deny, exports, etc. Also, if you are using any network-backed restoration process, such as Amanda or Quick Restore, you will need to preserve networking files like HOSTNAME, hosts, etc. and the relevant software tree.</P
><P
>The simplest way to handle these and similar questions is to preserve the entire etc directory.</P
><P
>There is no way a 100 MB ZIP drive is going to hold a server installation of a modern distribution of Linux. We have to be much more selective than simply preserving the whole kazoo. What files do we need?</P

>These days many computers come with a CD-ROM drive but no floppy diskette. And floppy drives do fail. So it's a good idea to burn your CD-ROM with a bootable image on it. The bad news is that the <SPAN

>The only down side of this process is that many older BIOSes do not support 2.88 MB floppy images on CD-ROMs. Most of those will boot to a <A
