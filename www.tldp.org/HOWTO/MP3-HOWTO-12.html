<P>So, hopefully, you should now have some MP3 files ready to listen to, and have the choice of playing from file or stream.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 Playing from File</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Playing from file is reasonably straight-forward with all players. The only big difference is some are command-line based and some are X based.
<P>Playing an MP3 file from file requires you to pass the mp3 file as a parameter, like so:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ mpg123 /mp3_files/SampleFile.mp3

or

[dj@megajukebox]$ xaudio /mp3_files/SampleFile.mp3
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>If you want to play a series of files, pass them in as a list:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ alsaplayer /mp3_files/SampleFile1.mp3 /mp3_files/SampleFile2.mp3
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>To play all the tracks in a directory, just wildcard the file selected, like so:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ xmms /mp3_files/*.mp3
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Playing from MP3 Streams</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Playing from a MP3 stream is quite easy, just replace the file with the streams url and port number:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ mpg123 http://localhost:8000

or

[dj@megajukebox]$ freeamp http://megajukebox:2711

<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 Capturing MP3 Streams</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To capture an MP3 stream using streamripper, type the following:

<H3>eMixer</H3>

<P>
<P>eMixer gives you the ability to mix MP3's in a similar manner to a DJ's mixing desk.
<P>Newer versions support 2 sound cards so you can output your mix on one card and monitor or cue the next track on another.
<P>As usual once untaring, read the readme on how to build the package.
<P>You will need to create a playlist of MP3 files, do this with the find command mentioned in the Streaming section.
<P>You will need mpg123 installed before you can run eMixer.
