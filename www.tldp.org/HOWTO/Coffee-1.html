For a long time humanity has been wondering how could a computer make coffee...
<P>People need coffee to wake up, and stay awake for a long time in front of the computer. 
It is common wisdom that coding is better at night!
<P>
<P>The main trick is interfacing a coffee machine to the computer, 
so that it can be controlled by software. This HOWTO will show you how to do so.
<P>At first, it demonstrates an ON/OFF switch implemented as an electronic circuit 
which controls the coffee-machine's power supply.
Another chapter will tell you the secrets of building 
intelligent, Turing Complete suitable, coffee machines!
<P>This HOWTO was initially written as part of a debate in the mailing list linux-greek-users,
on whether linux can make coffee or not. It then became an article in our online magazine 
called 
<A HREF="http://magaz.hellug.gr">magaz</A>.
Just in case you wondered, magaz is in Greek and it will surely look like that to you!
<P>
<P>Enjoy.

<P>The Coffee HOWTO is now called Coffee Making HOWTO and heads for release v1.0, which will first appear somewhere here:
<P>

<P>It is about time for everyone to know that Coffee Making is just one of 
the standard features that come for free with *any* Linux distribution.
Or, does SCO have a patent on that, too? Gee...

<LI>Ethiopia: Identified as the originating country of coffee. </LI>
<LI>Coffee was popular in the Middle East for ages, 
until a failed invasion of the Turks at the city of Vienna at 1683
left behind sacks with strange brown beans nobody wanted:

<P>Well, to the best of my knowledge, this is a dope-free work.
<P>But, I can tell you the secret of the music playing on the background:
nearly any song spelled by Zampetas or Mpithikotsis (bouzouki and such).

<LI>Your suggestions won't be wasted, I really tend to travel quite a lot these days and might be around before your realize it.</LI>
<LI>Yes, I have been in Amsterdam and even lived there for three years;
coffee shops generally don't account as cafe's!</LI>
<LI>Surprise: I actually prefer chocolate and tea over coffee. ;-)</LI>
