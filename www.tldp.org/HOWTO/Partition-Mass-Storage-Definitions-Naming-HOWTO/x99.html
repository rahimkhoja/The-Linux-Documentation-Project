    to mass storage that must be understood.</P

>5.1. Naming Convention</H2
><P
>Linux used to deal with two kind of drives, depending
      of the electronic interface (controller), IDE and SCSI.
      Oldtimers remember the day where cdwriters where acccessed
      through "SCSI emulation". In fact IDE and SCSI use mostly the
      same low level commands and for 2007 up, with the new "SATA"
      interface, the naming was unified and, in new ditributions,
      all the drives have the same naming. For this part, CD or DVD
      readers/writers are seen like Hard Drives.</P

CLASS="section"

>5.1.1. Old IDE Names</H3
><P
>By convention, IDE drives where given device names 
        <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>/dev/hda</FONT
>to 
        <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>/dev/hdd</FONT
>. 
        <EM
>H</EM
>ard 
        <EM
>D</EM
>rive 
        <EM
>A</EM
>(
        <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>/dev/hda</FONT
>) is the first drive and 
        <EM
>H</EM
>ard 
        <EM
>D</EM
>rive 
        <EM
>C</EM
>(
        <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>/dev/hdc</FONT
>) is the third.</P
><P
>A typical PC has two IDE controllers, each of which
        can have two drives connected to it. For example, 
        <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>/dev/hda</FONT
>is the first drive (master) on the
        first IDE controller and 
        <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>/dev/hdd</FONT
>is the second (slave) drive on the
        second controller (the fourth IDE drive in the
        computer).</P
><P
>So, typically, a computer with IDE controller can
        accomodate 4 drives: /dev/hda (primary master), /dev/hdb
        (primary slave), /dev/hdc (secondary master), /dev/hdd
        (secondary slave). Some (rare) Mother Boards have more than
        two controllers, some addition cards can also have
        controllers, these are numbered following the alphabet, but
        one have to figure out what real names are given for his
        particular hardware.</P
><P
>You can have drives where ever you want, it's not
        mandatory to fill the gaps. You may have interest to read
        about what drive/cdrom connect to what place, but it's out
        of this document scope.</P

>5.1.2. New Hard Drives Names</H3
><P
>Now all the rotating hard drives uses the same names
        as the old SCSI controllers, that is "s" in place of "h",
        so /dev/sda, and so on. The number of drives depends on the
        number of controllers on the Mother Board or the extended
        boards. Usually 4 are available. What will be the number of
        a drive is up to the controller card and the way it's read
        by the kernel, so difficult to say at first.</P

>Flash drives are usually not connected through IDE or
        SATA interfaces and so don't uses the same names. Several
        interfaces are used with each different names. The kernel
        documentations gives the names.</P
