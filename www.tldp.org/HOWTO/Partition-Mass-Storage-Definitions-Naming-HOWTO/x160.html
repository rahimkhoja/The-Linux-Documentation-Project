>Partition naming is thanksfully simpler than drive one.
      Partitions are simply given a number from 0 up (decimal).
      Sometime a "p" is appended on front of the number:</P

>Max number of partitions is 15 for SCSI and all the
      drives using the new SATA driver, 63 for IDE drives (0 is the
      full drive, 0 to 15 is four bits 0 to 64, 6 bits)</P

>6.2. Meaning of the Numbers</H2
><P
>Not all the numbers have the same meaning. This mess
      come from the PC history. One can divide floppies with
      partitions, but then 4 ones seems sufficient. But then come
      Hard drives :-). So the partitons numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 
      <EM
>primary</EM
>partitions. One drive can only
      have 4 primaries.</P
><P
>To go further, we have to use one of these primary as a
      big one and sub-partition this one, so to have 
      <EM
>logical</EM
>partitions. The big 
      <EM
>extended</EM
>partition can be any of the
      4.</P
><P
>So, remember, the primary partitions are inside the
      drive and the logical partitions are inside one of the
      primary, called the 
      <EM
>extended</EM
>partition.</P
><P
>Once the logical partitions are created, it's no more
      recommended to write directly to the extended one. Writing to
      an extended partition would erase the logical ones like
      writing directly to a hard drive erase the partitons. Beware,
      
      <STRONG
>it's possible</STRONG
>!!</P
><P
>If, after creating 4 primary partitions, all the disk
      space is not used, the remaining space is lost (unusable), so
      most of the time, create the desired primaries, then at last
      the extended one with all the remaining room.</P
><P
>It's not necessary to create 4 primaries. You could use
      only one extended (Linux only), but there are some advantages
      of using primaries.</P
><P
>Primaries being 4, the first logical partition is
      always 5. So any partition with number of five and up is a
      logical one.</P
