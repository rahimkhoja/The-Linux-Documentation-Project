><P
>Many definitions about drives are only virtual. That is
      they are used, but the hardware is often quite different from
      the expected description. Usually this have no odd result,
      any mass storage have to be seen as a 
      <EM

>4.2. Bytes</H2
><P
>Computers counts with binaries, 1 &#38; 0,
      1111100001110... To be able to read this better, humans uses
      nibbles (4 bits) often shown as Hexadecimal numbers from 0 to
      f (0123456789abcdef). Nibbles are usually grouped by two and
      this gives a byte. The most used memory unit is byte and it's
      multiples, KiB (Kilo Bytes), MiB (Mega Bytes), GiB
      (Gigabytes). The "i" denotes the binary use (0ne Ki is 1024,
      not 1000), the uppercase "B" denotes Bytes, not bits.</P

><P
>Sometime, the word

      <EM

>.</P
><P
>Mass storage devices (at least the ones we are dealing
      with here) store bytes in "Sectors" of 512 Bytes. This is
      uneven, because any sector count have to be divided by two to
      have the KiB number, so most partitonning software accepts
      letters k (KiB), m (MiB), g... as options. Wise ones do not
      make any case difference.</P
><P
>Sector size is the available byte count. The true
      sector is bigger, as it have to include housekeeping data.
      You don't have to worry about that.</P
><P
>Notice that as of 03-22-2006, the IDEMA annouced a new
      sector size of 4kiB (4096 Bytes):

>4.4. Heads</H2
><P
>Rotating mass storage devices uses 
      <EM
>heads</EM
>. True heads are the physical
      electromechanical device that writes and read the magnetic
      track. Drives being made of rotating plates, the plates have
      two sides, so disks can have two head by plate. Having two
      plates (frequent) you have four heads.</P
><P
>Heads are writing through very complex system, see
      detailed info here:

>4.5. Tracks</H2
><P
>Plates are rotating. When a head is still, the plate
      rotation and the width of the head are defining a
      track.</P
><P
>Heads are moving from the external part of the plate to
      the inner part, step by steps. Each step defines a new
      track.</P

>4.6. Cylinders</H2
><P
>Heads are moving together, all at the same time. They
      may rotate - on they own center, not the plate center, of
      course. They also may have a linear move. You can see an
      example of linear moving head in any cdreader, looking at the
      move of the laser head. Most disks are as shown by this
      wikipedia image

>.</P
><P
>When you think of all the tracks defined by each head
      at the same time, you have a cylinder. So on a rotating
      drive, all the tracks of the same cylinder are read or
      written at the same time. The actual data is spread on all
      the plates. The way the data is actually written is up to the
      drive manufacturer, not the user.</P

>4.7. Disks</H2
><P
>Small disks are used directly as a hole bunch of
      sectors. Basic programs can access data directly on sectors.
      Many do (like dd or any partitionning programm).</P
><P
>But we live in a world of extremely high capacity mass
      storage. Terabytes is normal nowaday (2009), when a complete
      Linux system can live on a floppy (1440 bytes). So there is a
      need of making several parts from a mass storage device,
      though the partitions.</P

>4.8. Partitions</H2
><P
>Partitioning is a means to divide a single drive into
      many logical drives. A partition is a contiguous set of
      sectors. To lessen the heads travel, partitions can be
      "aligned" on the cylinder size, that is use an integer number
      of cylinder. This is not always done, but should as it have
      many other advantages for recovery.</P

>4.9. Partition Table</H2
><P
>As you can have many partitions, you need to have a
      partition table. This partition table is stored in the very
      beginning of the drive. It's very unlikely that you will have
      to change this table directly writing bytes with an
      hexadecimal editor, so we wont say more on the position of
      the table.</P
><P
>There are many Operating Systems all around that all
      share similar hardware and as many partition systems. We will
      look only at what one can find in a PC, even if it's not easy
      to define that nowaday. Say, for us, a PC is any computer
      able to run Linux (I know, it's not always true).</P
><P
>Each of these partition kinds are noted in the table by
      a special flag called "type" ("t" in fdisk). Most known are
      type 83 for Linux partitions and 82 for Linux swap (hex
      numbers).</P
><P
>Notice that most Operating Systems can share partition
      tables. At least, if a disk is hardware compatible with
      several systems, these systems should be able to see what the
      others have done, not to erase a drive by accident. I can't
      say for sure that its true in the real life.</P

>4.10. File Systems</H2
><P
>Partitions can be accessed directly as sectors, as any
      part of the disk, but are usually filled with a 
      <STRONG
>file system</STRONG
>. File system
      and partitions are related only because a file system is in a
      partition, but that's all. You can have a disk without
      partition but with a file system or have partitions without
      file system (the swap partition beeing the most well known).
      For details on file systems,

      Wikipedia</A
>.</P
><P
>In summary, file systems allow storing data in files
      with human readable names and to sort the files in a friendly
      way, for example as directories, subdirectories, text,
      images...</P

>4.11. Files and Nodes</H2
><P
>Nearly all what you can find on a mass storage
      partition, beside sectors, from an user point of view, is a
      file. But computers are curious geeks and you can treat files
      like disks if you want. Using the "loop" system, default in
      most Linux kernels, one can partition the inside of the file,
      create file systems on it and mount it. This is specially
      handy for experiments.</P
><P
>Some of these files are 
      <EM
>devices</EM
>or 
      <EM
>nodes</EM
>. Partitions are not files and are
      accessed via special nodes we will see later. These nodes are
      not created by touch but by 
      <EM
>mknode</EM
>. Use with caution. Nodes need a
      type (
      <EM
>c</EM
>for "character" or "b" for 
      <EM
>block</EM
>) and major and minor numbers. For
      what we need, major numbers are disk numbers and minor
      numbers are partition numbers. The list is visible in
      /proc/partitions</P
