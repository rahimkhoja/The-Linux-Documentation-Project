<P>This document describes a simple three step procedure for using Loadlin
to dual boot between Linux and Windows 95/98/ME. If you prefer to use
the LILO boot manager, please consult the 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Linux+Win95.html">Linux+Win95 Mini-HOWTO</A>.
<P>
<P>This version of this mini-HOWTO has been completely rewritten with
major differences from the previous version (1.4.6). The following
highlight the major differences:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Name change. The Loadlin+Win95/98/ME mini-HOWTO was formerly known as "The
Loadlin+Win95 mini-HOWTO. The change was made to more accurately
reflect the topic covered herein.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The focus has changed from Win95 to Win98, and as a result this
mini-HOWTO is simpler and easier to follow. Microsoft made some changes
in the way Windows boots in Win98, which has made most of the dual boot
methods for Win95 incompatable with Win98. If you still wish to see the
Win95 specific mini-HOWTO you can view it
