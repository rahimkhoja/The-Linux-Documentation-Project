<P>2003-11-19</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="Linux+WinNT.html#toc7.1">Description of the products used in this experiment</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>Notice: Folks, that part of the article is <B>NOT</B> a commercial 
for HP production of any means! In fact, a series of their machines I use has lots
of failures in the power supply units, as well as with their hard disks. On
the other side, laptop's batteries get exhausted earlier than expected.
Other than these issues, HP machines are fine.</EM></P>

<P><B>HP Omnibook 6000</B></P>
<P>A laptop computer Omnibook 6000 is equipped with a bootable DVD 
drive. On the other hand I have supplied a bootable DVD-ROM 
with Mandrake Linux 9.1 installation. After booting the laptop with 
that bootable DVD, it gets directly to the installation menu,
asking the user to choose a language to use for the rest of the
installation.</P>

<P><B>HP Vectra VL420 (used as a server)</B></P>
<P>In opposite, an HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it only
has a CD drive), so the direct installation from that particular
installation DVD is not possible. But, an option of making
a bootable floppy disk for starting the installation procedure 
<EM>is</EM> possible. In fact, several boot images are available 
for those users who don't have (bootable or not) DVD drive. One 
of the images is a 'network' one. That means, in a local area network 
there has to be either a NFS, FTP or HTTP server from which the 
installation will take place.</P>

<P><B>HP Vectra VL420 (used as a workstation)</B></P>
<P>Another VL420 desktop system I also use, has a spare HDD from a 
previous Windows 2000 server installation (actually, that IDE disk was moved 
from the other computer where it was a primary one and here it is the second
one disk for backup data). The nice things is that it has a HTTP and FTP 
servers installed (of course, usable if the system is boot from that disk). 
That was good so I could use one of these servers now. On the other hand,
that particular Vectra VL420 was used to install a workstation kind of Linux
(that time, using its first hard disk - having Windows 2000 Professional).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="Linux+WinNT.html#toc7.2">Installation procedure</A>
</H2>

<P><B>System boot of the laptop</B></P>
<P>As explained earlier, the laptop has a bootable DVD drive, so that's it.</P>
<P><B>System boot of desktop machines</B></P>
<P>So, I made a 'network' bootable floppy and booted the first Vectra 
VL420 (intended to be a Linux server) with it. After a while, it 
came to a point to choose the installation method (NFS or FTP or 
HTTP server). At first, I wanted to use the second 'spare' HTTP 
server on the other Vectra, but regardless of what permission I tried 
to give to the 'Everyone' group of Windows users, I always got the 
following answer from the Linux setup:</P>
<P>Error: Couldn't get file ... (or something like that)</P>
<P>Then I tried to use the 'spare' FTP server from the second Vectra and, at
first, it also asked for local and remote IP addresses. That time successfully, 
it started to load a part of the remote Linux files into its memory without
any complaint. Soon after, it came to the very same position as Omnibook 
6000 did: it got directly to the installation menu, asking a user to choose 
a language for the installation use.</P>
<P>>From that point, the setup process was almost the same...</P>
<P>I have chosen/confirmed the following items:</P>
<P>- a language to use, besides English(American) as default: I added 
Unicode and Serbian (both Cyrillic and Latin);
- a mouse and keyboard;
- a security level - I accepted defaults: 'Standard' for laptop and 'Higher'
for server;</P>
<P>The next important task was to choose one of <EM>DrakX</EM> 
partitioning options: </P>
<P>- for laptop I chose the 'Use the free space on the Windows
partition', because the laptop has one IDE hard disk and I wanted 
it to use a part of it for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.
already installed). Windows' Disk Management reported: </P>

<P>
<PRE>
Disk 0  15      MB      FAT     (HP Diagnostics or like)
        7.13    GB      FAT32   (C: "HPNOTEBOOK")
        20.80   GB      Free space
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The two partitions (FAT &amp; FAT32) were made during the installation 
procedure, using HP's supplied installation CD's.</P>
<P>At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
"was too fragmented" and required me to reboot under Windows, run
the "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.
The defragmentation process have taken cca. 1.5 hour to be completed!
When restarted the setup, it wanted to use 7.13 GB Windows partition, 
instead of 20.80 GB. I chose to 'Use the free space'. Then it made partitions
for Linux: /dev/hda5 and /dev/hda7.</P>
<P>- for Vectra VL420 I used 'Custom disk partitioning' because there 
I had two SCSI disks, one of them running Windows 2000 Server
already installed, and the other one I wanted to use entirely for a
Linux server. BTW, I wasn't sure what the option 'Erase entire disk'
would do during its next step (erase a whole disk or a partition?), 
although it also may be the proper solution too. <EM>DrakX</EM> 
recognized the two SCSI disks as <B>sda</B> and <B>sdb</B> 
and I chose <B>sdb</B> to install Linux. The first step was to 'Clear 
all' and after that to 'Auto allocate' the space on that second disk. 
Finally, after a 'Done' it appeared to make /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb6 
Linux partitions.</P>
<P><B>Package Group Selection</B></P>
<P>Per default, the Mandrake 9.1 setup offers the following to be
installed:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- Office Workstation
- Internet Workstation
- KDE Workstation
- Gnome Workstation
</PRE>
</P>
<P>that is in sum: Total size 1010/5267 (at laptop) and 1066/5265 (at server).</P>
<P>- for laptop I added all that was available, <EM>excepting</EM> 6 'Server' 
items (1612/5267),</P>
<P>- for server I added all that was available, <EM>including</EM> 6 'Server' 
items (1708/5265).</P>
<P>Then I got an info, related to selecting following servers (?) on laptop:</P>
<P>cups, postfix, rwho, webmin</P>
<P>and on server box:</P>
<P>cups, openssh-server, postfix, proftpd, rwho, webmin, ypserv, bind and
nfs-utils.</P>
<P>Although I was confused about the 'servers' to be installed on a laptop,
I have accepted those things to be installed, considering them needed 
for the proper installation of other packages.</P>
<P>The installation started ...</P>
<P>Interestingly, although the installation on the laptop was performed
directly from its DVD drive, the package installation process was 
significantly faster on the server box. I suppose that was due the 
difference in performances between server's SCSI disk and laptop's 
IDE disk.</P>
<P>After that step was finished, and after entering a password for root, setup
asked to 'Enter a user' (an ordinary user). The difference between laptop
and server installation was that the latter offered some additional tasks
for the (ordinary) user:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- access to compilation tools (ctools)
- access to rpm tools (rpm)
- access to X programs (xgrp)
- access to network tools (ntools)
- access to administrative files (adm)
- allow "su" (wheel)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>... and that should be the same for other (new added) users.</P>
<P>Then laptop suggested to 'set up computer to automatically log on one user'.
I didn't accept such a solution because I wanted each user to enter his/her 
password <EM>every</EM> time he/she is about to log on to the system.</P>
<P>On the other hand, server's setup skipped that particular step and asked 
where to install the bootloader. I have chosen to use 'First sector of drive (MBR)'.</P>
<P>Soon after, a 'Summary' screen appeared, so I could fine tune the installation.
I changed the following items:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- timezone: Belgrade (both machines)
- Graphical Interface (reported as 'not configured' on the laptop? - I tried 
   with 'Flat Panel 1400 x 1050' because that resolution runs fine under 
   Windows), X server: Rage Mobility, XFree 4.3 and 16 million colors - 
   24 bits). On laptop, I chose XFree to start when I reboot. On server, it 
   offered 800 x 600 - due to a recognized monitor Samsung SyncMaster 
   510(M)s (CHA5807*) and card ATI Rage 128 and 16 bit - 65 thousand color.
- Sound card: laptop is ESS Technology|ES1983S Maestro-3i|PCI Audio and
   server is Intel Corporation|ICH2 810 Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller.
- Network: with 'Use auto detection'. Results: on laptop it recognized 'LAN
   connection - ethernet card(s) detected'; on server it recognized
   nothing. So, on server I chose to configure 'LAN connection'.
   Drivers are: 3c59x (laptop), eepro100 (server).
   IP addresses for both laptop and server.
   Host name: laptop, server, Gateway:
- Firewall: disabled (def.)
- Botloader: lilo-graphic on /dev/hda (laptop)
   lilo-graphic on /dev/sda (server)
   default boot: windows on /dev/hda2 (laptop)
   windows on /dev/sda1 (server)
- Services: 32 activated for 47 registered (laptop)
   24 activated for 60 registered (server)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Soon after ...</P>
<P><CODE>Congratulations, installation is complete.</CODE></P>
<P>(reboot)</P>

<P><B>Installation results</B></P>
<P>The next Windows boot made a screen 'System Settings Change': Windows 
2000 has finished installing new devices. You must restart your computer
before the new settings will take effect. Do you want to restart
your computer now? Well, I said </P>
<P>Windows' Disk Management has showed new Linux partitions:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- laptop:       5.85 GB         Healthy \
Disk 0          495 MB          Healthy - all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
27.95 GB        14.46 GB        Healthy /

- server:       5.85 GB         Healthy - primary partition
Disk 1          494 MB          Healthy \
17.12 GB        10.79 GB        Healthy - these 2 are logical drives within the extended one
</PRE>
</P>
<P>It seems that <CODE>/boot</CODE> and <CODE>/swap</CODE> partitions are very similar in size, 
regardless the disk sizes, but <CODE>/</CODE> (root, home etc) partitions depend on 
disk size. Note that at my 'laptop' box I used the same HD of 27.95 GB for both 
Windows and Linux (for Windows 7.13 GB FAT32 of 27.95 GB available, the rest, 
cca. 20 GB for Linux). </P>
<P>At the 'server' box I have two HD's of 17.12 GB each, and I used Disk 0 (the 1st 
one) entirely for Windows 2000 Server, and Disk 1 (the 2nd one) entirely for Linux. </P>
<P>The first Mandrake Linux boot screen:</P>
<P>- laptop: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
Reboot and Halt buttons.</P>
<P>- server: a screen with 'Enter Login', 'Enter Password' and 'Session type' (no
name of a user appeared).</P>
<P>First Time Wizard: Default KDE (both)</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>What about the Ctrl-Alt-Del action:</P>
<P>- laptop: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do next?
Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer, OK and Cancel
buttons.</P>
<P>- server: a screen 'End Session for "username"', Logout and Cancel buttons.</P>
<P>After choosing Login as different user (at laptop), or Logout (at server), what
appeared were the same screens as described in 'The first Mandrake Linux boot 
screen' section.</P>
<P>Should you want to learn more about LILO (<B>Li</B>nux <B>Lo</B>ader), configured to
boot the systems in the examples above, you should refer to the
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html">LILO</A> mini-HOWTO.</P>

<P><B>HP Vectra VL420 (workstation - desktop client)</B></P>
<P>As mentioned before, HP Vectra VL420 doesn't have a DVD drive (it 
only has a CD drive), so the installation from that particular
DVD installation was not possible. But, an option of making
a bootable floppy disk for it was possible. In fact, several
boot images are available for those users who don't have
(bootable or not) DVD drive. One of the images was a 'network'
one. That means, in a local network there should be a NFS, FTP
or HTTP server from which the installation will take place.
As earlier explained, a Windows 2000 server machine (that I 
earlier used for Mandrake Linux server installation), has HTTP 
and FTP servers installed. That was good so I could use 
one of them now.</P>
<P>So, I used the 'network' bootable floppy and booted Vectra VL420 
with it. After a while, it came to a point to choose the installation 
method (NFS or FTP or HTTP server). At first I wanted to use my 
HTTP server but regardless of what permission I gave to 'Everyone' 
I always got the answer from Linux installation program: 
Error: Couldn't get file ...</P>
<P>Then I tried to use my FTP server (on the same Windows server)
and it also asked for IP local and remote addresses. Then it
started to load a part of the remote files into its memory.
Soon after, it came to the very same position as Omnibook 6000 
did: it gets directly to the installation menu,
asking for choosing a language to use.</P>
<P>>From that point, the installation procedure was almost the same...</P>
<P>I have chosen/confirmed the following items:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- a language to use - besides English(American) I also added
Unicode and Serbian, both Cyrillic and Latin;
- a mouse and keyboard;
- a security level - default 'Standard';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The next important point was to choose one of DrakX partitioning
options: </P>
<P>- At first I used the 'Use the free space on the Windows
partition' because it has one IDE hard disk and I wanted it to
use a part of it for Linux (besides existing Windows 2000 Prof.
already installed). </P>
<P>At the first moment, Linux setup complained that my Windows partition
"was too fragmented" and asked me to reboot under Windows, run
the "defrag" utility, then restart the Mandrake Linux installation.
After defragmentation process was finished, I tried once again the
'Use the free space on the Windows partition' but it wanted just
to 'shrink' Windows partition from cca. 30 gig to cca. 28 gig. Then
I used Partition Magic software and tried to shrink it to cca. 20 GB
in order to get more free space for Linux.</P>
<P>Than I tried 'Custom disk partitioning', chose the first IDE disk
(hda) of 27GB, chose action 'Resize'. That one option was not good
because it just offered Windows partition to get larger instead of
smaller than before. Finally I used 'Use the free space' and it
automatically made Linux partitions. In fact, on that one Vectra I 
have two IDE disks, one of them having Windows 2000 Server
already installed, and the other one having Windows 2000 Prof. that
I wanted to use partly for Linux. After 'Done' it came to making 
/dev/hda5 and /dev/hda7.</P>
<P><B>Package Group Selection</B></P>
<P>Per default, Mandrake installation offers the following:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- Office Workstation
- Internet Workstation
- KDE Workstation
- Gnome Workstation
</PRE>
</P>
<P>in sum, Total size 1009/5105 (client).</P>
<P>- for client I added everything else (1638/5105), excepting 6 'Server' items.</P>
<P>Then I got an info, related to selecting following server(s) on client:</P>
<P>cups, postfix, rwho, webmin</P>
<P>I have accepted those things to be installed.</P>
<P>The installation started ...</P>
<P>After that step was finished, and after entering password for root, setup
asked to 'Enter a user' (an ordinary user). The difference between client
and server installation was that the latter offered some additional tasks
for the user:</P>

<P>

- access to administrative files (adm)
- allow "su" (wheel)

</P>
<P>... and that would be the same for other (new added) users.</P>
<P>Then client suggested to 'set up computer to automatically log on one user'.
I didn't accept that because I wanted each user to enter his/her password
every time he/she is about to login to the system.</P>
<P>Soon after, a 'Summary' screen appeared, so I could tune the installation.
I changed the following items:</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- timezone: Belgrade
- Graphical Interface: it offered 1280 x 1024 - due to a 'custom' monitor
   and card NVIDIA GeForce2 DDR (generic) - 24 bit 16 million colors.
- Sound card: Intel Corporation|ICH2 810 Chipset AC'97 Audio Controller.
- Network: with 'Use auto detection'. Results: recognized nothing. So, I 
   chose to configure 'LAN connection'.
   Driver is: eepro100.

   Host name: client, Gateway:
- Firewall: disabled (def.)
- Botloader: lilo-graphic on /dev/hda
   default boot: windows on /dev/hda1

</PRE>
</P>
<P>Soon after ...</P>
<P><CODE>Congratulations, installation is complete.</CODE></P>
<P>(reboot)</P>

<P><B>Installation results (all 3 systems)</B></P>
<P>
<PRE>
- laptop options: windows, linux, failsafe, floppy;
- client options: windows, linux, linux-nonfb, failsafe, windows2, floppy
- server options: windows, linux, linux-nonfb, linux-secure, failsafe
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Notes: </P>

<P>- 'windows2' option at the client box is, in fact, Windows 2000
Server installation located on the second HD. </P>
<P>- Not sure why 'laptop' doesn't have 'linux-nonfb' <EM>text</EM> boot option, 
although it looks like it boots to Linux in just like that mode (maybe it is a matter 
of the laptop's LCD screen capabilities or something like that). On the other hand, 
client and server differ in floppy and linux-secure options (perhaps as some 
security measures or like).</P>
<P>- 'linux-secure' option at the server box may be a result of a 'Higher' security
level, that I have chosen at the beginning of the installation or, maybe, there are
some special server security features.</P>
<P>The next Windows boot made a screen 'System Settings Change': Windows 2000
has finished installing new devices. You must restart your computer
before the new settings will take effect. Do you want to restart
your computer now? Well, I said Yes.</P>
<P>Windows Disk Management has showed new Linux partitions 
(comparison of 3 systems):</P>

<P>
<PRE>
- laptop:       5.85 GB         Healthy \
Disk 0          495 MB          Healthy - all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
27.95 GB        14.46 GB        Healthy /

- client:       5.68 GB         Healthy \
Disk 0          494 MB          Healthy - all 3 are logical drives within the extended one
37.28 GB        3.52GB          Healthy / (same as laptop)

- server:       5.85 GB         Healthy - primary partition
Disk 1          494 MB          Healthy \
17.12 GB        10.79 GB        Healthy - these two are logical drives within extended
</PRE>
</P>
<P>It seems that <CODE>/boot</CODE> and <CODE>/swap</CODE> partitions are very similar in size, 
regardless the disk sizes, but <CODE>/</CODE> (root, home etc) partitions depend on disk 
size. Note that at my 'client' box I used the same HD of 37.28 GB for both 
Windows and Linux (for Windows 27.60 GB NTFS of 37.28 GB available, the rest, 
cca. 10 GB for Linux). </P>
<P>At the 'server' box I have two HD's of 17.12 GB each, and I used Disk 0 (the 1st 
one) entirely for Windows 2000 Server, and Disk 1 (the 2nd one) entirely for Linux. 
That's why Mandrake setup allocated 'less' space for / at the larger disk (in fact, 
at the 'server' box, it allocated relatively much more space for / even that HD 
is smaller - because that HD is 'dedicated' for Linux only.</P>
<P>The first Mandrake Linux boot screen:</P>
<P>- laptop: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
Reboot and Halt buttons.</P>
<P>- client: a screen with only a name of a user (no root available!),
Reboot and Halt buttons.</P>
<P>- server: a screen with 'Enter Login', 'Enter Password' and 'Session type' (no
name of a user appeared, but root may also login there!).</P>
<P>First Time Wizard: Default KDE (client, just like the others)</P>
<P>There is a difference between KDE screens at client and server: the client  
VL420 offers 'CD-ROM mounted at /mnt/cdrom' and 'Floppy mounted at 
/mnt/floppy' but server Vectra VL420 (having the same type of devices!) doesn't.
Besides that, if a flash storage is connected to a USB port, <EM>before</EM>
Linux being started, there will also appear an icon for it. Interestingly, at server 
there's no something like that. I consider, that is also a matter of the difference 
between the client and server types of Mandrake Linux installations, or maybe a
matter of some security measures for server-type installations. Whatever it is,
I see that as a shortage of confortable for Mandrake Linux servers. Case some
of you, the readers, has some workarounds on that issues, your contributions
are welcomed!</P>
<P>Besides that, KDE's Panel at client offers 'Mandrake Control Center - System 
configuration tool' (although useful only under root privileges), and KDE's Panel 
at server doesn't have that (in fact, an 'ordinary' user may access the same tool 
from the Start Applications menu and, again, to use it after the root's password 
entered). It makes me wonder why they at Mandrake did it like that. Maybe they
didn't want 'ordinary' users to access some configuration tools as easily ...</P>
<P>...</P>
<P>What about the Ctrl-Alt-Del:</P>
<P>- laptop: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do next?
Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer, OK and
Cancel buttons.</P>
<P>- client: a screen 'End Session for "username"' What do you want to do next?
Login as different user, Turn off computer, Restart computer, OK and
Cancel buttons.</P>
<P>- server: a screen 'End Session for "username"', Logout and Cancel buttons.</P>
<P>After choosing Login as different user what appeared were the same screen as 
described in 'The first Mandrake Linux boot screen' section.</P>
<P>Should you want to learn more about LILO (<B>Li</B>nux <B>Lo</B>ader), configured to
boot the systems in the examples above, you should refer to the
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html">LILO</A> mini-HOWTO.</P>
<P>There is also a difference between client and server behavior when it is about
to shutdown (halt) the system. A user is capable to halt the system even from
the login screen at client (that is not available at server). On the other hand,
a user has to know root password to halt the system at server.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="Linux+WinNT.html#toc7.3">General issues with the Mandrake 9.1 Linux installation</A>
</H2>

<P>A 'Network' bootable installation floppy should also be capable to reach
Mandrake installation files not only from NFS, FTP or HTTP servers, but
files that are copied to shared disks on machines within the local network. 
When an image is called a 'Network' image, that means, IMHO, all kinds of 
network locations should be accessible - NOT only those specific server-type 
locations like NFS, FTP or HTTP servers. In fact, if a user in a local
network doesn't have NFS, FTP or HTTP servers, but has the installation
packages copied somewhere else on the LAN, there should be a way to 
access those packages too.</P>
<P>The workstation-like installations do not offer a 'root' account to be used from
the graphical login window (I suppose that 'su' or 'sudo' actions are available 
- I haven't tested them yet). That might be a problem in cases when a user
misconfigures his/her account and when the administrator has to login to the 
system to fix that problem. At the moment, I am not sure how the administrator 
could do that without having the 'root' login ability (perhaps using virtual text 
consoles accessed with CTRL-ALT-F1, CTRL-ALT-F2 ... , then starting GUI 
if needed, etc ...)</P>

<P><B>Some issues <EM>after</EM> the Mandrake 9.1 Linux installation:</B></P>

<P>Talking about the behavior of Mandrake 9.1 - related to the type of installation 
(a workstation or a workstation/server combination) - it seems that there are 
some other differences. As already mentioned, on a workstation desktop there 
are icons for CD and FD drives (although maybe not already being 
<EM>mounted</EM> at the moment of the system boot). As well, if a USB flash 
storage is connected to the USB port, there is also an icon of an <EM>sda</EM>
(SCSI ?) USB storage available. On the other hand, in case of workstation/server 
installations - there are no icons of those devices at all. It seems that the server 
installation considers that is better to live without these devices in case of a 
server :-)  Any comments are welcomed.</P>

<P>Related to writing and testing HOWTO's. I prefer to write a 'HOWTO' document
using a text editor and make it with a <CODE>.sgml</CODE> extension. Then I use the old,
good <CODE>sgml2html</CODE> tool to make HTML pages, in order to check how these
pages will look like. Well, that's OK under Red Hat 7.1 but under Mandrake 9.1 it
seems that I am not able to find the same tool. Any idea on that task?</P>
