<P>This section's aim is to provide some information, not needed to reach
a basic understanding on how multicast works nor to be able to write
multicast programs, but which is very interesting, gives some insight on
the underlying multicast protocols and implementations, and may be useful to
avoid common errors and misunderstandings.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 IGMP.</A>
</H2>

<P>When talking about <CODE>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</CODE> and <CODE>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</CODE>,
we said that the information provided by this "commands" was used by the
kernel to choose which multicast datagrams accept or discard. This is true,
but it is not all the truth. Such a simplification would imply that
multicast datagrams for <EM>all</EM> multicast groups around the world
would be received by our host, and then it would check the memberships
issued by processes running on it to decide whether to pass the traffic to
them or to throw it out. As you can imagine, this is a complete bandwidth
waste.
<P>What actually happens is that hosts instruct their routers telling them
which multicast groups they are interested in; then, those routers
tell their up-stream routers they want to receive that traffic, and so 
on. Algorithms employed for making the decision of <EM>when</EM> to
ask for a group's traffic or saying that it is not desired anymore,
vary a lot. There's something, however, that never changes: <EM>how</EM>
this information is transmitted. <B>IGMP</B> is used for that. It stands for
Internet Group Management Protocol. It is a new protocol, similar in many
aspects to ICMP, with a protocol number of 2, whose messages are carried in
IP datagrams, and which all level 2-compliant host are required to implement. 
<P>As said before, it is used both by hosts giving membership information to
its routers, and by routers to communicate between themselves. In the
following I'll cover only the hosts-routers relationships, mainly because
I was unable to find information describing router to router communication
other than the mrouted source code (rfc 1075 describing the Distance Vector
Multicast Routing Protocol is now obsoleted, and <CODE>mrouted</CODE> implements
a modified DVMRP not yet documented).
<P>IGMP version 0 is specified in RFC-988 which is now obsoleted. Almost no one
uses version 0 now.
<P>IGMP version 1 is described in RFC-1112 and, although it is updated by RFC-2236
(IGMP version 2) it is in wide use still. The Linux kernel implements the full
IGMP version 1 and parts of version 2 requirements, but not all.
<P>Now I'll try to give an informal description of the protocol. You can check
RFC-2236 for an in-proof formal description, with lots of state diagrams
and time-out boundaries.
<P>All IGMP messages have the following structure:

<HR>
<P>IGMP version 1 (hereinafter IGMPv1) labels the "Max Resp Time" as "Unused",
zeroes it when sent, and ignores it when received. Also, it brakes 
the "Type" field in two 4-bits wide fields: "Version" and "Type". As IGMPv1
identifies a "Membership Query" message as 0x11 (version 1, type 1) and
IGMPv2 as 0x11 too, the 8 bits have the same effective interpretation.
<P>I think it is more instructive to give first the IGMPv1 description and next
point out the IGMPv2 additions, as they are mainly that, additions.
<P>For the following discussions it is important to remember that multicast
routers receive <EM>all</EM> IP multicast datagrams.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sect-IGMPv1"></A> IGMP version 1.</H3>

<P>Routers periodically send <EM>IGMP Host Membership Queries</EM> to the all-hosts
group (224.0.0.1) with a TTL of 1 (once every minute or two). All 
multicast-capable hosts hear them, 
but don't answer immediately to avoid an IGMP Host Membership Report storm. 
Instead, they start a random delay timer for each group they belong to 
<EM>on the interface</EM> they received the query. 
<P>Sooner or later, the timer expires in one of the hosts, and it sends an
IGMP <EM>Host Membership Report</EM> (also with TTL 1) to the multicast address of the 
group being reported. As it is sent to the group, all hosts that joined 
the group -and which are currently waiting for their own timer to expire-
receive it, too. Then, they stop their timers and don't generate any other
report. Just one is generated -by the host that chose the smaller timeout-,
and that is enough for the router. It only needs to know that there are
members for that group in the subnet, not how many nor which.
<P>When no reports are received for a given group after a certain number
of queries, the router assumes that no members are left, and thus it
doesn't have to forward traffic for that group on that subnet. Note that
in IGMPv1 there are no "Leave Group messages".
<P>When a host joins a <EM>new</EM> group, the kernel sends a report for that
group, so that the respective process needs not to wait a minute or two
until a new membership query is received. As you can see this IGMP packet
is generated by the kernel as a response to the <CODE>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</CODE>
command, seen in section 
<A HREF="Multicast-HOWTO-6.html#sect-ADD-MEMBERSHIP">IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</A>. 
Note the emphasis in the adjective "new": if a process issues an 
<CODE>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</CODE> command for a group the host is already a member of,
no IGMP packets are sent as we must already be receiving traffic for that
group; instead, a counter for that group's use is incremented.
<CODE>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</CODE> generates no datagrams in IGMPv1.
<P>Host Membership Queries are identified by Type 0x11, and Host Membership 
Reports by Type 0x12.
<P>No reports are sent for the all-hosts group. Membership in this group is
permanent.
<P>
<P>
<H3>IGMP version 2.</H3>

<P>One important addition to the above is the inclusion of a <EM>Leave
Group</EM> message (Type 0x17). The reason is to reduce the bandwidth
waste between the time the last host in the subnet drops membership and
the time the router times-out for its queries and decides there are no more 
members present for that group (leave latency). Leave Group messages should 
be addressed to
the all-routers group (224.0.0.2) rather than to the group being left, as that
information is of no use for other members (kernel versions up to 2.0.33
send them to the group; although it does no harm to the hosts, it's a waste
of time as they have to process them, but don't gain useful information). 
There are certain subtle details regarding when and when-not to send Leave 
Messages; if interested, see the RFC. 
<P>When an IGMPv2 router receives a Leave Message for a group, it sends
<EM>Group-Specific Queries</EM> to the group being left. This is another
addition. IGMPv1 has no group-specific queries. All queries are sent to the
all-hosts group. The Type in the IGMP header does not change (0x11, as
before), but the  "Group Address" is filled with the address of the
multicast group being left.
<P>The "Max Resp Time" field, which was set to 0 in transmission and ignored 
on reception in IGMPv1, is meaningful only
in "Membership Query" messages. It gives the maximum time allowed before
sending a report in units of 1/10 second. It is used as a tune mechanism.
<P>IGMPv2 adds another message type: 0x16. It is a "Version 2 Membership
Report" sent by IGMPv2 hosts if they detect an IGMPv2 router is present
(an IGMPv2 host knows an IGMPv1 router is present when it receives a query
with the "Max Response" field set to 0). 
<P>When more than one router claims to act as querier, IGMPv2 
provides a mechanism to avoid "discussions": the router with the lowest IP
address is designed to be querier. The other routers keep timeouts. If the router
with lower IP address crashes or is shutdown, the decision of who will be
the querier is taken again after the timers expire.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Kernel corner.</A>
</H2>

<P>This sub-section gives some start-points to study the multicast implementation
of the Linux kernel. It does not explain that implementation. It just says
where to find things.
<P>The study was carried over version 2.0.32, so it could be a bit outdated by
the time you read it (network code seems to have changed <EM>A LOT</EM> in
2.1.x releases, for instance).
<P>Multicast code in the Linux kernel is always surrounded by 
<CODE>#ifdef CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST</CODE> / <CODE>#endif</CODE> pairs, so that you can include/
exclude it from your kernel based on your needs (this inclusion/exclusion
is done at compile time, as you probably know if reading that section...
<CODE>#ifdef</CODE>s are handled by the preprocessor.  The decision is made based in 
what you selected when doing either a <CODE>make config</CODE>, <CODE>make menuconfig</CODE> or 
<CODE>make xconfig</CODE>).
<P>You might want multicast features, but if your Linux box is not going to
act as a multicast router you will probably not want multicast router features
included in your new kernel. For this you have the multicast routing code 
surrounded by <CODE>#ifdef CONFIG_IP_MROUTE</CODE> / <CODE>#endif</CODE> pairs.
<P>Kernel sources are usually placed in /usr/src/linux. However, the place
may change so, both for accuracy and brevity, I will refer to the
root directory of the kernel sources as just LINUX. Then, something like
<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/udp.c</CODE> should be the same as 
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/udp.c</CODE> if you unpacked the kernel 
sources in the <CODE>/usr/src/linux</CODE> directory.
<P>All multicast interfaces with user programs shown in the section devoted
to multicast programming were driven across the <CODE>setsockopt()</CODE>/
<CODE>getsockopt()</CODE>
system calls. Both of them are implemented by means of functions that
make some tests to verify the parameters passed to them and which, in turn,
call another function that makes some additional tests, demultiplexes the
call based on the <CODE>level</CODE> parameter to either system call, and then calls
another function which... (if interested in all this jumps, you can follow
them in <CODE>LINUX/net/socket.c</CODE> (functions <CODE>sys_socketcall()</CODE> and 
<CODE>sys_setsockopt()</CODE>,
<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/af_inet.c</CODE> (function <CODE>inet_setsockopt()</CODE>) and 
<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c</CODE> (function <CODE>ip_setsockopt()</CODE>) ).
<P>The one which interests us is <CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c</CODE>. Here we find
<CODE>ip_setsockopt()</CODE> and <CODE>ip_getsockopt()</CODE> which are mainly a 
<CODE>switch</CODE> (after some error checking) verifying each possible value for 
<CODE>optname</CODE>. Along with 
unicast options, all multicast ones seen here are handled: 
<CODE>IP_MULTICAST_TTL</CODE>, <CODE>IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</CODE>, <CODE>IP_MULTICAST_IF</CODE>, 
<CODE>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</CODE> and <CODE>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP</CODE>. Previously to the 
<CODE>switch</CODE>, a test is made to determine
whether the options are multicast router specific, and if so, they are
routed to the <CODE>ip_mroute_setsockopt()</CODE> and <CODE>ip_mroute_getsockopt()</CODE> 
functions (file <CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ipmr.c</CODE>).
<P>In <CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/af_inet.c</CODE> we can see the default values we talked about 
in previous sections (loopback enabled, TTL=1) provided when the socket is 
created (taken from function <CODE>inet_create()</CODE> in this file):
<HR>
<PRE>
 
#ifdef CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
        sk->ip_mc_loop=1;
        sk->ip_mc_ttl=1;
        *sk->ip_mc_name=0;
        sk->ip_mc_list=NULL;
#endif
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Also, the assertion of "closing a socket makes the kernel drop all memberships
this socket had" is corroborated by:
<HR>
<PRE>
#ifdef CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
                /* Applications forget to leave groups before exiting */
                ip_mc_drop_socket(sk);
#endif
</PRE>
<HR>

taken from <CODE>inet_release()</CODE>, on the same file as before.
<P>Device independent operations for the Link Layer are kept in 
<CODE>LINUX/net/core/dev_mcast.c</CODE>.
<P>Two important functions are still missing: the processing of input and
output multicast datagrams. As any other datagrams, incoming datagrams are
passed from the device drivers to the <CODE>ip_rcv()</CODE> function 
(<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ip_input.c</CODE>).
In this function is where the perfect filtering is applied to multicast
packets that crossed the devices layer (recall that lower layers only perform
best-effort filtering and is IP who 100% knows whether we are interested in
that multicast group or not). If the host is acting as a multicast router, this
function decides too whether the datagram should be forwarded and calls
<CODE>ipmr_forward()</CODE> appropriately. (<CODE>ipmr_forward()</CODE> is implemented in
<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ipmr.c</CODE>).
<P>Code in charge of out-putting packets is kept in 
<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ip_output.c</CODE>.
Here is where the <CODE>IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</CODE> option takes effect, as it is checked
to see whether to loop back the packets or not (function <CODE>ip_queue_xmit()</CODE>). 
Also the TTL of the outgoing
packet is selected based on whether it is a multicast or unicast one. In the
former case, the argument passed to the <CODE>IP_MULTICAST_TTL</CODE> option is used
(function (<CODE>ip_build_xmit()</CODE>).
<P>While working with <CODE>mrouted</CODE> (a program which gives the kernel information 
about how to route multicast datagrams), we detected that
all multicast packets originated on the local network were properly 
routed..., except the ones from the Linux box that was acting as the multicast
router!! ip_input.c was working OK, but it seemed ip_output.c wasn't. 
Reading the source code for the output functions, we found that
outgoing datagrams were not being passed to <CODE>ipmr_forward()</CODE>, the function
that had to decide whether they should be routed or not. The packets were
outputed to the local network but, as network cards are usually unable to
read their own transmissions, those datagrams were never routed. 
We added the necessary code to the <CODE>ip_build_xmit()</CODE> function and 
everything was OK again.  (Having
the sources for your kernel is not a luxury or pedantry; it's a need!)
<P><CODE>ipmr_forward()</CODE> has been mentioned a couple of times. It is an important
function as it solves one important misunderstanding that appears to be
widely expanded. When routing multicast traffic, it is <EM>not</EM> <CODE>mrouted</CODE>
who makes the copies and sends them to the proper recipients. <CODE>mrouted</CODE>
receives all multicast traffic and, based on that information, computes
the multicast routing tables and <EM>tells the kernel</EM> how to route: 
"datagrams for this group coming from that interface should be forwarded
to those interfaces". This information is passed to the kernel by calls
to <CODE>setsockopt()</CODE> on a raw socket opened by the <CODE>mrouted</CODE> daemon (the
protocol specified when the raw socket was created <EM>must</EM> be 
<CODE>IPPROTO_IGMP</CODE>). This
options are handled in the <CODE>ip_mroute_setsockopt()</CODE> function from
<CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ipmr.c</CODE>. The first option (would be better to call them
commands rather than options) issued on that socket must be <CODE>MRT_INIT</CODE>. 
All other commands are
ignored (returning <CODE>-EACCES</CODE>) if <CODE>MRT_INIT</CODE> is not issued first. Only one
instance of <CODE>mrouted</CODE> can be running at the same time in the same host.
To keep track of this, when the first <CODE>MRT_INIT</CODE> is received, an important
variable, <CODE>struct sock* mroute_socket</CODE>, is pointed to the socket <CODE>MRT_INIT</CODE> 
was received on. If <CODE>mroute_socket</CODE> is not null when attending an
<CODE>MRT_INIT</CODE> this means another mrouted is already running and <CODE>-EADDRINUSE</CODE>
is returned. All resting commands (<CODE>MRT_DONE</CODE>, <CODE>MRT_ADD_VIF</CODE>, 
<CODE>MRT_DEL_VIF</CODE>, <CODE>MRT_ADD_MFC</CODE>, <CODE>MRT_DEL_MFC</CODE> and <CODE>MRT_ASSERT</CODE>) 
return <CODE>-EACCES</CODE> if they come from a socket different than 
<CODE>mroute_socket</CODE>.
<P>As routed multicast datagrams can be received/sent across either physical 
interfaces or tunnels, a common abstraction for both was devised: VIFs,
Virtual InterFaces. <CODE>mrouted</CODE> passes vif structures to the kernel, 
indicating physical
or tunnel interfaces to add to its routing tables, and multicast forwarding
entries saying where to forward datagrams.
<P>VIFs are added with <CODE>MRT_ADD_VIF</CODE> and deleted with <CODE>MRT_DEL_VIF</CODE>. Both
pass a <CODE>struct vifctl</CODE> to the kernel (defined in 
<CODE>/usr/include/linux/mroute.h</CODE>) with the following information:
<HR>
<PRE>
struct vifctl {
        vifi_t  vifc_vifi;              /* Index of VIF */
        unsigned char vifc_flags;       /* VIFF_ flags */
        unsigned char vifc_threshold;   /* ttl limit */
        unsigned int vifc_rate_limit;   /* Rate limiter values (NI) */
        struct in_addr vifc_lcl_addr;   /* Our address */
        struct in_addr vifc_rmt_addr;   /* IPIP tunnel addr */
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>With this information a <CODE>vif_device</CODE> structure is built:
<HR>
<PRE>
struct vif_device
{
        struct device   *dev;                   /* Device we are using */
        struct route    *rt_cache;              /* Tunnel route cache */
        unsigned long   bytes_in,bytes_out;
        unsigned long   pkt_in,pkt_out;         /* Statistics */
        unsigned long   rate_limit;             /* Traffic shaping (NI) */
        unsigned char   threshold;              /* TTL threshold */
        unsigned short  flags;                  /* Control flags */
        unsigned long   local,remote;           /* Addresses(remote for tunnels)*/
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Note the <CODE>dev</CODE> entry in the structure. The <CODE>device</CODE> structure is 
defined in <CODE>/usr/include/linux/netdevice.h</CODE> file. It is a big structure,
but the field that interests us is:
<HR>
<PRE>
  struct ip_mc_list*    ip_mc_list;   /* IP multicast filter chain    */
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The <CODE>ip_mc_list</CODE> structure -defined in <CODE>/usr/include/linux/igmp.h</CODE>-
is as follows:
<HR>
<PRE>
struct ip_mc_list
{
        struct device *interface;
        unsigned long multiaddr;

        int users;
};
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>So, the <CODE>ip_mc_list</CODE> member from the <CODE>dev</CODE> structure is a pointer to a linked
list of <CODE>ip_mc_list</CODE> structures, each containing an entry for each multicast
group the network interface is a member of. Here again we see membership is
associated to interfaces. <CODE>LINUX/net/ipv4/ip_input.c</CODE> traverses this
linked list to decide whether the received datagram is destined to any group 
the interface that received the datagram belongs to:

<HR>
<P>The <CODE>users</CODE> field in the <CODE>ip_mc_list</CODE> structure is used to implement

that same group in that same interface before) only the count of members

<P>With all this information in hand, <CODE>ipmr_forward()</CODE> "walks" across the VIFs,

to be sent across a tunnel (ie, the unicast destination address of the 
other end of the tunnel).
<P>Function <CODE>ip_rt_event()</CODE> (not directly related to output, but which is
