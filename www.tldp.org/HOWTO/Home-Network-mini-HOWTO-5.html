<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Problems</A> </H2>

<P>There are lots and lots of things which can go wrong using a simple document
like this, because there are plenty of special cases. The majority of possible
problems adhere to the configuration of the internal and external network devices.
I will try and respond to people with problems, figure out what went wrong
and add links down here so that people with special case problems can track
down help. Feel free to contact me at

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 ICQ Does Not Work</A>
 </H2>

<P>Some portions of ICQ work fine over masquerading. Other portions do not
work well at all. There is a 
<A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/djsf/masq-icq/">beta quality ICQ module</A> under development, however, which addresses some
(but not all) of the deficiencies of running ICQ over masquerading. The <CODE>README</CODE>
file in the source code distribution describes how to compile the module. Once
you have it compiled and installed, invoke <CODE>/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_icq</CODE>.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 I Have Caldera 2.X Not Red Hat 6.X</A>
 </H2>

<P>Well, firstly congratulations for bucking the trend! Secondly, Nelson Gibbs
(ngibbs@pacbell.net) sends good news, because most of these instructions will
work for you. There are some important changes to note however:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>A <CODE>GATEWAY=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</CODE> statement in <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</CODE>
&amp; <CODE>eth1</CODE> for the interface (local interface uses remote interface IP address
and remote interface uses service provider's gateway IP).</LI>
<LI>Make sure <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/daemons/dhcpd</CODE> script lists <CODE>ROUTE_DEVICE</CODE> as <CODE>eth1</CODE>
<EM>not</EM> <CODE>eth0</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>/etc/dhcpd.conf</CODE> requires a subnet statement for both interfaces (I'm not
entirely sure why as I made my second statement : subnet 216.102.154.201 netmask
255.255.255.255 { } with no other options and the DHCP server listens
and sends on eth0 and eth1 as well as the fallback). The DHCP server errors
out if only one subnet is listed.</LI>
<LI>Do <EM>not</EM> add host route <CODE>255.255.255.255</CODE>, the <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd</CODE> script
Caldera uses already fixes the problem. <EM>DO</EM> make sure to change all references
to <CODE>eth0</CODE> in the script to <CODE>eth1</CODE>.</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 I Want One of My Internal Machines to be my Web Server</A>
 </H2>

<P>Piece of cake! However, <EM>you need to have a static IP address</EM> for this easy
set of directions to work. If you have a dynamic IP address, you will need
some additional scripting to ensure that your IP address gets updated in the
port forwarding commands when the address changes.
<P>Bear in mind, forwarding an external port to an inside machine makes your
"internal" machine less "internal" than before, but it can be done very transparently
and with little or no performance degredation. One of the side effects of the
IP masquerading code in the Linux kernel is the ability to do some pretty funky
stuff with packets as they hit the network layer, and the <CODE>ipmasqadm</CODE> utility
is built to take advantage of that.
<P>For some reason <CODE>ipmasqadm</CODE> is not shipped with all the Red Hat and Mandrake
variants, so will probably have to retrieve it from the maintainer's 
<A HREF="http://juanjox.kernelnotes.org">web site</A> -- there
is an 
<A HREF="http://juanjox.kernelnotes.org/ipmasqadm-0.4.2-2.i386.rpm">RPM</A> available there as well as source code.
<P>Once you have the RPM, install it, and then add the following lines to
your <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE> file:
<P>
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -f 
/usr/sbin/ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L x.x.x.x 80 -R 192.168.1.x 80 
 
</PRE>
<P>The first command flushes the port forwarding rules and the second command
adds a forward from port 80 on the external interface to port 80 on the internal
machine. Note that the external static IP address goes in the x.x.x.x space
and the internal machine IP address goes in the 192.168.1.x space.
<P>Now external requests for port 80 will be transparently sent to port 80
of the internal machine. Note that you cannot test this by telnetting or connecting
to your gateway's port 80 from one of your inside machine: the port forwarder
only honors requests coming in on the <EM>external</EM> interface.
