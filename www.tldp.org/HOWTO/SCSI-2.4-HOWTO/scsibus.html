>SCSI. </B
>
The original SCSI 1 standard (ANSI specification X3.131-1986) introduced
an 8 bit parallel bus that was able to do asynchronous transfers at 1.5
MegaBytes/sec and synchronous transfers up to 5 MB/sec. SCSI commands are
sent at the asynchronous rate. SCSI data is transferred either at the
asynchronous rate (worst case) or a negotiated synchronous rate (with
5 MB/sec being the best case).
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>FAST SCSI. </B
>
The SCSI 2 standard raised the maximum synchronous speed to 10 MB/sec. SCSI 2
defined several parallel buses: single ended (as used by SCSI 1) and a new
differential bus. The differential bus has better noise immunity and its
maximum bus length is 25 metres (compared with single ended's 6 metres).
Tagged queuing of commands was also added by SCSI 2.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>WIDE SCSI. </B
>
The SCSI 2 standard also increased the width of the bus allowing 16 and 32 bit
"wide" variants. Very little use has been made of the 32 bit width so "wide"
usually refers to a 16 bit wide data path. The maximum number of SCSI devices
that can connect to a parallel SCSI bus is directly related to the bus width
hence "wide" buses allow a maximum of 16 SCSI devices to be connected.
[At least one of those devices must be the SCSI "initiator" which is
usually a host adapter.]
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>ULTRA SCSI. </B
>
Traditionally synchronous buses are clocked either on the rising or falling
edge of the clock (which is normally a square wave). A recent trend has been
to clock on both edges and thus double the available bandwidth. This is
how ULTRA SCSI doubles the SCSI 2 "fast" speed to 20 MB/sec.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>ULTRA WIDE SCSI. </B
>
The same "ultra" technique applied to a (16 bit) wide SCSI parallel bus yields
a bandwidth of 40 MB/sec.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>ULTRA 2 WIDE SCSI. </B
>
This variant introduces a new "low voltage" differential signalling (LVD) that
allows the synchronous clock speed to be doubled yielding 80 MB/sec when using
a (16 bit) wide bus. In this case the maximum SCSI bus length is 12 metres. To
be backward compatible with ULTRA WIDE this variant can fall back to "single
ended" operation. This leads to the abbreviation LVD/SE being used by adapter
manufacturers. One shortcoming of this approach is that the presence of one
UW device on a U2W bus will cause all other U2W devices to communicate at
the slower (i.e. UW) rate. Some adapters overcome this by having separate
LVD and SE physical buses on the same logical SCSI bus.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>ULTRA 160 SCSI. </B
>
ULTRA 160 doubles parallel SCSI bus bandwidth yet again. It uses a 16 bit
wide data path, LVD signalling (see previous entry) and double transition
clocking that increases the maximum synchronous bandwidth to 160 MB/sec.
Additional features include cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) to improve data
integrity (compared with a parity bit) and domain validation which adjusts
transfer rates if the error rate is too high.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>ULTRA 320 SCSI. </B
>
Shortly ULTRA 320 adapters will be available (disks with that interface
are already on the market). This is also a 16 bit wide LVD bus that can
fall back to slower speeds for compatibility with older devices. It extends
the features of Ultra 160 by doubling the clock speed. Packetized SCSI
which sends commands and status at full bus speed (rather than 5 MB/sec)
is included. Other improvements include "quick arbitration and selection",
"read and write data streaming" and CRC protection for command blocks as well
as data (Ultra 160 had CRC protection for data only). Note that adapter
cards using 64 bit PCI (or better: PCI-X) are required to stop the PCI bus
being a bottleneck at these speeds. More information can be found at

Recently an Ultra 320 HBA vendor claimed up to 105,000 IO operations 
per second which implies per command SCSI bus overhead is less than 10
microseconds. There is a draft ULTRA 640 standard but that may be overtaken 
by Serial Attached SCSI.

>Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). </B
>
Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) uses the same transport technology as Serial
ATA (sATA) and extends it. [sATA is described below.] SAS can use external 
expanders to control up to 16000 devices from a single HBA. The data 
transfer is full duplex and 1.5 Gbps or 3.0 Gbps "phys"s can be aggregated 
to increase bandwidth. Cable lengths can be up to 6 meters. SAS disks are 
dual ported. sATA disks can be connected to a SAS expanders (but SAS disks
can't be connected to a sATA HBA). SAS was demonstrated at CeBit recently
but won't reach the market until 2004.

>FC-AL. </B
>
This stands for Fibre Channel - Arbitrated Loop and may involve dual
2 Gigabit per second single mode fibre optic links spanning 10 
kilometres with throughput of up to 400 MegaBytes per second.
Often associated with storage area networks (SANs). Up to 126
devices can be attached to a loop which in turn can be extended
to 16 million devices in public loop mode. The transmission medium
isn't necessarily fibre optic cable: copper (in the form of co-axial
cable) can also be used at lower speeds and for shorter distances.

This standard also goes by the name of "Fire Wire" [trademarked
by Apple] and "iLink" [trademarked by Sony]. It is a serial bus that can run
at up to 400 Megabits/sec (IEEE 1394a). A newer standard, IEEE 1394b, ups
this to 800 Megabits/sec (with extensions to 1.6 and 3.2 Gigabits/sec) with
cable runs up to 100 metres. It has a similar but more general architecture
than USB. The IEEE 1394 standard allows for the SCSI command set to be
carried over a 1394 bus. There is a "sbp2" driver now available for
the Linux IEEE 1394 stack. This sbp2 driver is also a SCSI subsystem
lower level driver (so it is functionally similar to the ide-scsi driver).
So IEEE 1394 devices that use the SBP-2 protocol (e.g. disks, cd-rw/dvd
drives, MO drives and scanners) can be accessed via the SCSI subsystem.

>iSCSI. </B

This is a new IETF standard for sending the SCSI command set over a
TCP connection (or several of them). This permits SCSI devices (targets
such as disks) to be network appliances, accessed locally (or potentially
at a great distance) by a host machine.

The following buses are not defined by the SCSI standards but are of interest
because they either can carry the SCSI command set, are in some way
related to the Linux SCSI subsystem or supply a similar functionality to
SCSI products.

>IDE/ATA (ATAPI). </B
>
IDE is the most used disk type on PC systems today. The acronym stands for
Integrated Drive Electronics and as the name suggests it places the bulk
of the IO "intelligence" on the disk controller card rather than spreading
it between the device (most often a disk) and a controller (HBA) as SCSI
does. IDE grew out of the ST506 and ESDI standards in the 1980s. EIDE
(extended IDE) is a related acronym. The modern standards that refer to
this bus architecture are known as ATA and can be found at 
<A
HREF="http://www.t13.org"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;<TT
CLASS="literal"
>www.t13.org</TT
></A
>. The ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI)
extends the disk oriented command set to support CDROM and tape drives.
The ATAPI command set closely resembles the SCSI command set. The
most recent ATA technology is outlined in the next paragraph.
</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>ATA 133. </B
>
The ATA standards used by IDE devices have also been marching through
the adjectives (e.g. fast and ultra) and the numbers (e.g. 2, 33,
66, 100 and 133). The most recent addition is ATA 133 which supports
burst rates of 133 MB/sec and up to 2 devices per bus. [PCs typically
have 2 and often 4 ATA buses.] ATA 66, 100 and 133 need a special cable.
ATA cables are relatively short precluding IDE devices being external to
the computer. Cable lengths have previously been limited to 18 inches
although 1 metre long cables have now appeared. Coincidently 133 MB/sec
in also the maximum throughput of the normal PCI bus found in most
PCs. The are higher speed (and wider) versions of PCI but they are
relatively rare.

>Serial ATA (sATA). </B
>
Serial ATA uses 2 differential pairs to exchange data with a sATA
disk less than 1 metre away at 1.5 Gigabits per second. One pair takes data
to the disk and the other returns data from the disk. Data rates up to
150 Megabytes per second are possible (data transfer is half duplex).
sATA is a point to point connection, not a bus, so ATA's master and slave
strapping disappears. sATA cabling is less bulky and the form factor of
its plugs and sockets are smaller than parallel ATA (and the SCSI Parallel
interface). sATA devices are beginning to appear on the market. sATA-2
is a draft standard that doubles the serial data rate to 3 Gigabits per
second.

>USB. </B
>
Universal Serial Bus (USB) has a bandwidth of between 1.5 and 12
Megabits/sec (the latter speed with USB 1.1). Up to 127 devices can
be connected using a series of hubs each of which connects up to 7
devices (with a 5 metre limit). USB supplies 5 volts at 0.5 amps to
power small devices. USB is "plug and play", hot pluggable and supports
isochronous data transfers (required for audio and video devices that
need guaranteed minimum bandwidth).
</P

><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"

><B
>PC Parallel port. </B
>
The original PC parallel port was uni-directional (towards the printer)
and was capable of about 10 KB/sec. The IEEE 1284 standard in 1994
introduced 5 modes of data transfer:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Compatibility mode (forward direction)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Nibble mode (reverse direction)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Byte mode (reverse direction)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>EPP mode (bi-directional)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>ECP mode (bi-directional)</P
></LI
></UL
>
Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) achieves transfer speeds of between 500 KB/sec
and 2 MB/sec and is targeted at CD-ROMs, tapes and hard drives. Extended
Capability Port (ECP) includes run length encoding and support for DMA.
ECP is targeted at fast printers and scanners.

>I2O. </B
>
"The I2O (Intelligent Input/Output) specification defines a standard
architecture for intelligent I/O that is independent of both the specific
device being controlled and the host operating system (OS)" [from <A
HREF="http://www.i2osig.org"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="literal"
>www.i2osig.org</TT
></A
>].
It defines a "split driver" model in which the OS Services Module (OSM)
sits between the host OS device interface and the I2O communications layer
while the Hardware Device Module (HDM) sits between the I2O
communications layer and the hardware. The HDM may well run on a
dedicated processor (IOP).
