<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Boot Arguments for Video Frame Buffer Drivers</A></H2>

<P>The `video=' argument (not avail. in v2.0 kernels)
is used when the frame buffer device abstraction layer
is built into the kernel. If that sounds complicated,
well it isn't really too bad.  It basically means that 
instead of having a different
video program (the X11R6 server) for each brand of video
card (e.g. XF86_S3, XF86_SVGA, ...), the kernel would have 
a built in driver available for each video card and export 
a single interface for the video program so that only one
X11R6 server (XF86_FBDev) would be required.  This is similar
to how networking is now - the kernel has drivers available for
each brand of network card and exports a single network 
interface so that just one version of a network program
(like Netscape) will work for all systems, regardless of the
underlying brand of network card.
<P>The typical format of this argument is 
<CODE>video=name:option1,option2,...</CODE>
where <CODE>name</CODE> is the name of a generic option or of a
frame buffer driver.
The <CODE>video=</CODE> option is passed from <CODE>linux/init/main.c</CODE>
into <CODE>linux/drivers/video/fbmem.c</CODE> for further processing.
Here it is checked for some generic options before trying to 
match to a known driver name. Once a driver name match is made,
the comma separated option list is then passed into that particular
driver for final processing. The list of valid driver names
can be found by reading down the <CODE>fb_drivers</CODE> array in the
file <CODE>fbmem.c</CODE> mentioned above.
<P>Information on the options that each driver supports will
eventually be found in <CODE>linux/Documentation/fb/</CODE> but 
currently (v2.2) only a few are described there.  
Unfortunately the number
of video drivers and the number of options for each one 
is content for another document itself and hence 
too much to list here.
<P>If there is no Documentation file for your card, you 
will have to get
the option information directly from the driver. Go to
<CODE>linux/drivers/video/</CODE> and look in the appropriate
<CODE>???fb.c</CODE> file (the ??? will be based on the card name).
In there, search for a function with <CODE>_setup</CODE> in its name
and you should see what options the driver tries to match, 
such as <CODE>font</CODE> or <CODE>mode</CODE> or...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 The `video=map:...' Argument</A>
</H2>

<P>This option is used to set/override the console to frame buffer
device mapping. A comma separated list of numbers sets the mapping,
with the value of option N taken to be the frame buffer device 
number for console N.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 The `video=scrollback:...' Argument</A>
</H2>

<P>A number after the colon will set the size of memory allocated 
for the scrollback buffer. (Use Shift and Page Up or Page Down 
keys to scroll.)  A suffix of `k' or `K' after the number will 
indicate that the number is to be interpreted as kilobytes 
instead of bytes.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 The `video=vc:...' Argument</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>A number, or a range of numbers (e.g. <CODE>video=vc:2-5</CODE>)
will specify the first, or the first and last frame
buffer virtual console(s). The use of this option also 
has the effect of setting the frame buffer console to
<EM>not</EM> be the default console.
