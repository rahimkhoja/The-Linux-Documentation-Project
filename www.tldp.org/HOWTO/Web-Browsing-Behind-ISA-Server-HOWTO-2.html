</H2>

<P>ISA Server provides many important networking functions that include Firewalling,
Web-cache, Policy-based Administration, Dynamic IP Filtering, VPN Support, Intrusion
Detection, NAT and reporting. While being a robust solution for Windows-based clients,
its a pain for Linux users because most of the Linux-based browsers do not
appear to be working behind it. The term 'appear to be' is used because there are some
known workouts for this.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Why doesn't it work?</A>
</H2>

<P>While running Windows-based clients behind ISA Server, have you noticed that normally
you could browse using only Internet Explorer, and not using other browsers like 
Netscape? This is because ISA server uses an authentication mechanism it 
calls 'Integrated Authentication.' When Internet Explorer contacts ISA server to 
request a page, along with every request it sends a hash that the server uses to 
authenticate you as a legitimate domain user [You can verify this fact by sniffing 
some packets while you  browse, just check the request header that your browser 
sends to the ISA server]. This authentication method is not supported by other 
browsers, which is why it renders most of the browsers useless. 
<P>The following sections will tell you about two methods to enable your Linux-based 
browser to browse the net.
