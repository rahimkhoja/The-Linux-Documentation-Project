>&#13;	When a hard drive is partitioned, it is mapped into sections, but
	the sections are empty. It is like a newly constructed library;
	shelves, signs, and a card catalogue system must be put in place
	before the books are put away.</P
><P
>&#13;	The organizational structure inside a partition is called a file
	system. With Linux, the standard file system is ext2 and ext3. The
	ext3 file system is ext2, plus a log of disk writes called a
	journal. The journal allows the system to recover quickly from
	accidental power outages, among other things.
</P
><P
>&#13;	The principal tool for making an ext2/3 file system in a partition
	is <B
CLASS="command"
>mke2fs</B
>. It is usually found in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/sbin</TT
>. <B
CLASS="command"
>mkfs.ext2</B
> and
	<B
CLASS="command"
>mkfs.ext3</B
> are frontends which pass specific
	options to <B
CLASS="command"
>mke2fs</B
>.

>&#13;	The -m option is probably the one of most use to non-experts. If the
	file system becomes filled and there is no more space to write, it
	is basically unusable because the operating system is constantly
	writing to disk. By default, five percent of the partition is
	reserved for use by the root user. This allows root to conduct
	administrative activities on the partition and perhaps move some
	data off. However, this is most critical when the partition contains
	/ or home directories. For pure data partitions, this is just lost
	space. Five percent of a 250Gb partition is 12.5 Gb. Especially in
	the case of large partitions, it is safe to set the reserved space
	to the minimum, which is one percent.

>&#13;	creates a file system with only 1% of its space reserved for the
	root user. tune2fs -m can be used to adjust the reserved blocks
	after data is loaded on the partition.
