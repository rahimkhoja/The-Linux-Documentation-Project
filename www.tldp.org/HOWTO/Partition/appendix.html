>10.4. Some facts about file systems and fragmentation</H2
><P
>&#13;Disk space is administered by the operating system in units of
blocks and fragments of blocks. In ext2, fragments and blocks
have to be of the same size, so we can limit our discussion to
blocks.
</P
><P
>&#13;Files come in any size. They don't end on block boundaries.  So
with every file a part of the last block of every file is
wasted. Assuming that file sizes are random, there is
approximately a half block of waste for each file on your disk.
Tanenbaum calls this "internal fragmentation" in his book
"Operating Systems".
</P
><P
>&#13;You can guess the number of files on your disk by the number of
allocated inodes on a disk. On my disk

	there are about 12000 files on <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/</TT
> and about 44000 files on <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
>.  At a block size of 1 KB, about
	6+22 = 28 MB of disk space are lost in the tail blocks of files. Had
	I chosen a block size of 4 KB, I had lost 4 times this space.
</P
><P
>&#13;	Data transfer is faster for large contiguous chunks of data, though.
	That's why ext2 tries to preallocate space in units of 8 contigous
	blocks for growing files. Unused preallocation is released when the
	file is closed, so no space is wasted.
</P
><P
>&#13;	Noncontiguous placement of blocks in a file is bad for performance,
	since files are often accessed in a sequential manner. It forces the
	operating system to split a disk access and the disk to move the
	head. This is called "external fragmentation" or simply
	"fragmentation" and is a common problem with MS-DOS file systems. In
	conjunction with the abysmal buffer cache used by MS-DOS, the
	effects of file fragmentation on performance are very noticeable.
	DOS users are accustomed to defragging their disks every few weeks
	and some have even developed some ritualistic beliefs regarding
	defragmentation.
</P
><P
>&#13;	None of these habits should be carried over to Linux and ext2. Linux
	native file systems do not need defragmentation under normal use and
	this includes any condition with at least 5% of free space on a
	disk. There is a defragmentation tool for ext2 called defrag, but
	users are cautioned against casual use. A power outage during such
	an operation can trash your file system. Since you need to back up
	your data anyway, simply writing back from your copy will do the
	job.
</P
><P
>&#13;	The MS-DOS file system is also known to lose large amounts of disk
	space due to internal fragmentation. For partitions larger than 256
	MB, DOS block sizes grow so large that they are no longer useful
	(This has been corrected to some extent with FAT32). Ext2 does not
	force you to choose large blocks for large file systems, except for
	very large file systems in the 0.5 TB range (that's terabytes with 1
	TB equaling 1024 GB) and above, where small block sizes become
	inefficient. So unlike DOS there is no need to split up large disks
	into multiple partitions to keep block size down.
</P
><P
>&#13;	Use a 1Kb block size if you have many small files. For large
	partitions, 4Kb blocks are fine.
