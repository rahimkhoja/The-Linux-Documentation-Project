><P
>With ext2, partitioning decisions should be governed by backup
considerations and to avoid external fragmentation <A
HREF="appendix.html#fragmentation"

from different file lifetimes.
</P
><P
>Files have lifetimes. After a file has been created, it will
remain some time on the system and then be removed. File
lifetime varies greatly throughout the system and is partly
dependent on the pathname of the file. For example, files in
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/sbin</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/sbin</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/bin</TT
> and similar directories are
likely to have a very long lifetime: many months and above.
Files in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
> are likely to have a medium lifetime: several
weeks or so. File in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
> are usually short lived: Almost no
file in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/spool/news</TT
> will remain longer than a few days,
files in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/spool/lpd</TT
> measure their lifetime in minutes or
less.
</P
><P
>&#13;	For backup it is useful if the amount of daily backup is smaller
	than the capacity of a single backup medium. A daily backup can be a
	complete backup or an incremental backup.
</P
><P
>&#13;	You can decide to keep your partition sizes small enough that they
	fit completely onto one backup medium (choose daily full backups).
	In any case a partition should be small enough that its daily delta
	(all modified files) fits onto one backup medium (choose incremental
	backup and expect to change backup media for the weekly/monthly full
	dump - no unattended operation possible).
</P
><P
>&#13;	Your backup strategy depends on that decision.
</P
><P
>&#13;	When planning and buying disk space, remember to set aside a
	sufficient amount of money for backup! Unbackuped data is worthless!
	Data reproduction costs are much higher than backup costs for
	virtually everyone!
</P
><P
>&#13;	For performance it is useful to keep files of different lifetimes on
	different partitions. This way the short lived files on the news
	partition may be fragmented very heavily. This has no impact on the
	performance of the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/</TT
> or
	<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT

>4.4.1. How large should my swap space be?</H3
><P
>&#13;Conventional wisdom creates swap space equal to the amount of RAM. </P
><P
>&#13;	But keep in mind that this is just a rule of thumb. It is easily
	possible to create scenarios where programs have extremely large or
	extremely small working sets (see <A
HREF="partition-types.html#swap-partitions"
>Section 3.5</A
>). 
	For example, a simulation program with
	a large data set that is accessed in a very random fashion would
	have almost no noticeable locality of reference in its data segment,
	so its working set would be quite large.
</P
><P
>&#13;	On the other hand, a graphics program with many simultaneously
	opened JPEGs, all but one iconified, would have a very large data
	segment. But image transformations are all done on one single image,
	most of the memory occupied by the program is not accessed. The same
	is true for an editor with many editor windows where only one window
	is being modified at a time. These programs have - if they are
	designed properly - a very high locality of reference and large
	parts of them can be kept swapped out without too severe performance
	impact. A user who never never quits programs once launched would
	want a lot of swap space for the same reason.
</P
><P
>&#13;	Servers typically are configured with more swap space than their
	desktop counterparts. Even though a given amount of swap is
	sufficient for its operations, the server might come under transient
	heavy loads which cause it to page out at a high rate. Some
	administrators prefer this to the server crashing altogether. In
	these cases, swap might be several times the size of ram.

>4.4.2. How large <EM

><P
>&#13;		Currently, the maximum size of a swap partition is
		architecture-dependent. For i386, m68k, ARM and PowerPC, it is
		"officially" 2Gb. It is 128Gb on alpha, 1Gb on sparc, and 3Tb on
		sparc64. An opteron on the 2.6 kernel can write to a 16 Tb swap
		partition. For linux kernels 2.1 and earlier, the limit is
		128Mb. The partition may be larger than 128 MB, but excess space
		is never used. If you want more than 128 MB of swap for a 2.1
		and earlier kernel, you have to create multiple swap partitions
		(8 max). After 2.4, 32 swap areas are "officially" possible. See
		setting up swap for details.
</P
><P
><EM
>footnote:</EM
> 
	"official" max swap size: With kernel 2.4, the limit is 64 swap spaces at a
	maximum of 64Gb each, although this is not reflected in the man page
	for <B
CLASS="command"
>mkswap</B
>. With the 64 bit opteron on the 2.6 kernel, 128 swap
	areas are permitted, each a whopping 16 Tb! (thanks to Peter Chubb

	Here are the considerations:
</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;		If you have a disk with many heads and one with less heads and
		both are identical in other parameters, the disk with many heads
		will be faster. Reading data from different heads is fast, since
		it is purely electronic. Reading data from different tracks is
		slow, since it involves physically moving the head.
	</P
><P
>&#13;		It follows then that writing swap on a separate drive will be
		faster than moving the head back and forth on a single drive.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Placement</EM
>: 
		Older disks have the same number of sectors on all tracks. With
		these disks it will be fastest to put your swap in the middle of
		the disks, assuming that your disk head will move from a random
		track towards the swap area.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> 
		Newer disks use ZBR (zone bit recording). They have more sectors
		on the outer tracks. With a constant number of rpms, this yields
		a far greater performance on the outer tracks than on the inner
		ones. Put your swap on the fast tracks. (In general,
		low-numbered cylinders are associated low partition numbers.
		However, see Kristian's more recent <A
HREF="http://lissot.net/partition/mapping.html"
TARGET="_top"
>comments</A
>
		on this issue. -Tony)
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> <EM
>Usage</EM
>: 
		Of course your disk head will not move randomly. If you have swap
		space in the middle of a disk between a constantly busy home
		partition and an almost unused archive partition, you would be
		better of if your swap were near the home partition for
		even shorter head movements. You would be even better off, if you
		had your swap on another otherwise unused disk, though.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> <EM
>Striping</EM
>: 
		Speed can be increased by writing to multiple swap areas
		simultaneously. Swap spaces with the same priority will be
		written to like a RAID. See <A
HREF="setting_up_swap.html#multiple_swap_areas"
>Section 9.3</A
>.
</P
></LI
></UL
><P
><EM
>Summary:</EM
> 
	Put your swap on a fast disk with many heads that is not busy doing
	other things. If you have multiple disks: Split swap and scatter it
	over all your disks or even different controllers.
