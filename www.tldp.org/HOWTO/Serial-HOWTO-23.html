<H2><A NAME="ss23.1">23.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc23.1">Replacing pre 1990 UARTS</A>
</H2>

<P> Many 486 PCs (old) and all Pentiums (or the like) should have
modern 16550As (usually called just 16550's) with FIFOs.  If you have
something really old (pre 1990), the chip may unplug so that you may
be able to upgrade by finding a plug-in 16550A chip and replacing your
old existing 16450 UART.  If the functionality has been built into
another type of chip, you are out of luck.  If the UART is socketed,
then upgrading would be easy if you could find a replacement.  The new
and old are pin-to-pin compatible.  It may be more feasible to just
buy a new serial card on the Internet (few retail stores stock them
as of 2000) or find a used one.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss23.2">23.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc23.2">Two Ports with the Same IO address</A>
</H2>

<P>Modern kernels should not allow the opening of ports with the same
IO address.  But one may probe for ports even though they are not
open.  If two ports have the same IO address then old fashioned
probing by sending commands to the address  will erroneously indicate
only one port.  But modem device detection at boot-time should
discover both ports and report the conflict.  In olden days, all sorts
of errors were reported/observed for devices illegally attempting to
use the same IO address.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-11.html#probing_ss">Probing</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss23.3">23.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc23.3">Configuring by modifying source code</A>
</H2>

<P>In the past, to get a certain serial port supported, one might need
to modify the C source code, perhaps by adding a #define to it.
Today, the use of parameters for modules or the kernel, or the use of
configuration options should handle all cases (except possible for
antique hardware ??).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss23.4">23.4</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc23.4">Modems on Multiport Cards Obsolete for Sending at 56k</A>
</H2>

<P>For a modem to transmit at nearly 56k requires that it be a special
digital modem and have a digital connection to a digital phone line
(such as a T1 line).  Modems used with serial cards (the modems may
either be on the serial card or on another card) normally have no such
digital connection so they can't be used at the 56k speed, and thus
are obsolete unless one doesn't need to send at 56k.  In other words
they are obsolete for ISP servers but might be OK for small business
or home use.</P>
<P>A partial exception to the above are modem banks that connect to
multiport serial cards where the modem bank can access multiplexed
digital phone lines.   Thus one could use a multiport serial card with
a few 56k digital modems for sending at 56k.  For both analog and
digital modems there is one modem on each serial port so there needs
to be an external cable (modem bank to multiport) for each modem.
This can lead to a large number of cables.  So it's less clutter (and
cheaper) to use internal modems without a multiport card.  This makes
even this "exception" obsolete for high volume work.  It's somewhat
analogous to the lower cost of an internal modem for a desktop PC as
compared to the higher cost (and more cabling) for an external modem.

<H2><A NAME="ss23.5">23.5</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc23.5">Lock-Files if you used the depreciated devfs</A>
</H2>

<P> The abandoned device-filesystem (devfs) has the /dev directory
with subdirectories.  As of late 2001, there were problems with
lockfiles.  For example, the lockfile mechanism considered
dev/usb/tts/0 and /dev/tts/0 to be the same device with name "0".
Ditto for all other devices that had the same "leaf" name.  Also, if
some applications use the old name for a device and other applications
use the devfs name for the same  device, then the lockfiles will have
different names.  But the serial driver should know they are the same.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss23.6">23.6</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc23.6">Devfs (The deprecated Device File System.  History)</A>
</H2>

<P>Kernel 2.4 introduced the now obsolete optional "device file system"
(devfs) with a whole new set of names for everything.  Some people
used it but the majority probably didn't.  But in 2003-4, it was
claimed that devfs had unsolvable problems and starting with kernel
2.6.12 it was replaced with "udev" (kernels prior to 2.6.12 also could
use udev but with some problems).  Although udev doesn't provide all
the functionality of devfs, it does handle hot plugging.  Also, the
use of udev isn't required to run Linux so some people don't use it.
But many distributions install it by default.</P>
<P>Devfs was a good idea and was claimed to be more efficient than udev.
But unfortunately, the author of devfs didn't maintain it for long and
it allegedly became not too well maintained.  So for better or worse
we now have udev instead although the debate of devfs vs. udev still
continues.  For a detailed description of devfs see: 
<A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/docs/devfs.html</A> Also see
the kernel documentation tree: filesystems/devfs.</P>
<P>The names of devices for the devfs can be used in udev, but usually
are not and may not be simple to activate.  Here's the devfs names for
serial devices: ttyS1 becomes tts/1, ttyUSB1 becomes /usb/tts/1, and
ttyACM1 is /usb/acm/1.  Note that the number 1 above is just an
example.  It could be replaced by 0, 2, 3, 4, etc.  Some more examples
of udev names: ttyS2 becomes tts/2 (Serial port), tty3 becomes vc/3
(Virtual Console), ptyp1 becomes pty/m1 (PTY master), ttyp2 becomes
pty/s2 (PTY slave).  "tts" looks like a directory which contains
devices "files": 0, 1, 2, etc.  All of these new names were put in the
/dev directory although optionally one may put them elsewhere.</P>
<P>For devfs, device names in the /dev directory are created automatically
by the corresponding driver.  Thus, if serial support comes from a
module and that module isn't loaded yet, there will not be any serial
devices in the /dev directory.  This can be confusing: you physically
have serial ports but don't see them in the /dev directory.  However,
if a device name is requested (attempt to open it) by a communication
program and the serial module isn't loaded, the kernel is supposed to
try to find a driver for it and create a name for it in the /dev
directory.</P>
<P>This works OK if it finds a driver.  But suppose there is no driver
found for it.  For example, if you try to use "setserial" to configure
a port that the driver failed to detect, it claims there is no such
port.  How does one create a devfs port in this case?</P>
<P>For multiport devices for example, /dev/ttyF9 becomes /dev/ttf/9, or
in a later version /dev/tts/F9.  Substitute for F (or f) whatever
letter(s) your multiport board uses for this purpose.  A multiport
driver is supposed to create a devfs name similar to the above and put
it into the /dev directory</P>
