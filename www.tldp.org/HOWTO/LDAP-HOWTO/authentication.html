>6.2. Authentication using LDAP</H1
><P
>To access the LDAP service, the LDAP client first must authenticate itself to 
the service. That is, it must tell the LDAP server who is going to be accessing
 the data so that the server can decide what the client is allowed to see and 
do. If the client authenticates successfully to the LDAP server, then when the 
server subsequently receives a request from the client, it will check whether 
the client is allowed to perform the request. This process is called access 
control. </P
><P
>In LDAP, authentication is supplied in the "bind" operation. Ldapv3 supports 
three types of authentication: anonymous, simple and SASL authentication. A 
client that sends a LDAP request without doing a "bind" is treated as an 
anonymous client. Simple authentication consists of sending the LDAP server the
 fully qualified DN of the client (user) and the client's clear-text password. 
This mechanism has security problems because the password can be read from the 
network. To avoid exposing the password in this way, you can use the simple 
authentication mechanism within an encrypted channel (such as SSL), provided 
that this is supported by the LDAP server. </P
><P
>Finally, SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (RFC 2222). It 
specifies a challenge-response protocol in which data is exchanged between the 
client and the server for the purposes of authentication and establishment of a
security layer on which to carry out subsequent communication. By using SASL, 
LDAP can support any type of authentication agreed upon by the LDAP client and 
server. 
The Cyrus-SASL package is available at the following URL: <A

>Further on authenticating users to access information from your Directory Tree,
 your LDAP server can authenticate users from other services too (Sendmail, 
Login, Ftp, etc.). This is accomplished migrating specific user information to 
your LDAP server and using a mechanism called PAM (Pluggable Authentication 
Module). The authentication module for LDAP is available as a tar ball on the following 
address:
