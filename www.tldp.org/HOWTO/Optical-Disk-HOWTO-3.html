<A HREF="mailto:Daniel Kobras &lt;kobras@linux.de>">Daniel Kobras &lt;kobras@linux.de></A><P>Magneto optical drives use a "far field" magnetic field and a laser to
change polarization of a magnetic media. At temperatures below
180-200°C (350-390°F) magnetic polarization is "frozen" into the
media. However when heated above this so-called Curie-temperature a
static external magnetic field can change the polarization. When the 
media cools down below its Curie-temperature, the information is frozen 
again. A high power write laser is used to heat the disk surface to the
appropriate
temperature at which time the "Far field" can set the polarization
on the disk magnetic surface.
<P>Read back is based on the so-called Kerr effect, i. e. depending
on the direction of the magnetic field on the disk's surface, the plane
of polarization of the incoming laser beam is slightly rotated and the
information can be restored.
<P>
<P>
<P>The use of a laser for polarization change allows for bit and
track densities much higher than on conventional "flying" magnetic
heads. The "far field" means no more "head crashes" - that is assuming
your disk label doesn't peal off during the load or you don't
leave one of those sticky pads on the disk cartridge. Nowadays the most 
commonly used 3.5" media have a capacity of 640MB[*] per platter but there
are still media with 540MB, 230MB and 128MB. On some models both sides 
of the media are used yielding up to a capacity of 1.3GB - you must 
remove the media and flip it over to use the other 640MB though. There 
are 5.25" media with up to a total of 2.6GB, but these have to be flipped 
as well.
<P>The major drawback with ordinary magneto optical media was their need
for an extra erase cycle considerably slowing down write speed. That's
where LIMDOW media come in. LIMDOW (Light Intensity Modulated Direct
OverWrite) disks use a more sophisticated set of five different magnetic
layers. Thus the erase cycle can be omitted yielding a 33% speed up, as
only one write and one verify cycle have to be performed. Read back is
identical to ordinary disks. Please check with your drives manual if
you want to use LIMDOW media. I only have experience with Fujitsu's
M2513 which works well with LIMDOW. As far as other drives are concerned
I simply don't know.
<P>Manufacturers claim the life time of magneto optical media to be 30 years
and up. Disks can be rewritten at least 10 million times (1 million for
LIMDOW media). Reading is claimed safe for at least 100 million times.
<P>[*] There's a sort of religious discussion going on whether 1MB should
be understood as 1x1.000x1.000 bytes or rather 1x1.024x1.024 bytes. 
Here we use 1MB==1.000.000 bytes, the definition preferred by vendors
for obvious reasons. Don't worry if Linux reports your media to be
smaller - it's just a matter of definition.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Setup</A>
</H2>

<P>First of all, make sure your MO drive is sanely jumpered, i.e. make sure
its SCSI id is unique on your system, Parity checking and SCAM mode 
settings resemble those of your other SCSI devices as well as your
controller and do _not_ enable any weird looking options such as "Mac
Mode" or the like. Your drive might be equipped with an internal write 
cache, but since Linux already does pretty good caching on its own, don't
expect too much of a performance gain, if any. Also keep in mind that each
additional level of caching is a source of possible data loss or
corruption in case of failing hardware. Consequently the recommended 
paranoia setting is to turn off the write cache.
<P>As long as you're not using 640MB disks, setting up the MO drive is rather
straightforward. Assuming your drive is properly installed, at boot/insmod 
time, your SCSI-Controller should notify you of the newly added drive
and configure another SCSI device like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb... (Keep
in mind that the SCSI bus is scanned with increasing SCSI id, so if
your SCSI hard disk for example is ID 4 and used to be /dev/sda and your
MO drive has ID 3, the MO will now be /dev/sda whilst the HD is /dev/sdb.)
Working with your MO is no different from working with an ordinary hard
disk. You can partition it (more information on this topic is given below),
create file systems, mount it as usual. Note that as long as the disk is
mounted the drive is locked and you won't be able to change the disk.
<P>Be careful when trying to get 640MB disks to work. These use a
hard-sector size of 2048 bytes, 2.0.xx kernels will support only
512 and 1024 bytes per sector. However 2048 byte support has been added
to 2.1.32 and up. If you for some reason have to stick to 2.0.xx, there 
are several patches floating around, for example at
<P>* http://liniere.gen.u-tokyo.ac.jp/2048.html,
* http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/&nbsp;orschaer/mo/
* http://elektra.e-technik.uni-ulm.de/&nbsp;mbuck/linux/patches.html
<P>Be sure to use a either a patched version of fdisk available at some
of the sites above or a recent enough version from the official util-
linux package supporting the -b option. (Invoke with fdisk -b 2048 
/dev/sdXX when partitioning 2048 byte media.) 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Access</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two alternatives of how to access your disks: the ordinary
method of creating one or more partitions or just accessing the raw
drive, which in Win/DOS environments is also known as the superfloppy
format.
<P>The first method will require non-640MB disks or a 2048-byte-aware fdisk,
the latter is suitable for any kind of disk, however these disks cannot
be read with Windows NT up to version 4.0. There's a comment on
Fujitsu's web-pages that super-floppy support will be added to NT in the
future.
<P>Assume your MO drive is /dev/sdb. To create a partition simply enter
fdisk /dev/sdb (or fdisk -b 2048 /dev/sdb with 640MB media and a 
recent copy of fdisk) as root and go on like you were to partition a 
hard disk. If unsure about what to do, have a look at the fdisk man page. 
Next create a file-system on each partition with a command like
mke2fs -m 0 /dev/sdb1. For 640MB disks be sure to specify the
-b 2048 flag. If you want to use super-floppies instead, leave out the
fdisk part and create your file-system on the raw device, for example
mke2fs -b 2048 -m 0 /dev/sdb. mke2fs will request confirmation before
formatting a raw device. You might want to double check if /dev/sdb
*really* is your MO drive and not your hard disk by chance. :) During
the boot process (or when loading the low level SCSI module), Linux might 
moan about an invalid partition table if a super-floppy is in the MO drive. 
You can safely ignore this message.
<P>*NOTE: Partitions on 2048 byte sectored media were broken throughout
the whole 2.1 kernel series, meaning that you can happily 
partition your media with 2.1.xxx but will be unable to use
them with any OS other than Linux 2.1! In other words: DON'T
DO IT. If for any reason you still have to access your MOs on
Linux 2.1 use super-floppies which do fine. This problem hopefully
is completely fixed starting with Linux 2.2.2.
<P>File-systems other than ext2 will work on non-640MB disks as well, for
640MB disks there are some caveats: 2048 byte blocks must be supported
by the low level file-system code in the kernel and the appropriate
mkfs tool should take an argument like -b 2048 to specify the block
size. Kernel requirements are met at least for ext2 and msdos/vfat code
in the 2.1.xx kernel line. The above mentioned patches should fix this as
well for 2.0.xx kernels. I don't have any experience with other
file-systems so I'd appreciate any comments. Of the mkfs tools mke2fs
will definitely accept the -b flag. mkdosfs is trickier though: there's
no top level maintainer anymore, but some distributions have their own
maintainers and ship their own versions. Debian's mkdosfs is one such
example. Beginning with version 1.0-17 it supports media with large
sector sizes. You have to add an option -S 2048. Pass -I as well if
you want to format a super-floppy. The latest Debian version of mkdosfs
should always be available from ftp.debian.org. Look out for a
package called dosfstools.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Speed</A>
</H2>

<P>For the really curious but still undecided I've crammed up
some figures as returned by bonnie. These are for the Fujitsu M2513
spinning at 3600 rpm, an outdated model now replaced by a version
spinning at 4300 rpm. I guess the transfer rates for the new drive
will scale with the spin ratio or pretty close to it. Tests were
performed running a slightly patched 2.2.2pre4 kernel. (Err... looks 
like I've disabled verify on my drive, better not do that!)

As you can see, I have two SCSI devices attached: one CD-ROM drive and
one MO drive. As CD-ROMs do have SCSI devices of their own (/dev/scdX),
the MO is assigned to /dev/sda.
<P>Let's create an ext2-based super-floppy on the media:

Now mount the media to directory /mnt/mo (which already exists).

/mnt/mo can now be used like any ordinary hard disk. You may also
choose to add a line like the following to your /etc/fstab:
<HR>
<PRE>
/dev/sda    /mnt/mo    ext2 defaults,noauto 0 0
</PRE>
<HR>

Then mount /mnt/mo will suffice to mount any ext2-formatted media.
Before removing the media from your MO drive, don't forget to unmount it.
<HR>
<PRE>
yksi:/mnt/mo# umount /mnt/mo            # (Whoops!)
umount: /mnt/mo: device is busy
yksi:/mnt/mo# cd ..

Pretty easy, isn't it?
