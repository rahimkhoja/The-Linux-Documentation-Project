<P>In the past, we used to compress files in order to save disk space. Today,
disk space is cheap - but bandwidth is limited. By compressing data streams,
you achieve two goals:
<P>1) You save bandwidth/transfered volume (that is important if you have
to pay for traffic or if your network is loaded.).
<P>2) Speeding up low-bandwidth connections (Modem, GSM, ISDN).
<P>This HowTo explains how to save both bandwith and connection time by using
tools like SSH1, SSH2, OpenSSH or LSH.
