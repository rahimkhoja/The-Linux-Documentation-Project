<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Setup the Linux-system for writing CD-ROMs</A></H2>

<P>
<P>This section applies to the following types of CD-writers: SCSI, IDE/ATAPI
and the devices for the parallel port. USB CD-writers are not supported as
of May 2000. Non-SCSI writers require compatibility
drivers, which make them appear as if they were real SCSI devices. On the
one side such a unifying strategy is easy ("everything is SCSI"), because
on the application level you can share your knowledge with other users
regardless of their kind of CD-writer. On the other side, you have to
reconfigure applications like audio CD players or the mount utility to
reflect the change of the driver name. For example, if you accessed your
ATAPI CD-writer through the device file /dev/hdc before, you will have to
access it through /dev/scd0 after activating the SCSI compatibility
drivers.
<P>Once you succeed setting up your hardware and the rest of your Linux-system,
the command <CODE>cdrecord -scanbus</CODE> shows you a list of devices
on your SCSI busses. 
The goal of this section is to guide you in setting
up your Linux-system, so that you finally end up seeing something like:

<P>The example was provided by J&ouml;rg Schilling and shows a total of four
CD-writers. Please note that -scanbus also reports other devices,
e.g. regular CD-ROMs and hard disk drives. The last column gives the SCSI
description of the device, from which you cannot clearly distinguish
ordinary CD-ROM drives from those with burning capability. But the product
identification (middle column) often has hints about the feature in form of
a R, -R or -RW.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Quickstart</A>
</H2>

<P>This section is an attempt to provide an fast and easy description of the
configuration. Not all possible setups are covered, but please go on and
try it out anyways. First of all, check the Linux kernel version printed by
the command "uname -r".  It should be something like 2.0.X or 2.2.Y, where
X is higher than 36 and Y is higher than 11. If you run older versions or
the so called development kernels, you are on your own. Installing a new
kernel is as much work as fixing an old one, so I have removed all hints
you need for buggy kernels.
<P>The listing below shows a set of commands you could start with. The
commands create device file entries under /dev unless they already exists.

<P>Hardware access is usally implemented through device files under Linux.  So
before any other thing you make sure those files do exists in the
directory /dev. Still nobody could give me a compelling reason why this has
not been automated through techniques like the device filesystem
(devfs). The devfs is available for years know, brings a safer (!) and a far
clearer naming of devices and makes the device entries appear automatically
under /dev. Some prominent people argue devfs is not the perfect solution,
but they do not come up with anything better, not even something comparable
and last but least nothing available and tested now. Lets start to use
devfs, so I can remove the above commands from this document. (

<P>
<P>Next thing to ensure is, that the Linux kernel is equiped with the
necessary drivers. The following commands check various files for the
presence of drivers in the running Linux kernel. Usally the command
"cdrecord -scanbus" should trigger an automatic loading of all drivers. In
case a driver is not present in the kernel afterwards, it is reported and
the modularized driver (module) is manually loaded through insmod.

<P>
<P>Please read the next chapter if insmod complains about missing module files.
If you are
in text mode (console), the loading of modules may cause some messages to
be printed on your screen. If you are in graphics mode (X11, KDE, Gnome),
you can recall these messages with the command dmesg.
<P>There are several ways to load the modules next time you start
up your Linux system: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
(1) Put the relevant insmod command into the startup sequence
    (a shell script named rc.local or equivalent).
(2a) Run kerneld or kmod and
(2b) configure them in /etc/modules.conf (to be more precise,
     you configure the utility modprobe, which is called by the daemons)
</PRE>

<P>
<P>People with a SCSI-writer can skip the rest of this section, because
cdrecord will most likely already detect their hardware. If not, then
please send me an email with some information about your setup, so I can
improve the section about SCSI-writers.
<P>Now to the people with CD-writers for IDE/ATAPI.  As
written in the previous chapter, you have to load the compatibility driver
ide-scsi. But this driver can only access your CD-Writer if no other
driver has already done so. In other words, you have to tell the
regular IDE driver to leave your CD-writer unrecognized, so the ide-scsi
driver can grab it.

<I>Table: device file names of IDE/ATAPI devices</I>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The table above shows the relation of device file names and the placing of
devices on the IDE busses. The device file name representing your CD-Writer
has to be passed to the driver in the Linux kernel. Example: hdb=ide-scsi.
Such a setting should be added to lilo.conf or chos.conf if the driver is
statically compiled into your kernel, which seems to be the most common
setup. If you need to pass more than one parameter to the kernel,
then seperate them with spaces (like shown in the chos example). The next
two listings show example configurations containing more lines than just
the relevant append-line. Please note the append- and cmdline-entries
are image-specific (ie. don't add them immediatly at the top).

are generally suggested to further automate the loading of the required
modules.

<P>If your CD-writer is the only CD-ROM attached to your machine, then
remember you have to access the CD-ROM in the writer through the device file
/dev/scd× where ×=0,..,8. You may want to change the symbolic name cdrom to
point to the new device file name. The listing below shows the command to
achieve this with the example scd0.

<H3>Special notes about SCSI CD-writers</H3>

<P>
<P>Please make sure that your writer is recognized by the BIOS of your SCSI
hostadaptor card. Every SCSI hostadaptor scans the SCSI bus after power on
and reports all devices found connected to the bus. The report includes
the SCSI ID of the devices and their product label. It makes no sense
to proceed unless your CD writer is listed in that report.
<P>If you plan to connect your SCSI device through the parallel port (not to
confuse with the IDE drives for the parallel port), you need a special
active cable and a special kernel driver. Read 
<A HREF="http://www.torque.net/parport/parscsi.html">http://www.torque.net/parport/parscsi.html</A> to learn more about this
option.
<P>
<H3>Special notes about CD-writers for the parallel port</H3>

<P>
<P>I have no clue about this, sorry. Please read 
<A HREF="http://www.torque.net/parport/paride.html">http://www.torque.net/parport/paride.html</A> or your local file
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/paride.txt.

<H3>Compiling missing kernel modules (optional)</H3>

<P>
<P>You don't need to read this section if you hardware is already sucessfully
recognized and configured by the previously described configuration steps.
<P>The Linux kernel can be equipped with drivers for various features. You can
compile the drivers into the kernel image statically or you can compile
them as a module for on-demand loading. The last method is preferred for
drivers not essential for bringing your Linux-system into life, because
your kernel will be smaller and faster then. However, some drivers are
essential for the system to come up and you shouldn't compile them as a
module. Example: if your system lives on an IDE hard disk, you must have the
driver for IDE hard disks in the kernel -- not as a module.
<P>There are three different types of CD-writers: SCSI, IDE/ATAPI and external
writers that work through the parallel port. The table shows how to
configure the Linux kernel for those hardware types. The first column of
the table is the section of the kernel configuration menu, where you can
find the setting. The second column is the description of the feature
(taken from the kernel configuration menu, too). The third column gives the
name of the resulting module. The columns named SCSI, IDE and PP contain
the necessary options for the associated hardware (PP = parallel port).

<P>Y stands for yes and means you should put the beast into the kernel.  M
stands for module and means you should or must compile this feature as a
module.  Y/M gives you the option to decide between either (order indicates
choices with less potential problems). Empty settings don't need to be
modified and not changing them increases the chance that the resulting
kernel will work for you (if it did before...). Especially in environments
where SCSI and ATAPI devices are mixed, you better build most things as
modules.
<P>Compiling loopback device is optional.  It allows you to test the image
before writing it to the media. If you want to be able to read CD-ROMs, you
need support for the ISO 9660 filesystem. This driver automatically
includes RockRidge Extensions. The Microsoft Joliet CD-ROM extensions have
to be explicitly added to the ISO 9660 filesystem. In any case, you need a
low-level driver for your hardware. Low-level refers to the driver, which
interacts directly with the hardware.  For SCSI and the parallel port,
there are a lot of low-level drivers available.
<P>Installing the resulting Linux-kernel is beyond the scope of this
HOWTO. Please consult the documentation of your Linux-distribution.
<P>Users of RedHat Linux be aware that you have to compile in the 
features "Ramdisk support" and "Initial ramdisk". Furthermore, you
have to generate a new ramdisk with the new modules by issuing a
command like "mkintrd --preload ide-cd initrd-2.2.14.img  2.2.14".
