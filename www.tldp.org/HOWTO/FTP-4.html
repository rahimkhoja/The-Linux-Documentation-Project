<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Console FTP clients</A></H2>

<P>The original ftp program was the original ftp client, and it is a good
investment to learn it. It's the only ftp client that you can be certain is
available on most systems (even Win32 comes with the ftp command, albeit an
archaic, braindead version of it).
<P>
<P>There are many other console-mode (text-only) ftp clients available. The
listing here is by no means comprehensive, but includes the most popular
ones. Search at 
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net">FreshMeat</A> to find more.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 NcFTP</A>
</H2>

<P>NcFTP is the all-time favorite ftp client of many Unix users. It comes
bundled with most Linux distributions, and offers many advanced features
such as tab completion and bookmarks. Version 2 of NcFTP had a curses based
full-screen mode. This was done away with in Version 3 (now in beta). 
<P>
<P>It's not 100% compatible with the commands that standard ftp uses. For
example, get and put in NcFTP act like mget and mput do in standard ftp. So
if you want to save a remote file as a different local filename, you'd have
to do get -z remotename localname. Thankfully, NcFTP has a nice online help
system to assist you in learning the commands. 
<P>
<P>You can get the latest version of NcFTP at 
<A HREF="http://www.ncftp.com">http://www.ncftp.com</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 lukemftp</A>
</H2>

<P>A port of the NetBSD FTP client to other systems, lukemftp derives its name
from the author of most of the enhanced features, which include:
command-line editing, command-line fetches of FTP and HTTP URLs (including
via proxies), context-sensitive word completion, dynamic progress bar, IPv6
support, modification time preservation, paging of local and remote files,
passive mode support (with fallback to active mode), SOCKS support, TIS FWTK
gate-ftp server support, and transfer rate throttling.
<P>
<P>I highly recommend lukemftp to users who don't want to change to anything
drastically different from the standard ftp client, but want more advanced
features.
<P>
<P>You can get the latest version of lukemftp at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/lukemftp/">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/lukemftp/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 lftp</A>
</H2>

<P>lftp is a sophisticated command line based FTP client. Like bash, it has job
control. It uses the GNU readline library for input, so you have command
line completion and editing. lftp also has bookmarks, mirroring support, and
can transfer several files in parellel.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 cftp</A>
</H2>

<P>Comfortable FTP (cftp) is a full screen mode client. What it lacks in
features, it makes up for in ease of use. You browse through the directories
using the arrow keys and enter.
<P>
<P>You should be able to get the latest version of cftp at 
<A HREF="http://ftp.giga.or.at/pub/nih/cftp/">http://ftp.giga.or.at/pub/nih/cftp/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 yafc</A>
</H2>

<P>Yafc is a very nice ftp client, with features including directory cache,
remote filename completion, aliases, colorized ls, recursive get/put/ls/rm,
nohup mode transfers, tagging (queueing), multiple connections, proxy
support and more. It has support for Kerberos4 authentication.
