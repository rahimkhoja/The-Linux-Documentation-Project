<P>
<P>This is the Linux Commercial HOWTO.  It contains a listing of
commercial software which is available for Linux.  The Linux Commercial HOWTO
doesn't contain any information on Linux distributions -- this is covered
by the Distribution HOWTO.
<P>
<P>If you contact any companies or purchase any products listed in this
document, please mention the Linux Commercial HOWTO.
<P>
<P>This document was originated by Harald Milz
<A HREF="mailto:Harald.Milz@Linux.org">&lt;Harald.Milz@Linux.org&gt;</A>.
and then maintained by Mr. Poet
<P>It is now maintained by Mr. Poet AND LinuxPorts
<A HREF="mailto:poet@linuxports.com">&lt;poet@linuxports.com&gt;</A>.
<P>If you need to know more about the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/ldp.html">Linux Documentation Project</A> or about Linux HOWTO's, feel free to
contact the supervisor Tim Bynum
<A HREF="mailto:linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu">&lt;linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu&gt;</A>.
<P>
<P>Tim Bynum will post the listing to several national and international
newsgroups on a monthly basis.  In addition, the Linux Commercial HOWTO
can be found on the World Wide Web at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxports.com/">http://commercial.cyrius.com</A>.  New versions
of the Linux Commercial HOWTO are always placed at this site first, so
please be sure to check if the copy you are reading is still up to date!
<P>
<P>The Linux Commercial HOWTO is not a forum for product announcements or
marketing hype; it is a service for potential customers and the whole
Linux community.  Resellers will not be listed; the list is for companies
who produce their software themselves.  Two main goals are being aimed at:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It shall help companies who want to run Linux to find software
solutions and applications.  The international distribution of this list
will enhance the contact opportunity.
</LI>
<LI>It is meant to prove the commercial useability of Linux and thus to
encourage other vendors to port their software as well.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Companies and developers who are offering their products for Linux and
interested in joining the Linux Commercial HOWTO are invited to fill out the
following form and contact me at
<A HREF="mailto:poet@linuxports.com">poet@linuxports.com</A>.
<P>
<P>This HOWTO contains tabular entries for each product (example follows).
The entry format is similar to the Linux Software Map (LSM) entry
(field/stanza lengths are arbitrary).  If you want me to add your entry
please <EM>keep short</EM>, otherwise I'll have to shorten your data.
Furthermore, please send me plain ASCII data; no HTML, and no PostScript.
