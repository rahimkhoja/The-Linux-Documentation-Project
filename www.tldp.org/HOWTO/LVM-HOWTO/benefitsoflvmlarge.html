>2.3. Benefits of Logical Volume Management on a Large System</H1
><P
>&#13;        The benefits of logical volume management are more obvious on large
        systems with many disk drives.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Managing a large disk farm is a time-consuming job, made
        particularly complex if the system contains many disks of different
        sizes.  Balancing the (often conflicting) storage requirements of
        various users can be a nightmare.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        User groups can be allocated to volume groups and logical volumes
        and these can be grown as required. It is possible for the system
        administrator to "hold back" disk storage until it is required.  It
        can then be added to the volume(user) group that has the most
        pressing need.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        When new drives are added to the system, it is no longer necessary
        to move users files around to make the best use of the new storage;
        simply add the new disk into an existing volume group or groups and
        extend the logical volumes as necessary.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        It is also easy to take old drives out of service by moving the
        data from them onto newer drives - this can be done online, without
        disrupting user service.
      </P
