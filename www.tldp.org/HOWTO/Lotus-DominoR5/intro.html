>1.1. Why a Domino R5 installation mini-HOWTO?</H2
><P
>&#13;
	I faced Domino for Linux in February 2002. It happened because of unstable
	Domino R5 functioning on an Windows NT Server with powerful hardware
	resources. I read the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Understanding Domino for Linux"</SPAN
> white paper and I
	decided to move our Domino server to Linux. My first Linux distribution was
	Mandrake 8.1. I know this French distribution is one of the easiest and
	friendly for a newbie. Now it has worked pretty well for more than 10 months
	without any interference. Cool :) A few months ago the chairmen decided to
	implement one more Domino server at our high school; we had no money to
	purchase a powerful server and I made up my mind to deploy it on Linux
	again with existing hardware. Now we have a very stable second one on SuSE
	7.3 (I have studied this distribution already) with poor hardware (CPU:
	Celeron 400, RAM: 192MB, HDD: 20GB IDE).

	</P
><P
>&#13;
	As time permits, I hope to provide hints and tips for improving
	performance of Domino on Linux, and for configuring the environment on
	various Linux distributions.

>1.2. Who should read this mini-HOWTO?</H2
><P
>&#13;
	If you plan to save your employer's money and get amazing stability (and
	save your time) you should think about Domino on Linux. This mini-HOWTO
	helps you to install and configure Domino on the Linux distributions
	supported by IBM Lotus Software (SuSE) and others (Mandrake). I describe
	specific prerequisites and quirks for each distribution. I do not want
	anyone to repeat my sleepless nights and all-day-long red eyes.
