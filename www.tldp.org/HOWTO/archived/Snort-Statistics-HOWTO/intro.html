NAME="INTRO">1. Introduction</H1
><P
>   This document was written when I created an IDS sensor with Snort and
   using some statistic tools in order to help others implementing it. If at
   least one out there can be helped it has been worth the work.   
  </P
><P
>   Snort is an excellent Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) for various
   unices. The Snort homepage can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.snort.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.snort.org/</A
>. The version
   described here is 1.8.3 which was the actual version at the time of writing.
  </P
><P
>   The statistic tools I will describe here are ACID, a database analysis tool
   for Snort which can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.cert.org/kb/acid/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cert.org/kb/acid/</A
> and
   SnortSnarf, a statistic tool for Snort logs downloadable from
   <A
HREF="http://www.silicondefense.com/software/snortsnarf/index.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>   http://www.silicondefense.com/software/snortsnarf/index.htm</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   Additional support packages are needed for ACID. These are a PHP4 capable
   webserver like <EM
>apache</EM
> (<A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.apache.org/</A
>), PHPlot used for
   creating graphs in PHP (<A
HREF="http://www.phplot.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.phplot.com/</A
>) and ADODB used
   for connecting to databases with PHP (<A
HREF="http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://php.weblogs.com/ADODB/</A
>).
  </P
><P
>   The description also includes which additional software is needed for ACID
   and how to configure along with some scripts I use including a changed
   version of the snortd initscript and a short chapter about swatch (<A
HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~atkins/swatch"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.stanford.edu/~atkins/swatch</A
>) a log file watcher script written
   in perl. I created a swatch RPM which can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.lug-burghausen.org/projects/Snort-Statistics/swatch-3.0.2-1.noarch.rpm"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.lug-burghausen.org/projects/Snort-Statistics/swatch-3.0.2-1.noarch.rpm</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   One hint for those interested in maintaining more than one snort sensor: You
   might take a look at IDSPM (IDS Policy Manager) at <A
HREF="http://www.activeworx.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.activeworx.com/</A
> which is
   an application to maintain various sensors with different policies along with
   merging capabilities for new rules and a lot more. The only "nasty" thing is
   that it runs on W2K/XP and is not (yet?) Open Source.
