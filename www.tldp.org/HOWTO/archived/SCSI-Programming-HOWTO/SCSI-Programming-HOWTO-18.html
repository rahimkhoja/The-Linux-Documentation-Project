<P>The generic SCSI interface bridges the gap between user applications
and specific devices. But rather than bloating a lot of programs with
similar sets of low-level functions, it would be more desirable to
have a shared library with a generalized set of low-level functions
for a particular purpose.  The main goal should be to have independent
layers of interfaces.  A good design would separate an application
into low-level and hardware independent routines. The low-level
routines could be put into a shared library and made available for all
applications. Here, standardized interfaces should be followed as much
as possible before making new ones.
<P>By now you should know more than I do about the Linux generic SCSI
interface. So you can start developing powerful applications
for the benefit of the global Linux community now...
