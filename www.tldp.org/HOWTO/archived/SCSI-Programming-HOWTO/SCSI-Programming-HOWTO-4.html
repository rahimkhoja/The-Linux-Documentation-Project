<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Kernel Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>You must have a supported SCSI controller, obviously. Furthermore,
your kernel must have controller support as well as generic support
compiled in. Configuring the Linux kernel (via <CODE>make config</CODE> under
/usr/src/linux) typically looks like the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 ...
*
* SCSI support
*
SCSI support? (CONFIG_SCSI) [n] y
*
* SCSI support type (disk, tape, CDrom)
*
 ...
Scsi generic support (CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG) [n] y
*
* SCSI low-level drivers
*
 ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If available, modules can of course be build instead.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Device Files</A>
</H2>

<P>The generic SCSI driver uses its own device files, separate from those
used by the other SCSI device drivers. They can be generated using
the <CODE>MAKEDEV</CODE> script, typically found in the <CODE>/dev</CODE>
directory. Running <CODE>MAKEDEV sg</CODE> produces these files:

<P>Note that these are character devices for raw access. On some systems
these devices may be called <CODE>/dev/{sg0,sg1,...}</CODE>, depending on your
installation, so adjust the following examples accordingly.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Device Mapping</A>
</H2>

<P>These device files are dynamically mapped to SCSI id/LUNs on your SCSI
bus (LUN = logical unit). The mapping allocates devices consecutively
for each LUN of each device on each SCSI bus found at time of the SCSI
scan, beginning at the lower LUNs/ids/buses. It starts with the first SCSI
controller and continues without interruption with all following
controllers. This is currently done in the initialisation of the SCSI
driver.
<P>For example, assuming you had three SCSI devices hooked up with ids 1,
3, and 5 on the first SCSI bus (each having one LUN), then the
following mapping would be in effect:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/dev/sga -> SCSI id 1
/dev/sgb -> SCSI id 3
/dev/sgc -> SCSI id 5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you now add a new device with id 4, then the mapping (after the
next rescan) will be:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/dev/sga -> SCSI id 1
/dev/sgb -> SCSI id 3
/dev/sgc -> SCSI id 4
/dev/sgd -> SCSI id 5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Notice the change for id 5 -- the corresponding device is no longer
mapped to <CODE>/dev/sgc</CODE> but is now under <CODE>/dev/sgd</CODE>.
<P>Luckily newer kernels allow for changing this order.
<P>
<H3>Dynamically insert and remove SCSI devices</H3>

<P>If a newer kernel and the <CODE>/proc</CODE> file system is running,
a non-busy device can be removed and installed 'on the fly'.
<P>To remove a SCSI device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
echo "scsi remove-single-device a b c d" > /proc/scsi/scsi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and similar, to add a SCSI device, do
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
echo "scsi add-single-device a b c d" > /proc/scsi/scsi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>where
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      a == hostadapter id (first one being 0)
      b == SCSI channel on hostadapter (first one being 0)
      c == ID
      d == LUN (first one being 0)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So in order to swap the <CODE>/dev/sgc</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/sgd</CODE> mappings from
the previous example, we could do
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 4 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 5 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 5 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 4 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>since generic devices are mapped in the order of their insertion.
<P>When adding more devices to the scsi bus keep in mind there are
limited spare entries for new devices. The memory has been allocated
at boot time and has room for 2 more devices.
<P>
