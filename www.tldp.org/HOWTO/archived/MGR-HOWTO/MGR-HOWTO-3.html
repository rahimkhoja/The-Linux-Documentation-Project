<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Installing MGR</A></H2>

<P>The latest source distribution can be FTPed from the directory
<CODE>ftp://archimedes.nosc.mil/pub/Mgr/69</CODE>
or Mosaiced from <CODE>http://archimedes.nosc.mil/Mgr/69</CODE>.
The same should be found at
<CODE>ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/MGR</CODE> and its mirrors.
Older versions of this distribution
from Haardt can be found on <CODE>tsx-11.mit.edu</CODE> and perhaps elsewhere.
Pre-Linux versions of <B>MGR</B> from Uhler and others have been found at
<CODE>ftp://bellcore.com/pub/mgr</CODE>, but I think they are gone now.
I have saved a copy of everything about <B>MGR</B> seen on the Internet,
but I am not aware of anything weighty
that is missing from this Linux/Sun distribution.
<B>MGR</B> has been through a lot of versions and releases,
but the current *Linux* version number is 0.69.  This version number
could jump to 1.0 when stable 256-color VGA code for Linux appears
(for more than one video card type).
RCS version numbers have increased from Bellcore's 4.3 up to our 4.13 now.
<P>Required tools to build this distribution of <B>MGR</B> are m4 (GNU, or
perhaps another supporting the -D option), make (GNU, or perhaps
another supporting include) and *roff for the docs.  Also sh,
awk, and POSIX install.  Binary distributions are not assembled often
so you need an ANSI C compiler environment, e.g. gcc.
<P>A Linux installation requires Linux 0.99.10 or better
(1.2.13 is what I actually test on now),
an HGC, EGA, VGA, or SVGA graphics card, and a mouse.  Mouses supported
are: serial Microsoft mouse, serial MouseSystems 3 and 5 byte
mouse, serial MMSeries mouse, serial Logitech mouse, PS/2 mouse,
or a bus mouse.
With Buckey (Meta) hot keys enabled, even a mouseless system could
do a certain amount of useful work under <B>MGR</B>.
The VGA 640x480 monochrome graphics mode is
supported out of the box, as is 640x350 and 640x200.  To run
800x600, or other modes that your BIOS can initialize and which
do not require bank-switching, you need to run a small program
(supplied as <CODE>src/vgamisc/regs.exe</CODE>)
under DOS or an emulator to read the VGA registers
and write a header file which you place in the
directory <CODE>src/libbitblit/linux</CODE>,
so that it can be <CODE>#include</CODE>'d
by the <CODE>vga.c</CODE> file there.
Samples of these files are supplied, but please create your own.
Some VGA cards can use 128k
windows, and these might run higher monochrome resolutions.
<P>The Linux-colorport code also runs in the standard
320x200x256 color VGA mode without difficulty, because no bank switching
is required.  If you think of how few 64000 pixels is, you would
realize this color mode is quite limited.
Non-fast, but simple, bank-switching code has
been added in version 0.65, and it works with a Tseng ET4000 card
in 640x480x256 and 800x600x256 modes.  The S3 code does not
work in super VGA resolutions, yet.  Supporting new super VGA cards
requires writing one function to switch banks and then making sure that
the desired screen mode can be initialized from a register dump,
possibly with hand-tweaking.  The Linux color servers generally
mangle the screen fonts, necessitating use of restorefont as in runx.
If someone were to extract the VGA initialization code out of X,
this might make MGR work on a lot more color systems.
<P>Suns with SunOS 4.1.2+ and <CODE>bwtwo</CODE>, <CODE>cgthree</CODE>, or
<CODE>cgsix</CODE> frame buffers are supported.
Their speed handling color is good.
Coherent installations should refer to the
<CODE>Versions/README.Coh</CODE> file in the source distribution.
Porting the
latest-and-greatest <B>MGR</B> to another POSIX-like system which
provides <CODE>select()</CODE> and pty's and direct access to a bitmapped
frame-buffer ought to be straightforward, just implementing the
<CODE>libbitblit</CODE> library based on the <CODE>sunmono</CODE> or
<CODE>colorport</CODE> code, say.
<P>If you want to install everything, you need 7 MB disk space for
binaries, fonts, manual pages etc.  The sources are about 4.5 MB,
plus object files during compilation.
<P>Normally, <CODE>/usr/mgr</CODE> should be either the directory or a link to the
directory where you install <B>MGR</B> stuff for runtime use.  Typing
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/mgr; tar xvfz whereveryouputit/mgrusr-0.69.tgz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and optionally
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/mgr; tar xvfz wherever/morefonts-0.69.tgz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will unpack these.  The source can be put anywhere, e.g. typing
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/src/local/mgr; tar xvfz wherever/mgrsrc-0.69.tgz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to unpack the sources from <CODE>archimedes.nosc.mil</CODE>.
<P>The source tree can be compiled from one top-level Makefile which
invokes lower-level Makefiles, all of which &quot;include&quot;
a <CODE>&quot;Configfile&quot;</CODE>
at the top level.  The <CODE>Configfile</CODE> is created by an interactive sh
script named <CODE>Configure</CODE>, which asks you questions,
then runs m4 on a <CODE>Configfile.m4</CODE>.
So you type something like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
chdir /usr/src/local/mgr
sh ./Configure
make first
make depend
make install
make clean
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It might be wise, before running make, to eyeball the <CODE>Configfile</CODE>
generated by the <CODE>Configure</CODE> script, checking that it looks reasonable.
(At least one m4 poops out (Sun <CODE>/usr/bin/m4</CODE>),
creating a very short <CODE>Configfile</CODE>.
If this happens, try hand editing a copy of <CODE>Configfile.sun</CODE> or
<CODE>Configfile.lx</CODE>)
One can also <CODE>make all</CODE> in any directory with a Makefile
as soon as the libraries have been compiled and installed.
The server, libraries, and some clients have been linted, but several
clients are K&amp;R C code that generates many compiler warnings.
<P>Several flags in MGRFLAGS can be added/omitted in the Configfile
to change some
optional features in the server, viz:
<DL>
<DT><B>-DWHO</B><DD><P>muck utmp file so &quot;who&quot; works
<DT><B>-DVI</B><DD><P>code for clicking the mouse in vi moving the cursor
<DT><B>-DDEBUG</B><DD><P>enable debugging output selectable with -d options.
<DT><B>-DFASTMOUSE</B><DD><P>XOR the mouse track
<DT><B>-DBUCKEY</B><DD><P>for hot-key server commands without mousing
<DT><B>-DPRIORITY</B><DD><P>for priority window scheduling instead of 
round-robin; the active window gets higher priority
<DT><B>-DCUT</B><DD><P>for cut/paste between windows and a global snarf buffer
<DT><B>-DMGR_ALIGN</B><DD><P>forces window alignment for fast scrolling (monochrome)
<DT><B>-DKILL</B><DD><P>kills windows upon tty i/o errors
<DT><B>-DSHRINK</B><DD><P>use only some of the screen ($MGRSIZE in environment)
<DT><B>-DNOSTACK</B><DD><P>don't permit event stacking 
<DT><B>-DBELL</B><DD><P>audibly ring the bell
<DT><B>-DKBD</B><DD><P>read <CODE>mgr</CODE> input from the sun kbd, instead of stdin.
This permits redirection of console msgs to a window.
<DT><B>-DFRACCHAR</B><DD><P>fractional character movement for proportional fonts
<DT><B>-DXMENU</B><DD><P>extended menu stuff (experimental)
<DT><B>-DMOVIE</B><DD><P>movie making extension which logs all operations to a
file for later replay -- not quite working under Linux
<DT><B>-DEMUMIDMSBUT</B><DD><P>Emulate a missing middle mouse button by chording
</DL>

Not all combinations of these options have been tested on all systems.
<P>The BITBLITFLAGS macro should contain <CODE>-DBANKED</CODE> if you're trying
out the super VGA color.
<P>C code for the static variables in the server containing icons and fonts
is generated by a translator from icon and font files.
<P>Not all the clients are compiled and installed by the Makefiles.
Clients found under <CODE>src/clients</CODE> having capitalized names or
not compiled by the supplied Makefiles may have problems compiling
and/or running, but they may be interesting to hack on.
Most of the screen drivers found under the <CODE>libbitblit</CODE> directory are
of mainly archeological interest. Grave robbing can be profitable.
<P>At some point check that your <CODE>/etc/termcap</CODE> and/or
<CODE>terminfo</CODE> file
contain entries for <B>MGR</B> terminals such as found in the <CODE>misc</CODE>
directory.  If all your software checks $TERMCAP in the environment,
this is not needed, as long as you run <CODE>eval `set_termcap`</CODE>
in each window.
<P><B>MGR</B> works better if run setuid root, because it wants to chown
ptys and write in the utmp file.  This helps the ify iconifier
client work better and the event passing mechanism be more secure.
On Linux, root permissions are <EM>required</EM> in order to do in/out on the
screen device.  Otherwise, you decide whether to trust it.
<P>In versions around 0.62 there are troubles on the Sun with using
the csh as the default shell.  Programs seem to run in a different
process group than the foreground process group of the window's pty,
in contradiction to man pages and posix specs.
There is no trouble with bash, sh, or rc.  Ideas why?
<P>
