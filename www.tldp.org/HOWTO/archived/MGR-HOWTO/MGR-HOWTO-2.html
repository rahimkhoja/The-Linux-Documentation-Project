<H2><A NAME="s2">2. What is the MGR window system?</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Function</A>
</H2>

<P><B>MGR</B> (ManaGeR) is a graphical window system.
The <B>MGR</B> server
provides a builtin window manager and windowed graphics terminal
emulation on color and monochrome bitmap displays.  <B>MGR</B> is
controlled by mousing pop-up menus, by keyboard interaction, and by
escape sequences written on pseudo-terminals by client software.
<P><B>MGR</B> provides each client window with: termcap-style terminal
control functions, graphics primitives such as line and circle
drawing; facilities for manipulating bitmaps, fonts, icons, and
pop-up menus; commands to reshape and position windows; and a
message passing facility enabling client programs to rendezvous
and exchange messages.  Client programs may ask to be informed
when a change in the window system occurs, such as a reshaped
window, a pushed mouse button, or a message sent from another
client program.  These changes are called events.
<B>MGR</B> notifies a
client program of an event by sending it an ASCII character string
in a format specified by the client program.  Existing
applications can be integrated into the windowing environment
without modification by having <B>MGR</B> imitate keystrokes in response
to user defined menu selections or other events.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P><B>MGR</B> currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD,
Sun 3/4 workstations with SunOS, and
Coherent.  Various older versions of <B>MGR</B> run on the Macintosh,
Atari ST MiNT, Xenix, 386-Minix, DEC 3100, and the 3b1 Unix-pc.
Many small, industrial, real-time systems under OS9 or Lynx in Europe
use (another variant of) Mgr for their user interface.
The programming interface is implemented in C and in ELisp,
although supporting clients written in other languages is quite
easy.
<P>Running <B>MGR</B> requires much less in resources than X, or even gcc.
It does not have the user-base, software repertory, or high-level
libraries of X or MS-Windows, say, but it is quite elegant
and approachable.
<P>It has been said that <B>MGR</B> is to X as Unix was to Multics.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 How do MGR, X11, and 8.5 compare?</A>
</H2>

<P><B>MGR</B> consists of a server with builtin window manager and terminal
emulator, and clients which run in this terminal emulator and use it
to communicate with the server.  No resource multiplexing is done.
<P>X11 consists of a server and clients, which usually connect to the
server using a socket.  All user visible things like terminal
emulators, window managers etc are done using clients.  No resource
multiplexing is done.
<P>8.5, the Plan 9 window system, is a resource multiplexer, as each
process running in a window can access <CODE>/dev/bitblt</CODE>,
<CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> and
<CODE>/dev/kbd</CODE> in its own namespace.  These are multiplexed to the
<CODE>/dev/bitblit</CODE>, <CODE>/dev/mouse</CODE> and <CODE>/dev/kbd</CODE>
in the namespace of 8.5.
This approach allows one to run 8.5 in an 8.5 window,
a very clean design.  8.5 further has an integrated window manager
and terminal emulator.
