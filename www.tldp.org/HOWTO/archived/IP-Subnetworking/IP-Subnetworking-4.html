<H2><A NAME="s4">4. What are subnets?</A></H2>

<P>A subnet is a way of taking a single IP network address and <B>locally</B>
splitting it up so that this single network IP address can actually be
used on several interconnected local networks. Remember, a single IP
network number can only be used on a single network.
<P>
<P>The important word here is <B>locally</B>: as far as the world outside the
machines and physical networks covered by the sub-netted IP network are
concerned, nothing whatsoever has changed - it is still just a single IP
network. This is important - sub-networking is a <B>local</B> configuration
and is invisible to the rest of the world.
