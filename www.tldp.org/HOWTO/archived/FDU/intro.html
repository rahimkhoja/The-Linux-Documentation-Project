><P
> An often heard complaint is the poor default fonts and font settings of X as
 implemented by many Linux distributions. Some programs use fixed width
 default fonts when a variable width font would be more appropriate. Other
 programs use fonts that are so small as to be practically unreadable. Many of 
 the fonts that are bundled with XFree86 are not of the same quality as found
 on some other platforms. XFree86 does come with a halfway decent courier
 font, but its Times and Helvetica fonts are simple bitmap fonts that pixelize
 when scaled. This is changing for the better recently, but a default Linux
 desktop still often needs some tweaking to get the best fonts possible.&#13;</P
><P
> This HOWTO attempts to show how to adjust various font settings, install new
 fonts, and a few other things that should greatly improve the appearance and
 readability of fonts on the X Window Desktop. This is done by adjusting the
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FontPath</TT
> in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> file, by
 adding switches to X server command line in <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>startx</B
> or
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xdm</B
> (and variants), by adding new fonts, and by 
 making sure TrueType fonts are installed and available. TrueType does
 indeed make a huge difference in many applications.&#13;</P

 issues! (So I guess nobody uses these since the silence is deafening?)&#13;</P

     use XFree86.org's X implementation, but there are other implentations

     most cases.

    TrueType font directory. There is no magic to this location, and could
    conceivably just as well be in any number of other locations. Some 
    distros may have a default location for TrueType fonts, and you may 
    want to use that instead.

>    References to "xfs" are to the xfs as packaged by Red Hat (and some other
    distros) for versions 6.x and later. This differs significantly in some
    respects from the stock XFree86 xfs. 
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    References to "Netscape" are to the entire suite of programs from Netscape:
    Communicator, Navigator, Messenger, etc. And for all intents and purposes,
    font configuration in Mozilla is very similar (but generally looks 
    better!).

><P
>    'XF86Config' is the X configuration file. This has changed to 
    'XF86Config-4' for XFree86 v4.x. For the most part, we'll just use
    'XF86Config' here.
   
   </P
><P
>    Also, while some aspects of XFree86 4.x configuration are the same as
    3.3.x, there are some significant differences. We'll only highlight the
    differences. So unless noted otherwise, any comments or examples should
    apply to both 3.3.x and 4.x versions.

>    File system layout varies somewhat from distribution to distribution. It 
    is impossible to stay on top of every conceivable variation of who keeps 
    which files where. So take the examples here with a grain of salt if the 
    PATHs don't seem to match your system.

   Include info on TrueType <SPAN

   freetype sources (thanks Andreas Oesterhelt!). A few new useful links,

><LI
><P
>   2.03: October 17, 2002. 
   Some brief notes on Red Hat 8.0 differences/newness, notably the changes 
   that accompany Xft2. More on the distinction of core X fonts and Xft (and
   then Xft2).
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   2.01: October 03, 2002. 
   Update links for obtaining the MS web fonts (TrueType fonts of choice).
   There are two <A
HREF="http://sf.net"
TARGET="_top"
>Sourceforge</A
> projects 
   with these fonts available, including.
   <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/font-tool/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sourceforge.net/projects/font-tool/</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   Add section to <A
HREF="apps.html#MOZILLA"
>Mozilla</A
> configuration to 
   include info on Xft and anti-aliasing.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   2.00: September 12, 2002. 
   Wow, MS has taken down their webfonts page :( Not good news. Installing
   TrueType is a key ingredient to better living through nice fonts.
  </P
><P
>   Major re-organization by moving the font server section to the appendix,
   since any recent distro is already installing these, or they are 
   not any longer needed.
  </P
><P
>   Some clarifications on gdkxft and font anti-aliasing. Finally, add 
   Aristotle Pagaltzis's perl script for converting <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fonts.dir</TT
>
   to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fonts.alias</TT
>. Include interesting example 
   of using anti-aliased TrueType fonts in <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm</B
>.
   Note that GNOME 2 is out. Fix the usual assorted broken links.
  </P
><P
>   Clarifications on <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>dpi</TT
> settings, and add tip 
   about unbalanced dpi causing major trouble with fonts.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   1.95: February 11, 2002. A few corrections. Removed the section on Fonts in
   KDE since this has to have changed, and I don't know anything about KDE
   (does anyone want to help here?). Added a brief section on gdkxft, which 
   adds anti-aliasing support for GTK+ 1.2 applications.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   1.9: November 5, 2001. A few new links and some minor catch ups only.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   1.8: June 25, 2001: Included a new section on Anti-aliasing and Xft from
   Danny Tholen <TT
CLASS="EMAIL"

   well documented subject. Also, Sebastiano Vigna's neat little package for
   downloading and installing MS webfonts: <A
HREF="http://freshmeat.net/webFonts4Linux"
TARGET="_top"
>http://freshmeat.net/webFonts4Linux</A
>.
   A few other odds and ends.

  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>  1.70: April 18, 2001: 
   Added links for converting Mac TrueType Fonts (thanks to Karl A. Krueger),
   links to Unicode TrueType fonts (thanks to Tzafrir Cohen for suggestions
   and URLs), and added a section on anti-aliasing with X 4.0.2 (or greater).
   Also, included a reference to <A
HREF="http://www.kyz.uklinux.net/cabextract.php3"
TARGET="_top"
>cabextract</A
>, a
   utility that is now available for extracting Win32 Fonts (among other
   things) from a Window's <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"cab"</SPAN
> archive.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>  1.60: March 21, 2001: 
   A few very minor changes. Most notable news is anti-aliasing support now 
   in XFree 4.02 (referenced in the Notes section only). Chinese translation 
   URL added.
