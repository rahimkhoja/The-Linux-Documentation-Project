<P>
<P>This document is intended to explain how to use Ultra-DMA aka Ultra-ATA
aka Ultra33 and Ultra66 hard drives and interfaces with Linux. In many cases there is 
no difficulty in using them, but some tweaking can increase performance. In 
other cases, you need to go to extraordinary lengths simply to access your 
hard drives.

<P>
<P>The information in this is document is, to the best of my knowledge, correct, and
should work. However, there may be typos, there may be mysterious 
transmission errors, and there may be strange incompatibilities within your 
own system that prevent the techniques described herein from working 
properly. So... before you go fiddling around with you hard drive, <B>BACK
UP ANY DATA YOU WANT TO KEEP!</B> If you are not already performing regular
backups, please start doing so for your own good.
