<P>
<P>Many people are trying Linux because they are looking for a 
really good <EM>Internet capable</EM> operating system. 
Also, there are institutes, universities, non-profits, and small
businesses which want to set up Internet sites on a
small budget. This is where the WWW-HOWTO comes in. This document 
explains how to set up clients and servers for the largest 
part of the Internet - <EM>The World Wide Web</EM>. 
<P>All prices in this document are stated in US dollars.  This document
assumes you are running Linux on an Intel platform.  Instructions and
product availability my vary from platform to platform.  There are many
links for downloading software in this document.  Whenever possible use a
mirror site for faster downloading and to keep the load down on the main
server.
<P>The US government
forbids US companies from exporting encryption stronger than 40 bit in
strength.  Therefore US companies will usually have two versions of
software.  The import version will usually support 128 bit, and the export
only 40 bit.  This applies to web browsers and servers supporting secure
transactions.  Another name for secure transactions is Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL).  We will refer to it as SSL for the rest of this document.
