<H2><A NAME="netscape"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Netscape Navigator/Communicator</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Different versions and options.</A>
</H2>

<P>Netscape Navigator is the King of WWW browsers.  Netscape Navigator can do 
almost everything. But on the other hand, it is one of the most memory hungry 
and resource eating program I've ever seen. 
<P>There are 3 different versions of the program:
<P>Netscape Navigator includes the web browser, netcaster (push client) 
and a basic mail program.
<P>Netscape Communicator includes the web browser, a web editor, an advanced 
mail program, a news reader, netcaster (push client), and a
group conference utility.
<P>Netscape Communicator Pro includes everything Communicator has plus a group
calendar, IBM terminal emulation, and remote administration features (administrators
can update thousands of copies of Netscape from their desk).
<P>In addition to the three versions there are two other options you must pick.  
<P>The first is full install or base install.  The full install includes
everything.  The base install includes enough to get you started.  You can
download the additional components as you need them (such as multimedia
support and netcaster).  These components can be installed by the Netscape
smart update utility (after installing goto help->software updates).  At
this time the full install is not available for Linux.
<P>The second option is import or export.  If you are from the US are Canada
you have the option of selecting the import version.  This gives you the
stronger 128 bit encryption for secure transactions (SSL).  The export version
only has 40 bit encryption, and is the only version allowed outside the US
and Canada.
<P>The latest version of the Netscape Navigator/Communicator/Communicator Pro 
is 4.03.  There are two different versions for Linux.  One is for the old
1.2 series kernels and one for the new 2.0 kernels.  If you don't have a 2.0
kernel I suggest you upgrade; there are many improvements in the new kernel. 
<P>Beta versions are also available.  If you try a beta version, they 
usually expire in a month or so!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Where to get </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The best way to get Netscape software is to go through their web site at
<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/download/">http://www.netscape.com/download/</A>.  They have menu's to guide
you through the selection.  When it ask for the Linux version, it is
referring to the kernel (most people should be using 2.0 by now).  If your
not sure which version kernel you have run 'cat /proc/version'.
Going through the web site is the only way to get the import versions.
<P>If you want an export version you can download them
directly from the Netscape FTP servers.  The FTP servers are also more up to
date. For example when I first wrote this the web interface did not have the
non-beta 4.03 for Linux yet, but it was on the FTP site.  Here are the links
to the export Linux 2.0 versions:
<P>Netscape Navigator 4.03 is at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/4.03/shipping/english/unix/linux20/navigator_standalone/navigator-v403-export.x86-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/4.03/shipping/english/unix/linux20/navigator_standalone/navigator-v403-export.x86-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz</A><P>Netscape Communicator 4.03 for Linux 2.0 (kernel) is at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/4.03/shipping/english/unix/linux20/base_install/communicator-v403-export.x86-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/4.03/shipping/english/unix/linux20/base_install/communicator-v403-export.x86-unknown-linux2.0.tar.gz</A><P>Communicator Pro 4.03 for Linux was not available at the time I wrote this.
<P>These url's will change as new versions come out.  If these links break you
can find them by fishing around at the FTP site
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/">ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/</A>. 
<P>These servers are heavily loaded at times.  Its best to wait for off peak
hours or select a mirror site.  Be prepared to wait, these
archives are large.  Navigator is almost 8megs, and Communicator base
install is 10megs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Installing</A>
</H2>

<P>This section explains how to install version 4 of Netscape Navigator,
Communicator, and Communicator Pro.
<P>First unpack the archive to a temporary directory.
Then run the <CODE>ns-install</CODE> script (type <CODE>./ns-install</CODE>).  Then make a symbolic link
from the <CODE>/usr/local/netscape/netscape</CODE> binary to
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/netscape</CODE>
(type <CODE>ln -s /usr/local/netscape/netscape /usr/local/bin/netscape</CODE>).
Finally set the system wide environment variable <CODE>$MOZILLA_HOME</CODE> to
<CODE>/usr/local/netscape</CODE> so Netscape can find its files.  If you are using bash
for your shell edit your <CODE>/etc/profile</CODE> and add the lines:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
MOZILLA_HOME="/usr/local/netscape"
export MOZILLA_HOME
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After you have it installed the software can automatically update itself
with smart update. 
Just run Netscape as root and goto help->software updates.  If you only got
the base install, you can also install the Netscape components from there.
<P>Note: This will not remove any old versions of Netscape, you must manually
remove them by deleting the Netscape binary and Java class file 
(for version 3).
