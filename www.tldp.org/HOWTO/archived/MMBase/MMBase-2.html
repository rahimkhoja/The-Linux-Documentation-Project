<P>On their website, the authors say the following about it:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>MMBase is an opensource publishing system. MMBase can be used to create big websites that can be maintained easily.</LI>
<LI>MMBase separates content from layout, in this way information can be reused easily.</LI>
<LI>MMBase is very unique in the way it maintains its information. MMBase creates an object cloud that is a digital representation of the 'real' world objects that are of interest for you.<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>In this document I will describe how to get MMBase running on a Debian Woody System, using
as many standard packages as possible. Though it is very easy to run MMBase using their 
automatic installation tools, you will end up with their version of a webserver, servlet engine 
and database.
<P>After a few days of playing with my own install, I think I can help others by describing 
which choices I made to get things running. I do not claim this is the only way, or the best way! 
But it worked for me :)
<P>
<P>The version of MMBase used is 1.5. Ofcourse everything might be different with another version.
<P>
<P>MMbase can run together with various webservers, databases, servlet engines and JRE's.
The programs/packages/versions I chose are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>MySQL-Server (3.23.49-8) </LI>
<LI>Tomcat4 (4.0.3-3) </LI>
<LI>j2sdk1.3 (1.3.1-1) (Java) </LI>
<LI>imagemagick (4:5.4.4.5-1)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Attention: The version numbers are those that were available in
the Woody distribution at the time of writing. Except for Java, which
came from a different location. See 
<A HREF="MMBase-3.html#java">Non standard package(s)</A>.
<P>
<P>Some other options for databases and webservers are described in the
installation notes for MMBase 1.5
