><P
>This document describes how to build a Linux system that runs
 on top of the SGI XFS journaling filesystem.  From the XFS FAQ: "XFS
 is a journalling filesystem developed by SGI and used in SGI's IRIX
 operating system. It is now also available under GPL for linux. It
 is extremely scalable, using btrees extensively to support large
 sparse files, and extremely large directories. The journalling capability
 means no more waiting for fsck's or worrying about meta-data corruption."
 Essentialy XFS is the filesystem SGI designed for its highend server
 systems, hence the subtitle of this document, "Linux on Steroids".

>As a fairly new member of the Irix System Administrator community
 I have fallen in love with the robustness of the filesystem that
 has been developed to support Irix (XFS of course).  So, needless
 to say I've been following the porting effort to Linux for quite
 some time and have dreamed of being able to run my Linux systems
 on top of an all XFS filesystem since the beginning.  The project
 has come to a point (actually nearly a year ago at the time of this
 writing) that this could actually be a reallity.  However, as is
 the case with a great deal of programming/porting projects, the documentation
 for such task is not always as readily available or easy to follow
 as one might hope.  This document is an attempt to remedy that situation.
