<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>The main goal of this document obviously is to make the new user
friendly with the many terms of connecting your Linux PC up to 
the Internet, obtaining IP addresses, domain names, and setting things
up. This guide is intended for the intermediate user in mind, although
intelligent newbies shouldn't have any problems.
