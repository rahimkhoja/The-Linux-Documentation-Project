<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Electronic Mail on your Linux Box</A></H2>

<P>One of the most important aspects of the Internet, is it's fasinating
capaiblity to transfer mail to and from countries, or more locally
perhaps. Linux is extreemly strong in easy mail packages for the console.
The one we're going to document today is called Pine (Program for Internet
Mail and News), made by the University of Washington, and to download the
mail, a program called Fetchmail, made by Eric S. Raymond. Both should be
included in your Linux distribution.
<P>Fetchmail is a program that downloads your e-mail from your server using
POP, transfers the mail onto your computer and then deletes it off the
server, much like programs like Eudora or Microsoft Internet Mail/Exchange
do. To configure and automate fetchmail, you use a file in your home
directory called .fetchmailrc. Simply open up &nbsp;/.fetchmailrc 
(Remember: your doing this bit as yourself, not as root) with your
favourite editor and observe the command lin eoptions below:
<P><EM>poll mail.yourisp.com proto pop3 user login_name password your_passwd</EM>
<P><EM>user login_name with pass your_passwd is login_name here</EM>
<P>All you have to do is replace <EM>mail.yourisp.com</EM> with the name of
the mail server of your ISP, <EM>your_passwd</EM> with your password, and
<EM>login_name</EM> with your login name. 
<P>An important thing to note. For Pine and this procedure to work correctly,
your login name must corrospond with the login name you use on your ISP.
That is your local login name must match the one you use on your server,
and your e-mail address.
<P>Next, ensure that .fetchmailrc has the correct permissions (user
read/write only) and your laughing. Fetchmail can be started in two ways,
in standard mode (where it'll fetch messages from the server and
terminate), or in daemon mode (where it will stay active, and
check/download mail every X seconds). To use daemon mode, type
<I>fetchmail -a -d(Seconds between Polls)</I>. -a ensures it downloads
all mail. To use the standard mode, just type <I>fetchmail -a</I>.
<P>Next, you need to setup Pine. Open up Pine, by typing pine at your prompt,
choose Setup - Configuration. Setup your userdomain as the domain in your
e-mail address, for example jack@linux.org, would be linux.org. Next,
setup smtp-server as your POP mail server (the same you used in the
fetchmail setup). So we enter www.linux.org. If you want news, setup your
nntp server to your ISP's news server.
<P>So there you have it folks, everything should be working now. To connect
up to your ISP, just run &nbsp;/ppp-connect as root. Then, to get your e-mail
run fetchmail -a as yourself. To browse your e-mail and news, use
Pine. Install a text-based browser such as Lynx to browse the web if you
like.
