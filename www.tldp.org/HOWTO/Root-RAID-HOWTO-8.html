<P>Bohumil Chalupa's post to the linux raid list on the work 
around for the raid1 + 5 mdstop problem. His solution does not 
address the possibility of the raid device being corrupt at shutdown.
So I have added a simple status comparison to a good reference
status at boot.  This allows the operator to intervene if something
is wrong with a disk in the array. The description of this is in the
main body of this document.

Well. I have to answer myself :-)

Yes, that's it.
I had this idea in mind for some time already, but had no time to try it.
Yesterday I did, and it works. 

With my RAID1 (mirror), I don't save any checksums or raid superblock data.
I only save an information on the "real" boot partition, that the root md
volume was remounted readonly during shutdown. Then, during boot, the
linuxrc script runs mkraid --only-superblock  when it finds this
information; otherwise, it runs ckraid.
This means, that the raid superblock information is not updated during
shutdown; it's updated at the boot time. 
It is not very clean, I'm afraid,  :-(   but it works.

I'm using Slackware and initrd.md by Edward Welbon to boot the root raid
device. 
As far as I remember now, the only modified files are
mkdisk and linuxrc, and /etc/rc.d/rc.6 shutdown script.
And lilo.conf, of course.

I'm appending the important parts.
