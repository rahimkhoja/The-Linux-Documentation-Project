<P>This howto assumes you already configured your kernel to support IP 
masquerade.  See references below for information on configuring 
your kernel for a linux firewall.

<P>This setup uses a star/hub configuration.  It will set up a cipe 
connection from Machine A to Machine B and another from Machine A 
to Machine C.

eth0 is the local network (fake address) 
eth1 is the internet address (real address) 

Port A is any valid port you would like to choose 
Port B is any other valid port you would like to choose 

Key A is any valid key you would like to choose  (read cipe doc for info) 
Key B is any valid key you would like to choose

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Additional notes about scripts and the VPN</A>
</H2>

<P>The ip-up scripts currently only allow class c traffic through the cipe 
interface.  If you wish for machine B to communicate with Machine C then 
you will need to change the appropriate ip-up and ip-down scripts. 
Specifically, you need to change the ptpaddr and myaddr netmasks.  There 
are two ip-up scripts, one for ipchains and one for ipfwadm.  Same with the 
ip-down scripts.  Change the appropriate incoming, outgoing, and forwarding 
cipe interface firewall rules netmask from /24 to /16. Any cipe firewall
rule changes you make in ip-up for ipfwadm, make sure the ip-down script reflects 
the change so it will be properly removed from the list when the interface 
goes down.  For the ipchains file, anything added in a chain does not need 
ip-down reflection since ip-down will flush all the rules in the user
defined 
chain. 
<P>You will also need to uncomment the network route in the rc.cipe for Machine
B and C that adds each others network to their route table.
