> This section tries to get you up and running as soon as possible, if you can follow the steps given in this section and they work for you, you can ignore the rest of this howto. This section is updated more often then the rest of the HOWTO so will contain the most up to date information.</P

>First you need to find out if your modem is an HSF or HCF modem. You can find out from your modem by looking at it's Windows drivers or looking at the label on it's chipset, or alternatively you can download the <A
HREF="http://www.conexant.com/customer/md_driverassistance.html><citetitle>ListModem</citetitle></ulink> utility and run it to get the information.    Drivers are available for both types, but the HSF driver is further into development then the HCF driver so is likely to be more advanced for now. Expect the HCF driver to come out of beta sometime mid-year(2002).    See the following appropriate sections for quick starting with HSF and HCF modems.  </para>    <sect2 id="
