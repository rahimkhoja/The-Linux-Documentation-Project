>The LDP uses a series of scripts to transform documents into their published format. In order for these scripts to work, documents must use valid markup and include specific metadata. Metadata is information about the document and includes author information, copyright, license and a revision history of the document.</P
><P
>At this time Metadata and Markup Reviews will be conducted by
		one of the Review Coordinators and will be the final of the three
		reviews for new documents. Upon successful completion of a Metadata
		and Markup Review, the Review Coordinator will update the document's
		version number to 1.0 and submit the document for publication in the
		collection.</P

>The initial release of a document should be marked up as Version 1.0. Subsequent updates should increment the version number appropriately. The preferred format is Major.Minor.Bugfix, where each section is an integer.
    Some authors use Alan Cox style versions (for example 1.4pre-3) and some include
    additional information (for example 1.3beta). This is acceptable but not encouraged.
    The most important thing is that we <EM
>have</EM
> a version
    number so we know which version we are dealing with! Once a document goes through review it should
	 advance in minor or bugfix version number, depending on the amount of change introduced.</P
