</H2>

<P>I got the mainboard for Christmas 2001, and after a little while, I understood
that the new chipset sis735 was not handled by 
<A HREF="http://www.mandrake.com">Mandrake</A> 8.0,
<A HREF="http://www.opensound.com">OSS</A> had drivers for it that worked
but I didn't really want to pay for it, so  I looked on ALSA cvs and found that
in their latest sources they had something for the sis 7012, and a bit later I found the drivers for the sensors.
<P>It has now been 3 years I started this howto and I am always glad to get comments, advices from everywhere in the world :]
