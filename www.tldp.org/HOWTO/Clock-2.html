<H2><A NAME="s2">2. How Linux Keeps Track of Time</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Basic Strategies</A>
</H2>

<P>A Linux system actually has two clocks: One is the battery
powered &quot;Real Time Clock&quot; (also known as the
&quot;RTC&quot;, &quot;CMOS clock&quot;, or &quot;Hardware
clock&quot;) which keeps track of time when the system is turned
off but is not used when the system is running. The other is the
&quot;system clock&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;kernel
clock&quot; or &quot;software clock&quot;) which is a software
counter based on the timer interrupt. It does not exist when the
system is not running, so it has to be initialized from the RTC
(or some other time source) at boot time. References to
&quot;the clock&quot; in the <CODE>ntpd</CODE> documentation refer
to the system clock, not the RTC.
<P>The two clocks will drift at different rates, so they will
gradually drift apart from each other, and also away from the
&quot;real&quot; time. The simplest way to keep them on time is to
measure their drift rates and apply correction factors in
software. Since the RTC is only used when the system is not
running, the correction factor is applied when the clock is
read at boot time, using <CODE>clock(8)</CODE> or <CODE>hwclock(8)</CODE>.
The system clock is corrected by adjusting the rate at which the system
time is advanced with each timer interrupt, using <CODE>adjtimex(8)</CODE>.
<P>A crude alternative to <CODE>adjtimex(8)</CODE> is to have
<CODE>chron</CODE> run <CODE>clock(8)</CODE> or <CODE>hwclock(8)</CODE>
periodically to sync the system time to the (corrected) RTC. This
was recommended in the <CODE>clock(8)</CODE> man page, and it works
if you do it often enough that you don't cause large
&quot;jumps&quot; in the system time, but <CODE>adjtimex(8)</CODE>
is a more elegant solution. Some applications may complain if the
time jumps backwards.
<P>The next step up in accuracy is to use a program like
<CODE>ntpd</CODE> to read the time periodically from a network time
server or radio clock, and continuously adjust the rate of the
system clock so that the times always match, without causing
sudden &quot;jumps&quot; in the system time. If you always have a
network connection at boot time, you can ignore the RTC
completely and use <CODE>ntpdate</CODE> (which comes with the
<CODE>ntpd</CODE> package) to initialize the system clock from a
time server-- either a local server on a LAN, or a remote server
on the internet. But if you sometimes don't have a network
connection, or if you need the time to be accurate during the
boot sequence before the network is active, then you need to
maintain the time in the RTC as well.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Potential Conflicts</A>
</H2>

<P>It might seem obvious that if you're using a program like
<CODE>ntpd</CODE>, you would want to sync the RTC to the (corrected)
system clock. But this turns out to be a bad idea if the system
is going to stay shut down longer than a few minutes, because it
interferes with the programs that apply the correction factor to
the RTC at boot time.
<P>If the system runs 24/7 and is always rebooted immediately
whenever it's shut down, then you can just set the RTC from the
system clock right before you reboot. The RTC won't drift enough
to make a difference in the time it takes to reboot, so you don't
need to know its drift rate.
<P>Of course the system may go down unexpectedly, so some versions
of the kernel sync the RTC to the system clock every 11 minutes
if the system clock has been adjusted by another program. The RTC
won't drift enough in 11 minutes to make any difference, but if
the system is down long enough for the RTC to drift
significantly, then you have a problem: the programs that apply
the drift correction to the RTC need to know <EM>*exactly*</EM>
when it was last reset, and the kernel doesn't record that
information anywhere.
<P>Some unix &quot;traditionalists&quot; might wonder why anyone
would run a linux system less than 24/7, but some of us run
dual-boot systems with another OS running some of the time, or
run Linux on laptops that have to be shut down to conserve
battery power when they're not being used. Other people just
don't like to leave machines running unattended for long periods
of time (even though we've heard all the arguments in favor of
it). So the &quot;every 11 minutes&quot; feature becomes a bug.
<P>This &quot;feature/bug&quot; appears to behave differently in
different versions of the kernel (and possibly in different
versions of <CODE>xntpd</CODE> and <CODE>ntpd</CODE> as well), so if
you're running both <CODE>ntpd</CODE> and <CODE>hwclock</CODE> you may
need to test your system to see what it actually does. If you
can't keep the kernel from resetting the RTC, you might have to
run without a correction factor on the RTC.
<P>The part of the kernel that controls this can be found in
<CODE>/usr/src/linux-2.0.34/arch/i386/kernel/time.c</CODE>
(where the version number in the path will be the version of the
kernel you're running). If the variable <CODE>time_status</CODE> is
set to <CODE>TIME_OK</CODE> then the kernel will write the system
time to the RTC every 11 minutes, otherwise it leaves the RTC
alone. Calls to <CODE>adjtimex(2)</CODE> (as used by <CODE>ntpd</CODE>
and <CODE>timed</CODE>, for example) may turn this on. Calls to
<CODE>settimeofday(2)</CODE> will set <CODE>time_status</CODE> to
<CODE>TIME_UNSYNC</CODE>, which tells the kernel not to adjust the
RTC. I have not found any real documentation on this.
<P>I've heard reports that some versions of the kernel may have
problems with &quot;sleep modes&quot; that shut down the CPU to
save energy. The best solution is to keep your kernel up to date,
and refer any problems to the people who maintain the kernel.
<P>If you get bizarre results from the RTC you may have a hardware
problem. Some RTC chips include a lithium battery that can run
down, and some motherboards have an option for an external
battery (be sure the jumper is set correctly). The same battery
maintains the CMOS RAM, but the clock takes more power and is
likely to fail first. Bizarre results from the system clock may
mean there is a problem with interrupts.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Should the RTC use Local Time or UTC, and What About DST?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux &quot;system clock&quot; actually just counts the
number of seconds past Jan 1, 1970, and is always in UTC (or GMT,
which is technically different but close enough that casual users
tend to use both terms interchangeably). UTC does not change as
DST comes and goes-- what changes is the <EM>conversion</EM> between UTC
and local time. The translation to local time is done by
library functions that are linked into the application programs.
<P>This has two consequences: First, any application that needs
to know the local time also needs to know what time zone you're
in, and whether DST is in effect or not (see the next section for
more on time zones). Second, there is no provision in the kernel to
change either the system clock or the RTC as DST comes and goes,
because UTC doesn't change. Therefore, machines that only run
Linux should have the RTC set to UTC, not local time.
<P>However, many people run dual-boot systems with other OS's that
expect the RTC to contain the local time, so <CODE>hwclock</CODE>
needs to know whether your RTC is in local time or UTC, which it
then converts to seconds past Jan 1, 1970 (UTC). This still does
not provide for seasonal changes to the RTC, so the change must
be made by the other OS (this is the one exception to the rule
against letting more than one program change the time in the RTC).
<P>Unfortunately, there are no flags in the RTC or the CMOS RAM to
indicate standard time vs DST, so each OS stores this information
someplace where the other OS's can't find it. This means that
<CODE>hwclock</CODE> must assume that the RTC always contains the
correct local time, even if the other OS has not been run since
the most recent seasonal time change.
<P>If Linux is running when the seasonal time change occurs, the
system clock is unaffected and applications will make the
correct conversion. But if linux has to be rebooted for any
reason, the system clock will be set to the time in the RTC,
which will be off by one hour until the other OS (usually
Windows) has a chance to run.
<P>There is no way around this, but Linux doesn't crash very often,
so the most likely reason to reboot on a dual-boot system is to
run the other OS anyway. But beware if you're one of those people
who shuts down Linux whenever you won't be using it for a while--
if you haven't had a chance to run the other OS since the last
time change, the RTC will be off by an hour until you do.
<P>Some other documents have stated that setting the RTC to UTC
allows Linux to take care of DST properly. This is not really
wrong, but it doesn't tell the whole story-- as long as you don't
reboot, it does not matter which time is in the RTC (or even if
the RTC's battery dies). Linux will maintain the correct time
either way, until the next reboot. In theory, if you only reboot
once a year (which is not unreasonable for Linux), DST could come
and go and you'd never notice that the RTC had been wrong for
several months, because the system clock would have stayed
correct all along. But since you can't predict when you'll want
to reboot, it's better to have the RTC set to UTC if you're not
running another OS that requires local time.
<P>The Dallas Semiconductor RTC chip (which is a drop-in replacement
for the Motorola chip used in the IBM AT and clones) actually has
the ability to do the DST conversion by itself, but this feature
is not used because the changeover dates are hard-wired into the
chip and can't be changed. Current versions change on the first
Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, but earlier
versions used different dates (and obviously this doesn't work in
countries that use other dates). Also, the RTC is often
integrated into the motherboard's &quot;chipset&quot; (rather
than being a separate chip) and I don't know if they all have
this ability.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 How Linux keeps Track of Time Zones</A>
</H2>

<P>You probably set your time zone correctly when you
installed Linux. But if you have to change it for some reason, or
if the local laws regarding DST have changed (as they do
frequently in some countries), then you'll need to know how to
change it. If your system time is off by some exact number of
hours, you may have a time zone problem (or a DST problem).
<P>Time zone and DST information is stored in
<CODE>/usr/share/zoneinfo</CODE> (or
<CODE>/usr/lib/zoneinfo</CODE> on older systems).
The local time zone is determined by a symbolic link from
<CODE>/etc/localtime</CODE> to one of these files.
The way to change your timezone is to change the link.
If your local DST dates have changed, you'll have to edit the
file.
<P>You can also use the <CODE>TZ</CODE> environment variable to change
the current time zone, which is handy of you're logged in
remotely to a machine in another time zone. Also see the man
pages for <CODE>tzset</CODE> and <CODE>tzfile</CODE>.
<P>This is nicely summarized at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html</A><H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 The Bottom Line</A>
</H2>

<P>If you don't need sub-second accuracy, <CODE>hwclock(8)</CODE> and
<CODE>adjtimex(8)</CODE> may be all you need. It's easy to get
enthused about time servers and radio clocks and so on, but I ran
the old <CODE>clock(8)</CODE> program for years with excellent results.
On the other hand, if you have several machines on a LAN it can be
handy (and sometimes essential) to have them automatically sync
their clocks to each other. And the other stuff can be fun to
play with even if you don't really need it.
<P>On machines that only run Linux, set the RTC to UTC (or GMT).
On dual-boot systems that require local time in the RTC, be aware
that if you have to reboot Linux after the seasonal time change,
the clock may be temporarily off by one hour, until you have a
chance to run the other OS. If you run more than two OS's, be
sure only one of them is trying to adjust for DST.
