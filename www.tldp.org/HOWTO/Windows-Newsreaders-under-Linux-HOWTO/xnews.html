>2.1.1. Configuring Wine for Xnews</H3
><P
>&#13;Wine is capable of "emulating" many different versions of Windows. 
Wine is not perfect, however; it runs slower than a normal Windows installation
and it is not a stable product. Certain problems occur when running Xnews; 
these are discussed in the 
"<A
HREF="xnews.html#x-problems"
><I
>Problems and Issues</I
></A
>" section of 
the document.
</P
><P
>&#13;Before Xnews can run under Linux, certain files from a Windows installation 
need to be copied to the Xnews root directory. Depending on which version of 
Windows you have access to, there will be different files to copy and different
instructions for configuring Wine. This document currently covers a Windows 
98SE/Windows ME and a Windows XP configuration. A Windows 98SE/Windows ME 
configuration is preferred, since there are some more problems with a Windows 
XP configuration. Below are the instructions describing how to configure Wine 
for Xnews.

impossible to close the Xnews window, and there is no "Exit" option 
in the main menu. To get around this, make sure that the window is sized so 
that the terminal used to launch Xnews is accessible, and close that
terminal.  Do not press 
<B

>Ctrl</B

sure to click the Save button to save the newsrc first.

files are used.

HREF="http://www.winehq.com/hypermail/wine-devel/2003/07/0476.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Wine
mailing list message</A
>, there are certain un-"emulated" 
functions in Windows XP "emulation." Version 1.1 of this document was
updated with new files to copy and configure when using Windows 98SE 
"emulation" in order to solve this problem. Until the Wine developers
implement these Windows XP functions, use a Windows 98SE configuration to get 
around this issue. If a Windows 98SE computer is not available, just apply 
changes and look at the main window.

>&#13;When you try and copy a Web link to the clipboard, it may not copy. This
occurs when the link as a whole is copied rather than selected text. The
solution to this is to make sure that as you are selecting the text, the rest
of the link is not automatically selected. If this continues, select the blank
space before the link and copy with the preceding blank space.

>&#13;Event sounds in Xnews do not currently work. Updated instructions for this may 
be included in future versions of this document. 
</P
><P
>&#13;UPDATED (version 2.11): Event sounds work properly. If you run KDE, you first 
need to turn off the aRts soundserver by going into Settings -&#62; Control 
Center -&#62; Sounds &#38; Multimedia -&#62; Sound System and unchecking 
"Start aRts soundserver on KDE Startup" (instructions were tested on 
version 3.1.3; may be different for other versions). Note that this will 
disable event sounds for KDE applications which depend on the aRts soundserver.
Xnews sounds work properly under the Gnome sound server.

would be is colored black. Ignore this, since the correct XFace is being posted
anyway. Try to use Wine version 20030813 if you can.
