<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Scripting Language: pros and cons</A></H2>

<P>
<P>To understand the importance and the future of Tcl/Tk I strongly suggest
to point your web browser at the URL
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/people/john.ousterhout/">www.scriptics .com/people/john.ousterhout/</A>
by 
<A HREF="mailto:ouster@scriptics.com">John K. Ousterhout </A>. You
will read about the importance and the comparison between scripting (in langua
ges
such as Tcl) and system programming (in languages such as C and Java).
<P>To read a document about comparisons see
<A HREF="TclTk-HOWTO-8.html#prosandcons">the comparison discussion</A>.
<P>Here's a summary of the most important pros and cons about Tcl/Tk.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Some of the most common complaints about Tcl</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Tcl is interpreted</H3>

<P>
<P>The data is primarily treated as strings, programs written in Tcl are slow.
Tcl 8.x attempts to address this by doing some degree of compilation as well
as permitting additional variable types.
<H3>Several characteristics are not intuitive</H3>

<P>
<P>Comments are commands rather than traditional comments, numbers beginning
with 0 are octal, proper use of quoting mechanisms, etc. These aspects are
covered in the various FAQs.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Some of the most pros about Tcl</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>It is a high-level scripting language</H3>

<P>
<P>You need to write a lot less code to get your job done, especially when
compared to Motif or Win32 applications. In general, the number of Line Of
Code (LOC) of a software project is one of the most important complexity index
es.
<P>
<H3>Tcl is free</H3>

<P>
<P>You can get the sources for free over the Internet from Scriptics Download
Page or from the FTP site for Tcl.
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/software/download.html">The software c ore site</A>
includes the source code version, as well as binary versions for Windows and
Macintosh platforms; or, you can get Tcl on a number of CD-ROMs for a nominal
cost.
<P>Read about Tcl and Tk core free at
<A HREF="www.scriptics.com/about/news/qa.html">www.scriptics.com/about/n ews/qa.html</A> .
<H3>It runs on many platforms</H3>

<P>
<P>Versions exist for UNIX (Linux... of course), Windows and Macintosh. Except
for a few platform differences, your Tcl scripts will run the same way on all
systems.
<H3>It is interpreted</H3>

<P>
<P>You can execute your code directly, without compiling and linking (though
Tcl compilers are available).
<H3>It is extensible</H3>

<P>
<P>It's easy to add your own commands to extend the Tcl language. You can
write your commands in C or Tcl.
<H3>It is embeddable in your applications</H3>

<P>
<P>The Tcl interpreter is merely a set of C functions that you can call from
your code. This means you can use Tcl as an application language, much like
a macro language for a spreadsheet application.
<H3>Tcl/Tk is Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant</H3>
