<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Configuring your Linux machine as an NCP client.</A></H2>

<P>If you are a user of a mixed technology network that comprises both IP and IPX
protocols it is likely that at some time or another you have wanted to have
your Linux machine access data stored on a Novell fileserver on your
network. Novell have long offered an NFS server package for their
fileservers that would allow this, but if you are a small site or have only
a small number of people interested in doing this it is difficult to justify
the cost of the commercial package.
<P>Volker Lendecke <CODE>&lt;lendecke@namu01.gwdg.de></CODE> has written a Linux
filesystem kernel module that supports a subset of the Novell NCP
that will allow you to mount Novell volumes into your Linux filesystem
without requiring any additional products for your fileserver.
Volker has called the package <EM>ncpfs</EM> and derived the necessary
information mainly from the book "Netzwerkprogrammierung in C" by
Manfred Hill and Ralf Zessin (further details of the book are contained within
the README file in the <EM>ncpfs</EM> package).
<P>The software causes Linux to emulate a normal Novell workstation for file
services. It also includes a small print utility that allows you to print to
Novell print queues (This is documented in the Print Client section later).
The <EM>ncpfs</EM> package will work with Novell fileservers of version 3.x and
later, it will not work the Novell 2.x. The <EM>ncpfs</EM> client will also work
with close Novell compatible products, but unfortunately some products that
claim to be compatible aren't compatible enough. To use <EM>ncpfs</EM> with Novell
4.x fileservers, it is preferred to use the Novell server in <EM>bindery</EM>
emulation mode. The NDS support is a very recent early beta addition to
<EM>ncpfs</EM> and additionally its use may be prohibited in your country due to
the inclusion of patented technology. 
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Obtaining <B><EM>ncpfs</EM></B>.</A>
</H2>

<P>The latest <EM>ncpfs</EM> package was designed to be built against the version
<CODE>1.2.13</CODE> kernel or kernels later than <CODE>1.3.71</CODE> (this includes 2.x.x).
If you not using a kernel in either of these categories then you will have
to upgrade your kernel. The
<A HREF="Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel-HOWTO</A> describes how to do this in
detail.
<P>You can obtain the <EM>ncpfs</EM> package by anonymous ftp from
Volker's home site at:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/">ftp.gwdg.de</A>
or
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ncpfs">sunsite.unc.edu</A> 
or mirror sites. The current version at the time of writing was:
<P><CODE>ncpfs-2.0.11.tgz</CODE> or <CODE>ncpfs-2.2.0.tgz</CODE> which adds the NDS support.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Building <B><EM>ncpfs</EM></B> for kernel 1.2.13.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Build a kernel with Ethernet and IPX support</B><DD><P>The first thing you
need to do is ensure that your kernel has been built with IPX support enabled.
In the <CODE>1.2.13</CODE> version kernel you need only ensure that you have
answered <CODE>Y</CODE> to the question: '<CODE>The IPX protocol</CODE>' as
illustrated:
<PRE>
 ...
 ...
Assume subnets are local (CONFIG_INET_SNARL) [y] 
Disable NAGLE algorithm (normally enabled) (CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OFF) [n] 
The IPX protocol (CONFIG_IPX) [n] y
*
* SCSI support
 ...
 ...
</PRE>

You will also need to ensure that you include an appropriate driver for your
Ethernet card. If you do not know how to do this then you should read the
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet-HOWTO</A>.
<P>You can then proceed to build your kernel. Make sure you remember to run
<EM>lilo</EM> to install it when you have finished.
<P>
<DT><B>Untar the <EM>ncpfs</EM> software</B><DD><P>
<PRE>
# cd /usr/src
# tar xvfz ncpfs-2.0.11.tgz
# cd ncpfs
</PRE>
<P>
<DT><B>Check the Makefile</B><DD><P>If you intend to use <EM>kerneld</EM> to
autoload the <EM>ncpfs</EM> kernel module then you must uncomment the
line in the <CODE>Makefile</CODE> that refers to: <CODE>KERNELD</CODE>. If you
are unsure what this means then you should read the
<A HREF="Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel-HOWTO</A> to familiarise
yourself with kernel module configuration.
<P>
<DT><B>Make the <EM>ncpfs</EM> software</B><DD><P>The software should compile cleanly
with no other configuration necessary:
<PRE>
# make
</PRE>
<P>
<DT><B>Copy the IPX tools somewhere useful if you don't already have them.</B><DD><P>After the <EM>make</EM> has completed you should find all of the tools
you need in the <CODE>ncpfs/bin</CODE> directory. You can use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to install the tools in Volkers choice of directories. If you are running
on an ELF based system then you will need to rerun <CODE>`ldconfig -v'</CODE> to
ensure that the shared library is able to be found.
<P>
<DT><B>Copy the <EM>ncpfs.o</EM> module somewhere useful if necessary.</B><DD><P>If you are compiling for a <CODE>1.2.*</CODE> kernel then you will find a file
called <CODE>ncpfs.o</CODE> in the <CODE>ncpfs/bin</CODE> directory after the
<EM>make</EM> has completed. This is the <EM>ncpfs</EM> kernel module.
You should copy this somewhere useful. On my <EM>debian</EM> system I have
copied it to the <CODE>/lib/modules/1.2.13/fs</CODE> directory and added
<CODE>ncpfs</CODE> to the <CODE>/etc/modules</CODE> file so that it will be
automatically started at boot time. If you are using some other distribution
you should find where it keeps its modules and copy it there, or just copy it
to your <CODE>/etc</CODE> directory. To load the modules manually you need to use
the command:
<PRE>
# insmod ncpfs.o
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Building <B><EM>ncpfs</EM></B> for kernels 1.3.71++/2.0.*.</A>
</H2>

<P>For the latest version of <EM>ncpfs</EM> you must use kernel <CODE>1.3.71</CODE>
or newer, this includes the <CODE>2.0.*</CODE> kernels.
<P>If you intend using a kernel that is version <CODE>1.3.71</CODE> or newer then the
<EM>ncpfs</EM> kernel code has been included in the standard kernel
distribution. You need only answer <CODE>Y</CODE> to:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

    ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You will still need to follow the instructions for building for kernels
<CODE>1.2.*</CODE> so that you can build the tools but there will not be a module
file for you to install.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Configuring and using <B><EM>ncpfs</EM></B>.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Configure the IPX network software</B><DD><P>There are two ways of configuring
the IPX network software. You can manually configure all of your IPX network
information or you can choose to let the software determine for itself some
reasonable settings using the command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This should be reasonable in most circumstances, but if it doesn't work for
you then read the 'IPX tools' section above to configure your software
manually. Problems have been noted using this on networks containing
Windows '95 clients.
<P>
<DT><B>Test the configuration</B><DD><P>After your IPX network is configured you
should be able to use the <EM>slist</EM> command to see a list of all of
the Novell fileserver on your network:
<PRE>
# slist
</PRE>

If the slist command displays a message like:
<CODE>ncp_connect: Invalid argument</CODE> then your kernel probably does not
support IPX. Check that you have actually booted off the appropriate kernel.
When you boot you should see messages about '<CODE>IPX</CODE>' and '<CODE>ncpfs</CODE>' in
the system startup messages. If the <EM>slist</EM> command does not list all
of your fileservers then you may need to use the manual network configuration
method.
<P>
<DT><B>Mount a Novell(tm) server or volume.</B><DD><P>If your IPX network software
is working
ok you should now be able to mount a Novell fileserver or volume into your
Linux filesystem. The <EM>ncpmount</EM> command is used for this purpose
and requires that you specify at least the following information:
<OL>
<LI>The fileserver name</LI>
<LI>(optionally) The fileserver directory to mount</LI>
<LI>The fileserver login id. If it has a password you will also need that.</LI>
<LI>The mount point ie. where you want the mount to go. This will be an
existing directory on your machine.</LI>
</OL>
<P>There is an equivalent <EM>ncpumount</EM> command to unmount a mounted NCP
filesystem. The NCP filesystems will be unmounted cleanly if you shutdown
your machine normally, so you needn't worry about <EM>ncpumount</EM>ing your
filesystems manually before a <EM>halt</EM> or <EM>shutdown</EM>.
<P>An example command to mount fileserver <CODE>ACCT_FS01</CODE>, with a login id of 
<CODE>guest</CODE> with no password, under the <CODE>/mnt/Accounts</CODE> directory
might look like the following:
<PRE>
# ncpmount -S ACCT_FS01 /mnt/Accounts -U guest -n
</PRE>

Note the use of the <CODE>-n</CODE> option to indicate that no password is
required for the login. The same login specifying a password of <CODE>secret</CODE>
would look like:
<PRE>
# ncpmount -S ACCT_FS01 /mnt/Accounts -U guest -P secret
</PRE>

If you don't specify either the <CODE>-n</CODE> or the <CODE>-P</CODE> options you
will be prompted for a password.
<P>
<DT><B>Check the mount</B><DD><P>If the mount is successful you will find all the
volumes accessible to the userid used for login listed as directories under
the mount point. You should then also be able to traverse the directory
structure to find other files. You may alternatively use the <CODE>-V</CODE> option
to mount a single volume.
<P>NCP does not provide uid or gid ownership of files. All the files will have
the permission and ownership assigned to the mount point directory restricted
by trustee permissions on the Novell server. Bear this in mind when sharing
mounts between Linux users.
<P>
<DT><B>Configure mounts to be automatically performed.</B><DD><P>If you have some
need to permanently have an ncp mount then you will want to configure the
commands above into your <EM>rc</EM> files so that they occur automatically
at boot time. If your distribution doesn't already provide some way of
configuring IPX like debian then I recommend you place them in your
<CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE> file if you have one. You might use something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#
# Start the ncp filesystem

/sbin/insmod /lib/modules/1.2.13/fs/ncpfs.o

# configure the IPX network
ipx_configure --auto_interface=on --auto_primary=on

# guest login to the Accounting fileserver
ncpmount -S ACCT_FS01 /mnt/Accounts -U guest -n

#
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

There is another means of configuring NCP mounts and that is by building
a <CODE>$HOME/.nwclient</CODE> file. This file contains details of temporary
or user specific NCP mounts that would be performed regularly. It allows
you to store the details of mounts so that you can recreate them without
having to specify all of the detail each time.
<P>Its format is quite straightforward:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# The first entry is the 'preferred server' entry and is
# used whenever you do not specify a server explicitly.
#
# User TERRY login to DOCS_FS01 fileserver with password 'password'
DOCS_FS01/TERRY password
#
# Guest login to the ACCT_FS01 fileserver with no password.
ACCT_FS01/GUEST -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To activate these mounts you could use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ncpmount /home/terry/docs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to mount: DOCS_FS01 with a login of TERRY under the /home/terry/docs
directory. Note that this entry was chosen because no fileserver was
specified in the mount command. If the following command were used:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ncpmount -S ACCT_FS01 /home/terry/docs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

then a GUEST login to ACCT_FS01 would be mounted there instead.
<P><B>Note:</B> for this mechanism to work the permissions of the
<CODE>$HOME/.nwclient</CODE> file must be <CODE>0600</CODE> so you would
need to use the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ chmod 0600 $HOME/.nwclient
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If non-root users are to be allowed to use this mechanism then
the <EM>ncpmount</EM> command must be Set Userid Root, so you
would need to give it permissions:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chmod 4755 ncpmount
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DT><B>Try out the <EM>nsend</EM> utility</B><DD><P>a utility to send messages
to Novell users is also included in the package, it is called <EM>nsend</EM>
and is used as follows:
<PRE>
# nsend rod hello there
</PRE>

would send the message "hello there" to a logged in user "rod" on your
"primary" fileserver (the first one appearing in your <CODE>.nwclient</CODE>
file. You can specify another fileserver with the same syntax as for the
<EM>ncpmount</EM> command.
