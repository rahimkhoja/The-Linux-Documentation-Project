>Open your current XF86Config file and scroll down to the Monitor Section.  You want to copy the following sections from the device specific XF86Config backup files you created above : Monitor, Device, Screen.  These sections should go in your XF86Config file after the coresponding section in the file you have open.  As you copy each section make certain that the Identifier is unique for each section,  you will reference these Identifiers later.</P
><P
>Clear as Mud Right?  You should now have a Monitor Section, a Device Section,  and a Screen Section for EACH video card/monitor combination, each Section should have a unique Identifier.  If you are still confused reread the prior paragraph.  If that doesn't help, look at <A

The ServerLayour Section is exactally that,  it tells you what Screens to use, how to lay them out logically, and what input devices to assign to them.  Your current layout is for one screen, keyboard, and mouse.  For each Screen section you have created about you need reference in this section for them to appear in your display.</P
