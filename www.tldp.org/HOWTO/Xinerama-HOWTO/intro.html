>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>Why do you need Xinerama ? And what is it ? The Xinerama extensions were introduced to the XFree86 system in version 4.0.  Xinerama is an extension to XFree86 Release 6 Version 4.0 (X4.0) which allows applications and window managers to use the two (or more) physical displays as one large virtual display. </P
><P
>The beauty of the Xinerama extensions is that they are totally transparent to user space.  Previously,  applications could only reside on one of the displays and could not be moved between the two.  Window managers had to be specially written to support the two displays.  With Xinerama, window managers and applications don't have to be specially written to support the larger "Virtual Desktop" which Xinerama creates.</P
