    LAN (EAPOL). The Authenticator re-encapsulates the EAP messages to
    RADIUS format, and passes them to the Authentication Server. 
    </P

>&#13;    During authentication, the Authenticator just relays packets
    between the Supplicant and the Authentication Server. When the
    authentication process finishes, the Authentication Server sends a
