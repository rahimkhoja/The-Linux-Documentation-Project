<P>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a client/server protocol that allows a
user to transfer files to and from a remote network site. It works with TCP
and is most commonly used on the Internet, although it can also be used on a
LAN.
<P>
<P>An FTP site is a computer that is running FTP server software (also known
an FTP daemon, or <CODE>ftpd</CODE>). A public ftp site can usually be accessed
by anybody by logging in as <CODE>anonymous</CODE> or <CODE>ftp</CODE>. There are
many excellent public ftp sites that make repositories of free Unix software
available. By learning how to use FTP, you give yourself access to an
indespensible resource.
<P>
<P>Private FTP sites require a user name or password. If you have a shell
account with your ISP, you may be able to access your files via FTP (contact
your system administrator to check on this).
<P>
<P>An FTP client is the userland application that provides access to FTP
servers. There are many FTP clients available. Some are graphical, and some
are text-based. 
<P>
<P>FTP was first developed by the University of California, Berkeley for
inclusion in 4.2BSD (Berkeley Unix). The RFC (Request for Comments) is
available at
