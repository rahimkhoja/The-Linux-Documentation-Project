      files, including links.</P
><P
>However, you don't want to copy the directory 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/new-disk</TT

      would copy the new disk to itself!</P

>Furthermore, you want to create the

      but you don't want to copy its contents: 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>virtual</I

      files, but rather contains information on the processes running on the
      system.</P

>Here are three different ways to copy the old disk to the new
      one. This may take quite a while, especially if you have a large disk or
      little memory. You can expect to be able to copy 10 Mb per minute, and
      possibly much more.</P
><P
>You can follow the copy's progress by using the command
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>df</B

      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>watch df</B
>  or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>watch ls -l /new-disk</B

      to see a report updated every two seconds; press <B

CLASS="KEYCAP"

      to end the display. Be aware that running the 
      <B

	    you want to copy.</P
><P
>With this method only, if there are any files in the root
	    directory itself, you need another command to copy them. In
	    particular, this is required with Debian and Slackware, since these
	    distributions put files in the root directory:

      a bug. There are of course many other ways to copy the disks, but these
      three are the simplest, quickest, and most reliable.</P
><P
