></H1
><P
>   It is important to understand how a SLIP/PPP emulator works in
   general, to be aware of its limitations. First, you do not need to install
   the emulator on your machine. It runs on your remote host only. What you
   need on your machine is the TCP/IP and SLIP or PPP protocols installed in 
   your kernel (more on that in a bit), and some clients.
  </P
><P
>   Here's what happens: you send network requests from your machine
   to your remote host over the SLIP/PPP link. The emulator grabs them and
   sends them out to the Net at large. Then, incoming data is sent back from
   the Net to your account on the remote host, where the emulator grabs it
   and sends it back over the SLIP/PPP link to your machine. So, to the Net
   it appears as if you are working out of your account on the remote host,
   but to you it looks like you are really connected right to the Net.
  </P
><P
>   As you can see, this can confuse stuff that is incoming from the
   Net. For example, talk doesn't work via an emulator, because the incoming 
   talk request tries to start the remote hosts talk daemon, not yours.
  </P
><P
>   The other big difference between an emulator and real SLIP/PPP is
   you are NOT assigned your own IP address; remember, you are only
   converting a dialup account to a SLIP/PPP connection.

    was written by the fine folks at marketplace.com. They have 
    quit working on it now, and consider it a 'mature' product. The last 
    version is 2.05; if you are going to use TIA, please get this version.

>    This is a freeware application, covered under the GNU Public 
    License. It is out of beta, and is real stable. It sports a few more 
    features than TIA, and is (reportedly) easier on host resources. 
    Available at fine Linux FTP sites everywhere.

><P
>    If you don't have root access to your machine for one reason or
    another, and you can't persuade someone who does to install SLIP and dip,
    then you won't have much choice except to use Term. If you want to know
    more about Term, please read the HOWTO on Sunsite.

>2.4. What about real SLIP/PPP?</A
></H2
><P
>    Hey, a lot of places are offering real SLIP/PPP at reasonable 
    prices for non-dedicated dialup nowadays. If you can afford it, or feel 
    the need, go for it. The Real Thing is always better than emulation. 
    However, one of the things an emulator provides is security; it acts as 
    an impregnable firewall, and with it you are pretty much as bulletproof 
    as your provider is. You'll pay for it though, emulation is slower, and 
    does not fully support every protocol. Still and all, emulation is good 
    enough for most people, and is a fine way to connect to the Net.
