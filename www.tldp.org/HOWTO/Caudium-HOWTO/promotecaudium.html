>&#13;      Caudium, and Roxen problems are not technical. Instead, they are
      advertising and marketing. Caudium needs to become
      recognized. It could the best product in the world, but if
      nobody knows, it will not be used. To help Caudium to become
      recognized for its quality there are some simple things we can
      do together:

>&#13;	  Try it, and give us feedback about your experience. 
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	   Write some documentation. Without documentation, a project is useless.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	  Recommend Caudium to some people you know. You don't really have to tell
	  them to try it now or they will die, just tell him about it. If other
	  people tell them the same thing, chances are that they will install it.
	  When these people install Caudium, they will look for documentation.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	   Mention Caudium in newsgroups/web sites telling them what you think of it.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	   Translate documentation.
	</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;      If you do this, you will help promote Caudium's
      success. Remember, one of Caudium disadvantages is that the
      community is too small right now.

      don't have lot of time, and/or are not technically minded.
