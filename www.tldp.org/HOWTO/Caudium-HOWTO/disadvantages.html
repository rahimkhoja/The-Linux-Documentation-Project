>&#13;         Too small of a community, and quite unknown in web server world. One example of the problem you may have is if you write Pike code for Caudium, and your hosting company doesn't support Pike, and you don't have root access to your server. Of course, it is possible to compile Pike on your account and run Caudium without the superuser privileges.

>&#13;        CGI performance on busy CGI based sites was lackluster -- no one will take the time to rewrite CGIs.  This seems to be somewhat resolved with Pike 7.2/Caudium 1.2.

>&#13;          Webmasters like to use mod_rewrite in the .htaccess files to protect their sites from leeching, etc. Yes, there is referrerdeny and browserdeny, but these are accessible to the System Administrator, not the casual web user.  On Apache, one can easily specify rules on a per directory basis.  This isn't easy in Caudium, however, it is rare that someone would have more than two or three different conditions.

>&#13;          Now, for people that are running their own server, many of these issues disappear.  Administration and adding servers is much easier.  I'm not sure I agree with the templates, but perhaps an Apache Template could be tweaking beyond that to the System Administrator.  In most cases, Apache has SSI turned on for shtml files -- getting the exec command enabled to mimic this in Caudium is not a task for the beginner.  The maze of options to find that one setting will certainly frustrate anyone getting started.

>&#13;        A graphical interface is not always the best. To create a virtual server with Apache, you have to copy and paste five lines. If you use the Caudium Interface it will take you more than one minute. And if you want to change Caudium text file directly, you will have to write sed script.
