<P>If you decide to take a turn at advocating commercial software
ports to Linux, remember that in so doing you're not acting as
merely one individual, but as a representative of our entire
community.  I know we're more honest than Microsoft; I like to
think we're less self-satisfied than Apple; I hope we're more
generous in helping other users in need than any of the other
user communities.  Show those qualities to the companies you
contact--honesty, humility, and helpfulness--and you stand a good
chance of being successful.
