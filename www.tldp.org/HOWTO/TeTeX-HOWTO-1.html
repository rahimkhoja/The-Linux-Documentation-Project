</H2>

<P>TeX handles only the formatting part of the document preparation.
Generating output from TeX is like compiling source code into object
code, which still needs to be linked.  You prepare an input file with
a text editor----what most people think of as ``word processing''---
and format the input file document with TeX to produce a
device-independent output file, called a <CODE>.dvi</CODE> file.
<P>You also need a program or two to translate TeX's <CODE>.dvi</CODE> output
for your screen and printer.  These programs are collectively known as
``dviware.''  For example, TeX itself only makes requests for fonts.
It is up to the <CODE>.dvi</CODE> output translator to provide the actual
font for the output regardless of whether the medium is a video screen
or paper.  This extra step may seem overly complicated, but the
abstraction allows documents to display the same on different devices
with little or no change to the original document.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>teTeX.</H3>

<P>TeX is implemented for practically every serious computer system in
the world---and quite a few ``non-serious'' ones---so implementors
must provide the installation facilities for all of them.  This
accounts in part for teTeX's complexity, in addition to the inherent
complexity of any TeX installation.  It also accounts for the fact
that installing the system yourself is a significant task, and unless
you are already familiar with TeX, it is easy to get lost in the
numerous executable programs, TeX files, documentation, and fonts.
<P>Fortunately, teTeX is part of the GNU/Linux distribution. You can
install the package much more easily using GNU/Linux installation
tools. You may already have teTeX installed on your system.  If so,
you can skip ahead to Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-2.html#sec-using">Using teTeX</A>.
<P>However, if you want to install the package, the archives necessary
for a workable teTeX installation are on the CTAN archive network.
There is a list of these sites in Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-8.html#ctan-list">CTAN site list</A>.
<P>CTAN is the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network, a series of anonymous
FTP sites that archive TeX programs, macros, fonts, and documentation.
In the course of using TeX you'll probably become familiar with at
least one CTAN site.  In this document, a pathname like
<CODE>~CTAN/contrib/pstricks</CODE> means ``look in the directory
<CODE>contrib/pstricks</CODE> of your nearest CTAN site.'' 
<P>The installation of the generic teTeX distribution described in
Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-9.html#ctan-install">Installing the CTAN teTeX distribution</A> concentrates on the Intel versions of Linux.
Installing teTeX on other hardware should require only substituting
the appropriate executable program archive in the installation
process.
<P>In addition to the executable programs, the distribution includes all
of the TeX and LaTeX package, <CODE>metafont</CODE> and its sources,
<CODE>bibtex, makeindex,</CODE> and <EM>all</EM> of the
documentation... more than 4 megabytes' worth.  The documentation
covers everything you will forseeably need to know to get started.
So, you should install all of the documents.  Not only will you
eventually read them, the documents themselves provide many examples
of ``live'' TeX and LaTeX code.
<P>TeX was written by Professor Donald Knuth of Stanford University.  It
is a lower-level typesetting language for all of the higher-level
packages like LaTeX.  Essentially, LaTeX is a set of TeX macros that
provide convenient, predefined document formats for end users.  If you
like the formats provided by LaTeX, you may never need to learn
bare-bones TeX programming.  The difference between the two languages
is like the difference between assembly language and C.  You can have
the speed and flexibility of TeX, or the convenience of LaTeX.  
<P>By the way, the letters of the word ``TeX'' are Greek,
tau-epsilon-chi.  It is not a fraternity, but the root of the Greek
word, <EM>techne,</EM> which means art and/or science.  ``TeX'' is not
pronounced like the first syllable in ``Texas.''  The <EM>chi</EM> has
no English equivalent, but TeX is generally pronounced so that it
rhymes with ``yecch,'' to use Professor Knuth's example from <EM>The
TeXBook,</EM> which is one of the standard TeX references.  When
writing, ``TeX,'' on character devices, always use the standard
capitalization, or the <CODE>\TeX{}</CODE> macro in typesetting.
<P>
<H3>Text editors.</H3>

<P>Any of the editors that work under Linux---<CODE>jed, joe, jove,
vi, vim, stevie,</CODE> Emacs, and microemacs---will work to prepare a
TeX input file, as long as the editor reads and writes plain-vanilla
ASCII text.  My preference is GNU Emacs.  There are several reasons
for this:
<UL>
<LI>You can format, preview and print documents with Emacs's 
TeX and LaTeX modes.</LI>
<LI>Emacs can automatically insert TeX-style, ``curly
quotes,'' as you type, rather than the &quot;ASCII-vanilla&quot;
kind.  </LI>
<LI>Emacs has integrated support for Texinfo, a hypertext 
documentation system.  </LI>
<LI>Emacs is widely supported.  Versions 19.34 and later, for example, 
are included in the major U.S. Linux distributions.  The most recent
version from the GNU archives is 20.3.</LI>
<LI>Emacs does everything except butter the
toast in the morning.  </LI>
<LI>Emacs is free.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><CODE>dvips</CODE>.</H3>

<P>Tomas Rokicki's <CODE>dvips</CODE> generates Postscript from a
<CODE>.dvi</CODE> file.  In addition, it runs Metafont if necessary to
generate the bit mapped fonts it needs or uses Postscript fonts for
the output.  It can also crop and resize pages and perform graphics
translations from instructions in a TeX or LaTeX file,
<P>The <CODE>dvips</CODE> program is part of the teTeX distribution.  It is
discussed fully in Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-6.html#dvips">Mixing text and graphics with &lt;tt>dvips&lt;/tt></A><P>
<H3>Fonts.</H3>

<P>Much of TeX's, and therefore LaTeX's, complexity, arises from its
implementation of various font systems, and the way these fonts are
specified.  A major improvement of LaTeX 2e over its predecessor was
the way users specify fonts, the former New Font Selection Scheme.
They're discussed in Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-4.html#characters">Characters and type styles</A>, Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-3.html#tex-font-commands">TeX Font Commands</A>, and Section 
<A HREF="TeTeX-HOWTO-7.html#postscript-fonts">Using Postscript fonts</A>.)
<P>teTeX comes distributed with about a dozen standard fonts preloaded,
which is enough to get you started.  Also provided are the font
metrics descriptions, in <CODE>.tfm</CODE> (TeX font metric) files.  To
generate the other fonts that you need, it is simply a matter of
installing the <CODE>metafont</CODE> sources.  teTeX's <CODE>.dvi</CODE>
utilities will invoke <CODE>metafont</CODE> automatically and generate the
Computer Modern fonts you need.
