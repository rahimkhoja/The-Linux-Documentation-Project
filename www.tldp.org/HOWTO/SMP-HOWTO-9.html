<LI> <B>Data Races</B>
<P>A data race happens when to processes want to modify a shared variable
concurrently without protecting themselves from the effect of the other
process. 
<P>Let A a shared variable. Let P1 and P2 two processes that access this
variable. Those two processes are making the same following operation:
"read A in tmp variable (local to the precess); do tmp = tmp + 1 ; write
tmp in A". If the A variable is not protected by a lock, resulting
executions could not correspond to what is espected. For example, here
is two examples if one do not lock A:
<PRE>
case #1:
A=0
P1: read A -> tmp1 (so tmp1 is 0)
P2: read A -> tmp2 (so tmp2 is 0)
P1: tmp1 = tmp1 + 1 (so tmp1 is 1)
P2: tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 (so tmp2 is 1)
P1: tmp1 -> write A (so A is 1)
P2: tmp2 -> write A (so A is 1)
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
case #2:
A=0
P1: read A -> tmp1 (so tmp1 is 0)
P1: tmp1 = tmp1 + 1 (so tmp1 is 1)
P1: tmp1 -> write A (so A is 1)
P2: read A -> tmp2 (so tmp2 is 1)
P2: tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 (so tmp2 is 2)
P2: tmp2 -> write A (so A is 2)
</PRE>
<P>To avoid this kind of problem, one uses a lock:
<PRE>
A=0:
P1: lock A
P1: read A -> tmp1 (so tmp1 is 0)
P2: lock A (so P2 is blocked)
P1: tmp1 = tmp1 + 1 (so tmp1 is 1)
P1: tmp1 -> write A (so A is 1)
P1: unlock A (so P2 is unblocked)
P2: read A -> tmp2 (so tmp2 is 1)
P2: tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 (so tmp2 is 2)
P2: tmp2 -> write A (so A is 2)
P2: unlock A
</PRE>
<P>
</LI>
<LI> <B>Deadlock</B>
<P>This is an inter-blocking that occurs when two processes want to access
at shared variables mutually locked. For example, let A and B two locks
and P1 and P2 two processes:
<P>
<PRE>
P1: lock A
P2: lock B
P1: lock B (so P1 is blocked by P2)
P2: lock A (so P2 is blocked by P1)
</PRE>

Process P1 is blocked because it is waiting for the unlocking of B
variable by P2. However P2 also needs the A variable to finish its
computation and free B. So we have a deadlock.
<P>In this example, the problem is very simple. But imagine what can happen
in a 2 millions of lines of code (like the linux kernel) with hundreds
of locks. :-)
