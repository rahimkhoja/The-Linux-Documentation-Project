<P><B>Documentation and tools.</B>
<P>
<P>Real Documentation exists.  Online and in print.  The reading of
several of these is required to make the step from small time DNS
admin to a big time one.  
<P>
<P>I have written <EM>The Concise Guide to DNS and BIND</EM> (by Nicolai
Langfeldt, me), published by Que (ISBN 0-7897-2273-9).  The book is
much like this HOWTO, just more details, and a lot more of everything.
It has also been translated to Polish and published as <EM>DNS i BIND</EM>
by Helion (
<A HREF="http://helion.pl/ksiazki/dnsbin.htm">http://helion.pl/ksiazki/dnsbin.htm</A>, ISBN
83-7197-446-9).  Now in 4th edition is <EM>DNS and BIND</EM> by Cricket
Liu and P. Albitz from O'Reilly &amp; Associates (ISBN 0-937175-82-X,
affectionately known as the Cricket book).  Another book is <EM>Linux
DNS Server Administration</EM>, by Craig Hunt, published by Sybex (ISBN
0782127363), I have not read it yet.  Another must for good DNS
administration (or good anything for that matter) is <EM>Zen and the
Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</EM> by Robert M. Pirsig.
<P>
<P>Online you will find my book, along with tons of other books,
available electronically as a subscription service at 
<A HREF="http://safari.informit.com/">http://safari.informit.com/</A>.  There is stuff on 
<A HREF="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/">http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/</A> (DNS Resources Directory), 
<A HREF="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">http://www.isc.org/bind.html</A>; A FAQ, a reference manual (the
ARM should be enclosed in the BIND distribution as well) as well as
papers and protocol definitions and DNS hacks (these, and most, if not
all, of the RFCs mentioned below, are also contained in the BIND
distribution).  I have not read most of these.  The newsgroup 
<A HREF="news:comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains">news:comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains</A> is about DNS.  In addition
there are a number of RFCs about DNS, the most important are probably
the ones listed here.  Those that have BCP (Best Current Practice)
numbers are <EM>highly recommended</EM>.
