<H2><A NAME="s5">5. PGP and GnuPG</A></H2>

<P>To use anyone of the versions of <EM>PGP</EM> with <EM>Mutt-i</EM>, first it will
be necesary to configure <EM>PGP</EM> properly in the way that the public keys
file (public keys ring) and the private keys file (private keys ring) will
exist. It is convenient to previously test PGP from the command line to
assure that it signs and encrypt correctly.
<P>Remember that the <EM>PGP</EM> versions that exist for <EM>Unix</EM> are <CODE>2.6.3(i)</CODE> and <CODE>5.0(i)</CODE>, that we call <B>PGP2</B> and <B>PGP5</B> respectively forward. <B>GnuPG</B> is a new encrypt system, being developed in these days, in an advanced state of development, open source and free, in many aspects better than <B>PGP</B> (see GnuPG mini howto 
<A HREF="http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto">http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto</A>).
<P>We will also clarify that <EM>PGP</EM>, as being a program developed in the
US, is restricted by certain exporting laws about programs that include
cryptographic code; this is the reason for the existance of an
international version to almost all binary versions, and it is noted with
the &quot;<B>i</B>&quot; letter (<B>pgp - pgpi</B>).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 PGP2</A>
</H2>

<P><EM>PGP2</EM> generates keys with the RSA 
<A HREF="http://www.rsa.com">http://www.rsa.com</A>,algorithm and it uses IDEA 
<A HREF="http://www.ascom.ch">http://www.ascom.ch</A> as the encryption
algorithm. Both are propietary algorithms and its use is restricted by its
respectives patents.
<P>To run it correctly, you must have it installed, as well as having a directory called <CODE>~/.pgp</CODE>, containing the configuration file <CODE>pgp-i.conf</CODE> and the private and public keys rings files, <CODE>pubring.pgp</CODE> and <CODE>secring.pgp</CODE> respectively.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 PGP5</A>
</H2>

<P>The keys generated by <EM>PGP5</EM> are <B>DSS/DH</B> (Digital Signature
Standard / Diffie-Helman). PGP5 uses <B>CAST</B>, <B>Triple-DES</B>, and
<B>IDEA</B> as encrypt algorithms. PGP5 can work with encrypted or signed
data with <EM>RSA</EM> (PGP2), and use that keys to sign or encrypt (with the
keys generated with PGP2, because PGP5 can not generate that type of
keys). In the other hand, PGP2 can not use the <EM>DSS/DH</EM> keys from
PGP5; this creates incompatibility problems, because many users continue
using PGP2 with <EM>Unix/Linux</EM>.
<P>To run PGP5 correctly, in the <CODE>~/.pgp</CODE> directory you will
have the public and private key rings (<CODE>pubring.pkr</CODE> and
<CODE>secring.skr</CODE> respectively), and the configuration file <CODE>pgp.cfg</CODE>.
<P>In the case that you have installed the both versions of <EM>PGP</EM> (PGP2
installed and configured before PGP5), we will create the configuration
file <CODE>~/.pgp/pgp.cfg</CODE> of PGP5 as a simbolic link to the
<CODE>~/.pgp/pgp-i.conf</CODE> configuration file,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
~/.pgp$ ln -s pgp-i.conf pgp.cfg
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>adding the following lines at the end of the file
<CODE>~/.pgp/pgp-i.conf</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
PubRing = "~/.pgp/pubring.pkr"
SecRing = "~/.pgp/secring.skr"
RandSeed = "~/.pgp/randseed.bin"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The files with the keys rings of the different versions can cohexist
without any problem in the same directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 GnuPG</A>
</H2>

<P><B>GnuPG</B> is a program with the same functions that the previous. The
difference with <EM>PGP</EM>, <EM>GnuPG</EM> do not uses algorithms with
restrictive patents. <EM>PGP</EM> is free for personal uses but not comercial
jobs and its development is closed. <EM>GnuPG</EM> is free to be used in any
job and it is open source, as our favorite operating system (also its
implementation and development is made mainly in <EM>Linux</EM>).
<P>The keys generated by <EM>GnuPG</EM> are of the type <B>DSA/ElGamal</B>
(<EM>Digital Signature Algorithm</EM>, also known as <EM>DSS</EM>). Is totaly
compatible with <EM>PGP</EM>, except with the use of restricted patents
algorithms <EM>RSA</EM> and <EM>IDEA</EM>. Anyway, it is posible to implement
certain compatibility with that (see GnuPG mini howto 
<A HREF="http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto">http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto</A> to get it interacting with
PGP2 and PGP5).
