></H2
><P
>CD-ROM is a read-only media. With some early kernels you could mount a
CD-ROM for read/write; attempts to write data to the CD would simple
be ignored. As of kernel version 1.1.33 this was corrected so that
CD-ROMs must be mounted read only (e.g. using the -r option to mount).</P

>6.9. Why does the disc tray open when I shut down the system?</A
></H2
><P
>The sbpcd driver supports automatically ejecting the CD when it is
unmounted. In some older kernel versions this was the default
behaviour. If you shut down the system, a mounted CD will be
unmounted, causing it to eject.</P
><P
>This feature is for convenience when changing discs. If the tray is
open when you mount or read a CD, it will also automatically be
closed.</P
><P
>I found that this caused problems with a few programs (e.g. cdplay and
workbone). As of the 1.1.60 kernel you can control this feature under
software control. A sample program is included in the sbpcd
documentation file (or use the
<A
HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~tranter/eject.html"
TARGET="_top"
>eject</A

You can also control the default behaviour by editing the kernel

>6.11. Do multi-platter CD-ROM drives work with Linux?</A
></H2
><P
>Several users have reported success with SCSI multi-disc CD-ROM
changers. You probably need to enable the "Probe all LUNs on each
SCSI device" kernel configuration option (this is not necessary if
your CD changer is already known to the SCSI-driver. Have a look at
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi.c</TT
>).</P
><P
>At least one user also had to increase a SCSI timeout value in the
kernel driver. A symptom of this is an error message like "wrong fs
type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr5, or too many mounted file
systems" when trying to mount a CD for the first time, but a second
mount immediately afterwards succeeds. To increase the timeout
increase the value of IOCTL_TIMEOUT at the beginning of
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c</TT
> and recompile the
kernel. A value of 10000 instead of the default 3000 is reported to
work with a NEC Multispin 4Xc.</P
><P
>It might be necessary to create additional block special files, so
that all LUNs can be accessed. A device file is needed for every
LUN. So for a 7 disc changer <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/sr0</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/sr6</TT

are needed (more if you have additional SCSI CD-ROM drives). To create
the block special file execute <TT

with ? being the required number.</P
><P
>The Nakamichi MBR-7 7 disc changer, NEC Multispin 4Xc and Pioneer 12
disc changer have been reported to work.</P
><P
>EIDE/ATAPI multi-disc changers are also available. The kernel has
support for some drives using the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl
function. The IDE-CD kernel driver documentation file includes source
code for a program to select changer slots, or you can use various
utilities such as the <TT

>6.15. My CD-ROM stopped working after Linux was installed</A
></H2
><P
>The usual symptom is that the boot disk used to initially install
Linux recognized your CD-ROM drive, but after Linux was installed on
the hard drive or floppy and rebooted it no longer recognizes the
CD-ROM.</P
><P
>The most common reason for this problem is that with some Linux
distributions the kernel that is installed on your hard drive (or
floppy) is not necessarily the same one that was on your boot
disk. You selected a boot disk that matched your CD-ROM hardware,
while the kernel you installed is a "generic" kernel that is lacking
CD-ROM support. You can verify this by following the troubleshooting
guidelines discussed previously in this document (e.g. start by
checking <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/devices</TT
>).</P
><P
>The solution is to recompile the kernel, ensuring that the drivers for
your CD-ROM drive and any others that are needed (e.g. SCSI
controller, ISO-9660 file system) are included. See the
<A

>If you want to write your own application, such as an audio CD player
program, you will need to understand the application programming
interface (API) provided by Linux.</P
><P
>Originally the CD-ROM kernel drivers used their own ioctl() functions
to support features specific to each drive. Header files such as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/include/linux/sbpcd.h</TT
> describe these. Because many of
the drivers were based on other drivers, the interfaces, while not
identical, have a lot in common.</P
><P
>More recently there has been an initiative headed by David van Leeuwen
(<A
HREF="mailto:david@tm.tno.nl"
TARGET="_top"
>david@tm.tno.nl</A
>) to
standardize the API for CD-ROM drives, putting common code
in one place and ensuring that all drivers exhibit the same behaviour.
This is documented in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex</TT
>.
Several kernel drivers support this. As of the 2.0 kernel all CD-ROM
drivers conform to this API.</P
