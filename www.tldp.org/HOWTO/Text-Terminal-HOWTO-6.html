<P>  See also section 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#HowTermsWorkDetail">Some Details on How Terminals Work</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="dev_names"></A> <A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.1">Device Names  </A>
 </H2>

<P> Each terminal is connected to a serial port on the host computer
(often just a PC).  The ports have names/numbers.  The first few are:
ttyS0, ttyS1, ttyS2, etc.  </P>
<P>These are represented by special files found in the /dev (device)
directory.  ttyS0) corresponds to COM1 in DOS or Windows.  ttyS1) is
COM2, etc.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-7.html#devices_">Terminal Special Files</A> for
details on these and related "devices". </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.2">Login/Logout </A>
</H2>

<P> When the host computer starts up it runs the program getty.  The
getty program runs the "login" program to log people in.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#getty_">Getty (used in /etc/inittab)</A>.  A "login:" prompt
appears on the screen.  People at the terminals and/or console log in
(after giving their passwords) and then have access to the computer.
When it's time to shut the terminal down, everyone must log off and
(and power off their terminal).  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#login_restr">Login Restrictions</A> regarding restricting logins (including allowing the
root user to log in at terminal).</P>

<H2><A NAME="half_duplex"></A> <A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.3">Half/Full Duplex </A>
 </H2>

<P>  If one watches someone typing at a terminal, the letters one
types simultaneously appear on the screen.  A naive person might think
that what one types is being sent directly from the keyboard to the
screen with a copy going to the computer (half-duplex like, see next
paragraph).  What is usually going on is that what is typed at the
keyboard is directly sent only to the host computer which in turn
echoes back to the terminal each character it receives (called
full-duplex).  In some cases (such as passwords or terse editor
commands) the typed letters are intentionally not echoed back.</P>
<P>Full-duplex means that there are two (dual) one-way communication
links.  Full-duplex is the norm for terminals.  Half-duplex is half of
a duplex, meaning that there is only a single one-way communication
link.  This link must be shared by communications going in both
directions and only one direction may be used at a time.  In this case
the computer would not be able to echo the characters you type (and
send to it) so the terminal would need to also send each character you
type directly to the terminal screen.  Some terminals have a
half-duplex mode of operation which is seldom used.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.4">Terminal Memory </A>
</H2>

<P> The image on a CRT tube will fade away almost instantly unless it
is frequently redrawn on the screen by a beam of electrons shot onto
the face of the tube.  Since text sent to a terminal needs to stay on
the screen, the image on the screen must be stored in the memory chips
of the terminal and the electron beam must repeatedly scan the screen
(say 60 times per second) to maintain the image.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#term_mem_detail">Terminal Memory Details</A> for more details.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.5">Commands for the Terminal </A>
</H2>

<P> The terminal is under the
control of the computer.  The computer not only sends the terminal
text to display on the screen but also sends the terminal commands
which are acted on.  These are 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#control_codes">Control Codes</A> (bytes) and 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#esc_seq">escape sequences</A>.  For
example, the CR (carriage return) control code moves the cursor to the
left hand edge of the screen.  A certain escape sequence (several
bytes where the first byte is the "escape" control code) can move the
cursor to the location on the screen specified by parameters placed
inside the escape sequence.</P>
<P>The 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-8.html#early_terms">first terminals</A> had only a few such
commands but modern terminals have hundreds of them.  The appearance
of the display may be changed for certain regions: such as bright,
dim, underline, blink, and reverse video.   A speaker in a terminal
can "click" when any key is pressed or beep if a mistake has occurred.
Function keys may be programmed for special meanings.  Various fonts
may exist.  The display may be scrolled up or down.  Specified parts
of the screen may be erased.  Various types of flow control may be
used to stop the flow of data when bytes are being sent to the
terminal faster than the terminal can handle them.  There are many
more as you will see from looking over an advanced terminal manual or
from the Internet links 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-22.html#esc_seq_lists">Esc Sequence List</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.6">Lack of Standardization Solved by Terminfo </A>
</H2>

<P> While terminals
made for the US all used the same ASCII code for the alphabet (except
for IBM terminals which used EBCDIC), they unfortunately did not all
use the same escape sequences.  This happened even after various ANSI
(and ISO) standards were established since these standards were never
quite advanced enough.  Furthermore, older terminals often lacked the
capabilities of newer terminals.  This might cause problems.  For
example, the computer might send a terminal an escape sequence telling
it to split the screen up into two windows of specified size, not
realizing that the terminal was incapable of doing this.</P>
<P>To overcome these problems a database called "termcap" (meaning
"terminal capabilities") was established.  Termcap was later
superceded by "terminfo".  This database resides in certain files on
the computer and has a section of it (sometimes a separate file) for
each model of terminal.  For each model (such as VT100) a list of
capabilities is provided including a list of certain escape sequences
available.  For example blink=\E5m means that to make the cursor start
blinking the terminal must be sent: Escape 5 m.  See Section 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-16.html#termcap2">Termcap and Terminfo (detailed)</A> for more
details.  Application programs may utilize this database by calling
certain C-Library functions.  One large set of such programs (over
200) is named "ncurses" and are listed in the manual page for
"ncurses" which comes with a developer's ncurses package.  There is
also a NCURSES-programming-HOWTO.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.7">The Interface </A>
</H2>

<P> The environment variable TERM is the type of
terminal Linux thinks you are using.  Most application programs use
this to look up the capabilities in the terminfo database so TERM
needs to be set correctly.   But there is more to a correct interface
than the computer knowing about the capabilities of the terminal.</P>
<P>For bytes to flow from the computer to the terminal the terminal must
be set to receive the bytes at the same baud rate (bits per second) as
they are sent out from the terminal.  If the terminal is set to
receive at 19,200 baud and the computer sends out characters at 9600
baud, only garbage (or perhaps nothing) will be seen on the screen.
One selects the baud rate for a terminal (as well as many other
features) from the terminals "set-up" menus at the terminal.  Most
terminals have a large number of options in their "set-up" menus  (see
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-14.html#term_conf_details">Terminal Set-Up (Configure) Details</A>).  The computer serial port has options also and these
options must be set up in a compatible way (see 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#comp_conf_details">Computer Set-Up (Configure) Details</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.8">Emulation</A>
</H2>

<P> Most terminals today have more than one emulation (personality or
"terminal mode").  The terminal model numbers of terminals formerly
made by DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation now Compaq) start with VT
(e.g. VT100).  Many other terminals which are not VT100 may be set up
to emulate a VT100.  Wyse was a major terminal manufacturer until
about 2005.  Most of their terminals can emulate various DEC terminals
such at VT100 and VT220.  Thus if you want to, say, use a VT320
terminal you may either use a real VT320 in "native" personality or
possibly use some other terminal capable of emulating a VT320.</P>
<P>The "native" personalities usually have more capabilities so, other
things being equal, "native" is usually the best to use.  But other
things may not be equal.  Since the Linux console emulates a VT102 it
you may want to have a terminal emulate this (or something close to it
such as VT100).  This will help insure that some programs that may not
handle terminals properly will still work OK on your terminal.  Some
programs will assume that you are using a VT102 if the program can't
find a terminfo for your terminal (or can't find a certain
capability).  Thus the failure of a program to work correctly with
your non-vt102 terminal may well be your fault if you don't provide a
good terminfo file for your terminal.  Using "native" and then
reporting any bugs will help discover and fix bugs which might not
otherwise get detected.</P>
<P>The most common type of emulation is to use a PC like it was a vt100
terminal (or the like).  Programs loaded into the PC's memory do the
emulation.  In Linux (unless you're in X Window) the PC monitor
(called the console) emulates a terminal of type "Linux" (close to
vt100).  Even certain windows within X Window emulate terminals.  See
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-10.html#term_emulation">Terminal Emulation</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc6.9">The Console</A>
</H2>

<P> On a PC, the monitor is normally the console.  It emulates a
terminal of type "Linux".  One logs on to it as a virtual terminal.
See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-7.html#console_dev">The Console</A>.  It receives messages
from the kernel regarding booting and shutdown progress.  One may have
the messages that normally go to the console, go to the terminal.  To
get this you must manually patch the kernel, except that for kernel
2.2 (or higher) it is a "make config" option.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-18.html#term_as_console">Make a Serial Terminal the Console</A>.</P>
