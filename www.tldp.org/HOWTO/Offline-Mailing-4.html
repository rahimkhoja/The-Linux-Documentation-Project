<P>Now you created the extra account, you got the mail address - and/or the DNS
entry &amp; forwarding to your account ... As well installed Procmail &amp; Fetchmail
so we can rock the place ! :) .. here we go !
<OL>
<LI>You need to create a .procmailrc file, what will contain the "delivery"
info to your users.</LI>
<LI>You need to create a "nosuchuserfile" - so the writer knows his mail isn't
delivered well.</LI>
<LI>For best work :) you could use crontab to check for mail. This is a easy
way to check your mail every XX minutes when on the internet.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Creating a .fetchmailrc file</A>
</H2>

<P>You will need to create a .fetchmailrc file, what will contain the information
(username &amp; password, as well the Mail Delivery Agent (mda) to proces the mail
to). Here is some example file ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This file will be used to fetch your mail. Please test it by using the
fetchmail program "fetchmail -vv" - and see your mail is being transferred
right ... There will be some errors - since the procmail control file hasn't
been created yet. You can wait by testing AFTER making the procmailrc file,
but - i'll warn ya - IF there is something fault :) it CAN be this file :)
It needs to be owned by the user account itself - in my case "mailservice"
and needs to be "user readable" but NOT group/world readable - since it
contains the "main password" :)). (chmod 600 .fetchmailrc will do).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Creating a .procmailrc file</A>
</H2>

<P>This control file will forward all mail to the users in it. There are 2 ways
as described before - the "to:" (header) way - and the "subject" (sloppy) way.
The file will contain the usernames to transport to. All the "#" are comments
and are absolutely not needed when not wanted - it's only so you know what i
am doing ... - you can as well best chmod it 600 - so the rest of the world
or group doesn't need those private addresses eh :) ... It needs also to be
owned by the user (like "mailservice") :)). The "nosuchuserfile" is a
"bounce" to the writer - if the user isn't found (so mail not delivered) in
the procmailrc file ... - so the writer knows the mail isn't delivered well.
<P>
<H3>For "header (to:)" transportation</H3>

<P>If you don't know how crontab works :) better read the manual :) ...
You need to create a "checkmail" file - what will see if the link is up,
as well the cronfile itself ... - i am using a ppp link :) so - this is an
example how to look when the ppp link is up - and to poll every 10 minutes
using cron. Looks sloppy - but isn't !.
<P>
<P>
<H3>checkformail</H3>

<P>the .checkformail file will be called (needs to be executable as well) - and
will look if the ppp link is up. If it is up - then it will fetch for mail.
Crontab will use this file when you are using the below cronentry ...

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 "At the admins site".</A>
</H2>

<P>Well, this should be done when using the "A method" ... at the admin's site,
so the email goes all from a complete domain, to one username. It is pretty
simple, and once you've done it - it works like hell. this is NOT neccesary
if your system administrator (the uplink) got another method, and is NOT
neccesary at YOUR side !!!!
<P>When using a newer version of sendmail, the "old sendmail" trick probably
won't work, so please refer to the "new sendmail" topics to let your
mailrouting work.
<P>
<H3>(old sendmail) add some lines to sendmail.cf</H3>

<P>add the following lines to your /etc/sendmail.cf file, so the domains file
will be read.  please be noted that the "ruleset 98" is added as underhere,
since - once you got errors :) it's a hell to find 'm out ! (and i can know
it :) DuH).

<P>If you are using another "location" for the sendmail.cw file, then please
replace the "/etc/sendmail.cw" to "/yourhomedirectory/sendmail.cw". The
pro points of putting this sendmail.cw file into your homedirectory is
that you don't need root to change the domains to receive on. tough - this
can give security risks if not used properly !
<P>This file can already exist, or needs to be created, if it already exists
be sure you don't overwrite the older data - or i need to refer you to my
fine disclaimer :)
<P>First create a /etc/sendmail.cw file, what will be used to "send" a domain
to a specific user ... here is an example ... (as you already knew, the name
"mailservice" can be anything you want - it can even be your loginname (like
mine is freaker).

cd /etc    (or /yourhomedir)
makemap btree maildomains &lt; maildomains

<P>after that, kill the sendmail daemon, and restart it. it should now WORK!
