This basically means you set up a subscription of some sort and then follow
the news as they come in. Be careful not to bite over more than you can
chew, <EM>information overload</EM> is more than a buzzword. There is also
rather more junk out there than is just annoying, it is a real problem
these days. Read critically and be prepared to unsubscribe.
<P>There are two distinct medias for getting continuous updates: news and
mailing lists, though sometimes news is gatewayed to mail and vice
versa. In general news is a larger volume, larger noise source compared to
mailing lists. Trying to follow too many newsgroups is like drinking from a
fire hose.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Usenet News</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
up-to-date!information resources!news
-->

Getting access to Usenet News is outside the scope of this HOWTO, there are
others that will help you with getting and reading News directly from a
Linux system. If you have never used News before you should be careful to
read the introductory information thoroughly. In spite of looking like an
anarchy it does have its own distinct culture, follow a newsgroup for some
time before posting yourself. Most importantly, look out for postings
called <EM>Frequently Asked Questions</EM> or <EM>FAQ</EM> as they will show you
the ropes for the group it is posted to, and most likely give you the
answer to what you are looking for. Asking an FAQ will earn you severe
negative credibility points as well as a place in many killfiles.
<P>FAQs should be posted regularly but if you cannot find it you can always
find it at the 
<A HREF="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu">main FAQ archive</A>
at MIT.
<P>These are also available as
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/">web pages</A>.
<P>
<P>Still, there is a lot of noise, spam and junk in News and this is where
killfiles come in. You will need a news reader with killfile capability and
when properly set up it will scan through a newsgroup according to a search
key of your own design and mark all flagged postings as already read so you
don't have to be bothered by the noise. This improves the signal-to-noise
ratio and lets you concentrate on the important parts. Similarly, if you
make noise in News others will killfile you so if you later were to ask for
help they will never see your post.
<P>Now to business: the following is a list of useful newsgroups:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce">announcements</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.answers">answers, HOWTOs, FAQs etc.</A></LI>

<P>Many national hierarchies also have Linux groups, such as the
<A HREF="news:no.linux">Norwegian</A> Linux groups. If you
cannot find your national or local group you might be able to use

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Mailing Lists</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
up-to-date!information resources!mailing lists

Unlike Usenet News a mailing list is centralised, someone sends a mail to
the server and the server in return mails everyone that is subscribed to
that particular list. These lists are generally low volume but also very
low noise. Any breaches of the charter will be looked harshly upon. Equally
seriously it will delay the development or the project that the list is
dedicated to. When you subscribe you will normally get an introductory mail
describing the charter, again you are strongly recommended to read this
very carefully.
<P>There are many types of mail servers that can handle a list and you will
need some information on how and where you can subscribe.
<P>One of the most common list servers is <EM>Majordomo</EM> which is what the
list server at
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">vger.rutgers.edu</A>
is running. To learn how it works you send a mail message with the word
<CODE>help</CODE> in the body. If you send it something it cannot parse you will
get this help message anyway.
If you instead mail it the word <CODE>lists</CODE> you will be returned a list of
all mailing lists it serves, and that can be a considerable number.
<P>Other mailing lists use several addresses, one where you send your requests
such as <CODE>subscribe</CODE> and <CODE>unsubscribe</CODE>, and one where you send your
contributions to the list which is usually also the address from which the
list is also redistributed to you.
Again, sending it the message <CODE>help</CODE> or something it cannot parse will
give you the help information.
An example: you send the word <CODE>subscribe</CODE> to the
address <CODE>corned-beef-requests@somelistserver.org</CODE>
and then you get mail from and contribute to the
list address  <CODE>corned-beef-list@somelistserver.org</CODE>
until you unsubscribe.
<P>A few tips before you start sending in to mailing lists:
<UL>
<LI>Do not send <CODE>subscribe</CODE> etc. to the list itself, only to the
server address, otherwise you will look silly and you will annoy
people. There can be several thousand subscribers to a list and if such errors were to
pour in the noise would be too much.</LI>
<LI>When you subscribe you will often get an introductory message
sent to you automatically. Read it carefully as this should answer
most of the initial questions.</LI>
<LI>Do not gateway mailing lists to news without asking first as this
can cause mailing loops as well as spam.</LI>

<P>There are of course a number of other lists on other server. As this
is in a constant state of flux there is little point in naming all but
the most important here. Instead you could check out a web page that

on various servers of interest to Linux users. It also offers an user friendly

Many have been disappointed at the lack of information on Linux in the
trade press. This is probably because certain commercial products would
not stand up for any comparison and the advertisers would not stand it
at all. Fortunately there is one Linux specific journal, called
the <EM>Linux Journal</EM>. More information on subscription etc. can be
found at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ssc.com">SSC</A>
home page. A table of contents is usually also available online.
<P>Another commercial paper magazine is the
<A HREF="http://www.linux-mag.com">Linux Magazine</A>
which also offers table of contents and some excerpts online.
<P>Also
<A HREF="http://www.unixreview.com">Unix Review</A>
(formerly known as Performance Computing)
gives a lot of Linux coverage.
