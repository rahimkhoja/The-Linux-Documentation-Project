where you can start looking:

</H2>

<P>No article on TrueType support under Linux would be complete without
a comment about Microsoft's free TrueType fonts.  First the legality
of using Microsoft's free core fonts:

Q. What can I do with these fonts?
   &middot; Anyone can download and install these fonts for 
     their own use.
   &middot; [Web page] designers can specify the fonts within 
     their own Web pages.

<P>Clearly, it is legal and reasonable for Linux users to download
and install these fonts, and I would like to thank Microsoft for
making them available.
<P>Since another clause restricts their redistribution "in any form 
that adds value to commercial products" I don't expect to see
these fonts packaged in <CODE>main</CODE> anytime soon.  (Could they be 
packaged in <CODE>non-free</CODE>, perhaps as an installer package...?)
<P>Now that that's out of the way, I redirect your attention to the
second statement.  Microsoft actively encourages web page developers 
to specify their fonts on web pages, and many HTML editors explicitly 
name fonts. 
<P>Many web sites, when viewed by standard Netscape/Linux, can best 
be described as... legible.  Some aren't even that.  Not coincidentally
the sites which are, um, legible are also usually the sites that
explicitly state all font information in their web pages. 
<P>After I installed these fonts I noticed that most of these problematic
sites became significantly more attractive.  Many were still highly 
Windows-centric, but at least I didn't flinch every time I loaded 
their pages.
<P>My recommendation is to install Microsoft's free TrueType fonts
for your browser.  You are not required to create web pages that
use these fonts, nor do you have to configure <CODE>ghostscript</CODE> to
use them.
