<P>Alife takes yet another approach to exploring the mysteries of
intelligence.  It has many aspects similar to EC and Connectionism, but
takes these ideas and gives them a meta-level twist. Alife emphasizes the
development of intelligence through <I>emergent</I> behavior of
<I>complex adaptive systems</I>.  Alife stresses the social or group
based aspects of intelligence. It seeks to understand life and survival. By
studying the behaviors of groups of 'beings' Alife seeks to discover the
way intelligence or higher order activity emerges from seemingly simple
individuals. Cellular Automata and Conway's Game of Life are probably the
most commonly known applications of this field. Complex Systems
(abbreviated CS) are very similar to alife in the way the are approached,
just more general in definition (ie.  alife is a type of complex system).
Usually complex system software takes the form of a simulator.</P>

<P>The Integrating Modelling Toolkit (IMT) is a generic, comprehensive,
and extensible set of abstractions allowing definition and use of
interoperable model components.  Modellers create an IMT "world" made
of IMT "agents" that will perform each a particular phase of a
modelling task.  The core set of IMT agents can describe generic,
modular, distributed model components, either native to the IMT or
integrating existing simulation toolkits, specialized for tasks that
range from simple calculation of functions in an interpreted language
to spatially explicit simulation, model optimization, GIS analysis,
visualization and advanced statistical analysis.  IMT agents are
designed to easily "glue" together in higher-level simulations
integrating different modelling paradigms and toolkits.  The IMT can be
easily extended by users and developers through a convenient plug-in

mutations. The population adapts to the combination of an intrinsic
fitness landscape (self-reproduction) and an externally imposed

<P>This is a free version of the Creatures3 ALife game. It has fewer
species and a small 'space-station' world, but can connect to other
worlds over the internet and (if you have the windows version of the
game) can connect to your C3 world. The game itself revolves around
breeding and training the alife creatures, 'Norns'. Its strikes a
pretty nice balance between fun and science, or so I'm told.</P>
<P>(summary written by Steve Grand included below)</P>
<P>The eponymous creatures in this computer game are called Norns, and the
world's population of them at one stage hovered around the five million
mark, making them more common than many familiar natural species. Each
norn is composed of thousands of tiny simulated biological components,
such as neurons, biochemicals, chemoreceptors, chemoemitters and genes.
The norns' genes dictate how these components are assembled to make
complete organisms, and the creatures' behaviour then emerges from the
interactions of those parts, rather than being explicitly 'programmed
in'.</P>
<P>The norns are capable of learning about their environment, either by
being shown things by their owners or through learning by their own
mistakes. They must learn for themselves how to find food and how to
interact with the many objects in their environment. They can interact
with their owners, using simple language, and also with each other.
They can form relationships and produce offspring, which inherit their
neural and biochemical structure from their parents and are capable of
open-ended evolution over time. They can fall prey to a variety of
diseases (as well as genetic defects) and can be treated with
appropriate medicines.</P>

<P>Langton's Ant is an example of a finite-state cellular automata. The
ant (or ants) start out on a grid. Each cell is either black or white.
If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 and moves forward
one unit. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 and moves
forward one unit.  And when the ant leaves a square, it inverts the
color. The neat thing about Langton's Ant is that no matter what
pattern field you start it out on, it eventually builds a "road," which
is a series of 117 steps that repeat indefinitely, each time leaving
the ant displaced one pixel vertically and horizontally.</P>

<P>PolyWorld is a computational ecology that I developed to explore issues
in Artificial Life. Simulated organisms reproduce sexually, fight and
kill and eat each other, eat the food that grows throughout the world,
and either develop successful strategies for survival or die. An
organism's entire behavioral suite (move, turn, attack, eat, mate,
light) is controlled by its neural network "brain". Each brain's
architecture--it's neural wiring diagram--is determined from its
genetic code, in terms of number, size, and composition of neural
clusters (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and the types of
connections between those clusters (connection density and topological
mapping). Synaptic efficacy is modulated via Hebbian learning, so, in
principle, the organisms have the ability to learn during the course of
their lifetimes. The organisms perceive their world through a sense of
vision, provided by a computer graphic rendering of the world from each
organism's point of view. The organisms' physiologies are also encoded
genetically, so both brain and body, and thus all components of
behavior, evolve over multiple generations. A variety of "species",
with varying individual and group survival strategies have emerged in
various simulations, displaying such complex ethological behaviors as
swarming/flocking, foraging, and attack avoidance.</P>

creates a virtual computer and its operating system, whose
architecture has been designed in such a way that the executable
machine codes are evolve-able. This means that the machine code can be
mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined (by swapping
segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting code remains
functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably artificial)
selection to be able to improve the code over time.</P>

<P>Trend is a general purpose cellular automata simulation environment
with an integrated high level language compiler, a beautiful graphical
user interface, and a fast, three stage cached simulation engine. This
is the simulation system that was used to discover the first emergent
self-replicating cellular automata rule set, and the first problem
solving self-replication loop.</P>
<P>Since its simulator is very flexible with regard to cellular space
sizes, cell structures, neighborhood structures and cellular automata
rules, Trend can simulate almost all one or two-dimensional cellular
automata models. It also has a smart backtracking feature which
simplifies rule set development a lot by allowing users to go back to a
previous stage of simulation! With other advanced features, Trend is
probably the most easy to use 2-dimensional cellular automata
simulator.</P>
<P>Also available is jTrend. A Java version of Trend.</P>

<P>This program will evolve patterns for John Horton Conway's game
of Life.  It will also handle general cellular automata with the
orthogonal neighborhood and up to 8 states (it's possible to recompile
for more states, but very expensive in memory).  Transition rules and
sample patterns are provided for the 8-state automaton of E. F. Codd,
the Wireworld automaton, and a whole class of `Prisoner's Dilemma'
games.</P>
