>5.2. Use a license conformant to the Open Source Definition</H2
><P
>The Open Source Definition is the community gold standard for
licenses.  The OSD is not a license itself; rather, it defines a
minimum set of rights that a license must guarantee in order to be
considered an open-source license.  The OSD, and supporting materials,
may be found at the web site of the <A
HREF="http://www.opensource.org"

>Open Source Initiative</A
>.</P

>5.3. Don't write your own license if you can possibly avoid it.</H2
><P
>The widely-known OSD-conformant licenses have well-established
interpretive traditions.  Developers (and, to the extent they care, users)
know what they imply, and have a reasonable take on the risks and tradeoffs
they involve.  Therefore, use one of the standard licenses carried on the
OSI site if at all possible.</P
><P
>If you must write your own license, be sure to have it certified
by OSI.  This will avoid a lot of argument and overhead.  Unless
you've been through it, you have no idea how nasty a licensing
flamewar can get; people become passionate because the licenses are
regarded as almost-sacred covenants touching the core values of the
open-source community.</P
><P
>Furthermore, the presence of an established interpretive tradition may
prove important if your license is ever tested in court.  At time of 
writing (early 2002) there is no case law either supporting or invalidating
any open-source license.  However, it is a legal doctrine (at least in
the U.S., and probably in other common-law countries such as England
and the rest of the British Commonwealth) that courts are supposed to 
interpret licenses and contracts according to the expectations and
practices of the community in which they originated.</P

>5.4. Make your license visible in a standard place.</H2
><P
>As larger and larger volumes of open-source software are deployed,
the problem of auditing these volumes for which licenses cover them become
nontrivial &#8212; in fact, it becomes larger than an unaided human being
can perform. Therefore, it is valuable to have conventions that support
mechanized querying of the licensing information. Fortunately, existing
community practise already tends in this direction.</P
><P
>As a beginning, the license information for your software should
live in a file named either COPYING or LICENSE in the top-level directory
of your source distribution.  If a single license applies to the entire
distribution, that file should include a copy of the license.  If multiple
licenses apply, that file should list the applicable licenses and
indicate to which files and subdirectories they apply.</P
