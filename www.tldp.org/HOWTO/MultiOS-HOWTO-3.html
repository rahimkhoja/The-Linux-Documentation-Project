<P>Even though Linux is becoming much more user
friendly and widely accepted, most of us still need access to other
operating systems.  I use Linux about 75% of the time but I still
need access to Win 9x for those few applications that I haven't found
acceptable alternatives for in Linux.  My wife uses MS Office at work and
wants to have access to it at home. Other people want to have access to
alternative O/S just for fun, training, or to keep current in their job.
<P>
<P>I tend to treat new O/S's as you would a game; I actually don't do
anything productive with them but installing and learning how to control
them is just as challenging and interesting to me as Quake or SimCity.
Further, being a Computer Scientist, it keeps me current on evolving
technology and has helped me solve a multitude of problems at work.
At any rate, for new Linux users, computer professionals, and those just
trying to migrate from one operating system to another, I believe using
multiple operating systems is the norm rather than the exception.
<P>
