><P
>The script is presented here to show the commands in a formal way and to propose a way to reduce the possibility of damages resulting from mistyping. You have to change the variables <TT

CLASS="VARNAME"

>Please note that the arrays <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>major_a</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>family_a</TT
> are corresponding. Wrong major number for a given family name will mislead the user. You can locate the major and minor numbers of the devices of interest (whole disks and partitions) by listing the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> directory. The major and minor number are where the size of a regular file is, in the output of the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls -l</B
