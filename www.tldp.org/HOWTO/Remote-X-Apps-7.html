<H2><A NAME="s7">7. X Applications from Another User-id</A></H2>

<P>Suppose you want to run a graphical configuration tool that requires
root privileges.  However, your X session is running under your usual
account.  It may seem strange at first, but the X server will <EM>not</EM>
allow the tool to access your display.  How is this possible when root
can normally do anything?  And how do you work around this problem?
<P>
<P>Let's generalise to the situation where you want to an X appliation
under a user-id <CODE>clientuser</CODE>, but the X session was started
by <CODE>serveruser</CODE>.  If you have read the section on cookies,
it is clear why <CODE>clientuser</CODE> cannot access your display:
<CODE>~clientuser/.Xauthority</CODE> does not contain the right magic
cookie for accessing the display.  The right cookie is found in
<CODE>~serveruser/.Xauthority</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Different Users on the Same Host</A>
</H2>

<P>Of course, anything that works for remote X also works for X from
a different user-id as well (particularly <CODE>slogin localhost -l
clientuser</CODE>).  It's just that the client host and the server host happen
to be the same.  However, when both hosts are the same, there are some
shortcuts for transferring the magic cookie.
<P>
<P>We'll assume that you use <CODE>su</CODE> to switch user-ids.  Basically, what
you have to do is write a script that will call <CODE>su</CODE>, but wraps the
command that <CODE>su</CODE> executes with some code that does the necessary
things for remote X.  These necessary things are setting the <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE>
variable and transferring the magic cookie.
<P>
<P>Setting <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> is relatively easy; it just means defining
<CODE>DISPLAY="$DISPLAY"</CODE> before running the su command argument.  So you
could just do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
su - clientuser -c "env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY clientprogram &amp;"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This doesn't work yet, because we still have to transfer the cookie.
We can retrieve the cookie using <CODE>xauth list "$DISPLAY"</CODE>.  This command
happens to list the cookie in a format that's suitable for feeding back
to the <CODE>xauth add</CODE> command; just what we need!
<P>We shall want to pass the cookie through a pipe.  Unfortunately, it
isn't easy to pass something through a pipe to the <CODE>su</CODE> command,
because <CODE>su</CODE> wants to read the password from its standard input.
Fortunately again, in a shell script we can joggle some file descriptors
around, and get it done.
<P>So we write a script around this, parameterizing by <CODE>clientuser</CODE>
and <CODE>clientprogram</CODE>.  Let's improve the script a little while we're
at it, making it less readable but more robust.  It looks like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -lt 2 ]
then echo "usage: `basename $0` clientuser command" >&amp;2
     exit 2
fi

CLIENTUSER="$1"
shift

# FD 4 becomes stdin too
exec 4>&amp;0

xauth list "$DISPLAY" | sed -e 's/^/add /' | {

    # FD 3 becomes xauth output
    # FD 0 becomes stdin again
    # FD 4 is closed
    exec 3>&amp;0 0>&amp;4 4>&amp;-

    exec su - "$CLIENTUSER" -c \
         "xauth -q &lt;&amp;3
          exec env DISPLAY='$DISPLAY' "'"$SHELL"'" -c '$*' 3>&amp;-"

}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I think this is portable and works well enough in most circumstances.
The only shortcoming I can think of right now is that, due to using
<CODE>'$*'</CODE>, single quotes in <CODE>command</CODE> will mess up quoting in the
<CODE>su</CODE> command argument (<CODE>'$*'</CODE>).  If there's anything else seriously
wrong with it, please drop me an email.
<P>
<P>Call the script <CODE>/usr/local/bin/xsu</CODE>, and you can do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xsu clientuser 'command &amp;'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Can't be much easier, unless you get rid of the password.  Yes, there
are ways for that too (<CODE>sudo</CODE>), but this is not the place for that.
<P>
<P>The tiny <CODE>xsu</CODE> script just mentioned has served as the basis for a
more extended script called <CODE>sux</CODE> which apparently has found its way
as a package into the 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>
distribution.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Client User Is Root</A>
</H2>

<P>Obviously, anything that works for non-root client users is going to
work for root as well.  However, with root you can make it even easier,
because root can read anyone's <CODE>~/.Xauthority</CODE> file.  There's no
need to transfer the cookie.  All you have to do is set <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE>, and
point <CODE>XAUTHORITY</CODE> to <CODE>~serveruser/.Xauthority</CODE>.  So you can do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
su - -c "exec env DISPLAY='$DISPLAY' \
                  XAUTHORITY='${XAUTHORITY-$HOME/.Xauthority}' \
                  command"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Putting it into a script would give something like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -lt 1 ]
then echo "usage: `basename $0` command" >&amp;2
     exit 2
fi
su - -c "exec env DISPLAY='$DISPLAY' \
                  XAUTHORITY='${XAUTHORITY-$HOME/.Xauthority}' \
                  "'"$SHELL"'" -c '$*'"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Call the script <CODE>/usr/local/bin/xroot</CODE>, and you can do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xroot 'control-panel &amp;'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Although, if you've set up <CODE>xsu</CODE> already, there's no real reason to
do this.
