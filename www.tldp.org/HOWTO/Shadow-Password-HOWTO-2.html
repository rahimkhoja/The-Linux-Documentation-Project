<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Why shadow your passwd file?</A></H2>

<P>By default, most current Linux distributions do not contain the
<EM>Shadow Suite</EM> installed.  This includes Slackware 2.3, Slackware 3.0,
and other popular distributions.  One of the reasons for this is that
the copyright notices in the original <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> were not clear
on redistribution if a fee was charged.  Linux uses a GNU Copyright
(sometimes refereed to as a Copyleft) that allows people to package it into a
convenient package (like a CD-ROM distribution) and charge a fee for it. 
<P>The current maintainer of the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM>, 
<A HREF="mailto:marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl">Marek Michalkiewicz &lt;marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl></A> 
received the source code from the original author under a BSD style
copyright that allowed redistribution.   Now that the copyright issues 
are resolved, it is expected that future distributions will contain 
password shadowing by default.  Until then, you will need to install it
yourself.
<P>If you installed your distribution from a CD-ROM, you may find that, even 
though the distribution did not have the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> installed, 
some of the files you need to install the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> may be on 
the CD-ROM.  
<P><EM>However, Shadow Suite versions 3.3.1, 3.3.1-2, and shadow-mk all have
security problems with their login program and several other <EM>suid
root</EM> programs that came with them, and should no longer be used.</EM>
<P>All of the necessary files may be obtained via anonymous FTP or through the 
World Wide Web.
<P>On a Linux system without the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> installed, user
information including passwords is stored in the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file.
The password is stored in an <EM>encrypted</EM> format.  If you ask a
cryptography expert, however, he or she will tell you that the password
is actually in an <EM>encoded</EM> rather than <EM>encrypted</EM> format 
because when using crypt(3), the text is set to null and the password is the
key.  Therefore, from here on, I will use the term <EM>encoded</EM> in this
document.
<P>The algorithm used to encode the password field is technically
referred to as a <EM>one way hash function</EM>.  This is an algorithm that
is easy to compute in one direction, but very difficult to calculate in the
reverse direction.  More about the actual algorithm used can be found
in section 2.4 or your crypt(3) manual page.
<P>When a user picks or is assigned a password, it is encoded with a randomly 
generated value called the <EM>salt</EM>.  This means that any particular 
password could be stored in 4096 different ways.  The <EM>salt</EM> value 
is then stored with the encoded password.
<P>When a user logs in and supplies a password, the <EM>salt</EM> is first
retrieved from the stored encoded password.  Then the supplied password is
<EM>encoded</EM> with the <EM>salt</EM> value, and then compared with the
<EM>encoded</EM> password.  If there is a match, then the user is
authenticated.
<P>It is computationally difficult (but not impossible) to take a randomly
<EM>encoded</EM> password and recover the original password.  However, on
any system with more than just a few users, at least some of the passwords
will be common words (or simple variations of common words).
<P>System crackers know all this, and will simply encrypt a dictionary of
words and common passwords using all possible 4096 <EM>salt</EM> values.  
Then they will compare the encoded passwords in your <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>
file with their database.  Once they have found a match, they have the
password for another account.  This is referred to as a <EM>dictionary 
attack</EM>, and is one of the most common methods for gaining or expanding
unauthorized access to a system.
<P>If you think about it, an 8 character password encodes to 4096 * 13 character
strings.  So a dictionary of say 400,000 common words, names, passwords, and
simple variations would easily fit on a 4GB hard drive.  The attacker need
only sort them, and then check for matches.  Since a 4GB hard drive can be
had for under $1000.00, this is well within the means of most system
crackers.
<P>Also, if a cracker obtains your <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file first, they only 
need to encode the dictionary with the <CODE>salt</CODE> values actually 
contained in your <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file.  This method is usable by your 
average teenager with a couple of hundred spare Megabytes and a 486 class 
computer.
<P>Even without lots of drive space, utilities like crack(1) can usually break
at least a couple of passwords on a system with enough users (assuming the
users of the system are allowed to pick their own passwords).
<P>The <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file also contains information like user ID's and
group ID's that are used by many system programs.  Therefore, the 
<CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file <EM>must</EM> remain world readable.  If you were 
to change the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file so that nobody can read it, the 
first thing that you would notice is that the <CODE>ls -l</CODE> command now 
displays user ID's instead of names!
<P>The <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> solves the problem by relocating the passwords to 
another file (usually <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE>).  The <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file is set so
that it cannot be read by just anyone.  Only <EM>root</EM> will be able to
read and write to the <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file.  Some programs (like xlock)
don't need to be able to change passwords, they only need to be able to
verify them.  These programs can either be run <EM>suid root</EM> or you can
set up a group <EM>shadow</EM> that is allowed read only access to the 
<CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file.  Then the program can be run <EM>sgid
shadow</EM>.
<P>By moving the passwords to the <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file, we are effectively
keeping the attacker from having access to the encoded passwords with which
to perform a <EM>dictionary attack</EM>.
<P>Additionally, the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> adds lots of other nice features:
<UL>
<LI>A configuration file to set login defaults (<CODE>/etc/login.defs</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>Utilities for adding, modifying, and deleting user accounts and groups</LI>
<LI>Password aging and expiration</LI>
<LI>Account expiration and locking</LI>
<LI>Shadowed group passwords (optional)</LI>
<LI>Double length passwords (16 character passwords) NOT RECOMMENDED]
<LI>Better control over user's password selection
<LI>Dial-up passwords
<LI>Secondary authentication programs [NOT RECOMMENDED]</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Installing the <EM>Shadow Suite</EM> contributes toward a more 
secure system, but there are many other things that can also be done to 
improve the security of a Linux system, and there will eventually be a 
series of Linux Security HOWTO's that will discuss other security measures 
and related issues.

known vulnerabilities see the

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Why you might NOT want to shadow your passwd file.</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a few circumstances and configurations in which installing the
<EM>Shadow Suite</EM> would <EM>NOT</EM> be a good idea:
<UL>
<LI>The machine does not contain user accounts.</LI>
<LI>Your machine is running on a LAN and is using NIS (Network Information
Services) to get or supply user names and passwords to other machines on
the network.  (This can actually be done, but is beyond the scope of this
document, and really won't increase security much anyway)</LI>
<LI>Your machine is being used by terminal servers to verify users via NFS
(Network File System), NIS, or some other method.</LI>
<LI>Your machine runs other software that validates users, and there is no
shadow version available, and you don't have the source code.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Format of the /etc/passwd file</A>
</H2>

<P>A non-shadowed <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file has the following format:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
username:passwd:UID:GID:full_name:directory:shell
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where:
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>username</CODE></B><DD><P>The user (login) name
<DT><B><CODE>passwd</CODE></B><DD><P>The encoded password
<DT><B><CODE>UID</CODE></B><DD><P>Numerical user ID
<DT><B><CODE>GID</CODE></B><DD><P>Numerical default group ID
<DT><B><CODE>full_name</CODE></B><DD><P>The user's full name - Actually this field is
called the GECOS (General Electric Comprehensive Operating System) field
and can store information other than just the full name.  The Shadow
commands and manual pages refer to this field as the comment field.
<DT><B><CODE>directory</CODE></B><DD><P>User's home directory (Full pathname)
<DT><B><CODE>shell</CODE></B><DD><P>User's login shell (Full Pathname)
</DL>

For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
username:Npge08pfz4wuk:503:100:Full Name:/home/username:/bin/sh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where <CODE>Np</CODE> is the salt and <CODE>ge08pfz4wuk</CODE> is the <EM>encoded</EM>
password.  The encoded salt/password could just as easily have been
<CODE>kbeMVnZM0oL7I</CODE> and the two are exactly the same password.  There are
4096 possible encodings for the same password.  (The example password in 
this case is 'password', a really <EM>bad</EM> password).
<P>Once the shadow suite is installed, the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file would 
instead contain:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
username:x:503:100:Full Name:/home/username:/bin/sh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>x</CODE> in the second field in this case is now just a place holder.
The format of the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file really didn't change, it just no 
longer contains the <EM>encoded</EM> password.  This means that any program 
that reads the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> file but does not actually need to verify
passwords will still operate correctly.
<P>The passwords are now relocated to the shadow file (usually 
<CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Format of the shadow file</A>
</H2>

<P>The <CODE>/etc/shadow</CODE> file contains the following information:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
username:passwd:last:may:must:warn:expire:disable:reserved
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where:
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>username</CODE></B><DD><P>The User Name
<DT><B><CODE>passwd</CODE></B><DD><P>The Encoded password
<DT><B><CODE>last</CODE></B><DD><P>Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed
<DT><B><CODE>may</CODE></B><DD><P>Days before password may be changed
<DT><B><CODE>must</CODE></B><DD><P>Days after which password must be changed
<DT><B><CODE>warn</CODE></B><DD><P>Days before password is to expire that user is warned
<DT><B><CODE>expire</CODE></B><DD><P>Days after password expires that account is disabled
<DT><B><CODE>disable</CODE></B><DD><P>Days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is disabled
<DT><B><CODE>reserved</CODE></B><DD><P>A reserved field
</DL>

The previous example might then be:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
username:Npge08pfz4wuk:9479:0:10000::::
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Review of crypt(3).</A>
</H2>

<P>From the crypt(3) manual page:
<P>&quot;<EM>crypt</EM> is the password encryption function.  It is based on
the <EM>Data Encryption Standard</EM> algorithm with variations intended (among 
other things) to discourage use of hardware implementations of a key search.
<P>[The] key is a user's typed password.  [The encoded string is all NULLs]
<P>[The] <EM>salt</EM> is a two-character string chosen from the set
[a-zA-Z0-9./].  This string is used to perturb the algorithm in one of 4096
different ways.
<P>By taking the lowest 7 bit[s] of each character of the key, a 56-bit key is 
obtained.  This 56-bit key is used to encrypt repeatedly a constant string
(usually a string consisting of all zeros).  The returned value points to
the encrypted password, a series of 13 printable ASCII characters (the first
two characters represent the salt itself).  The return value points to static
data whose content is overwritten by each call.
<P> 
<B>Warning:</B> The key space consists of 2**56 equal 7.2e16 possible values.
Exhaustive searches of this key space <B>are possible</B> using massively
parallel computers.  Software, such as <CODE>crack(1)</CODE>, is available which
will search the portion of this key space that is generally used by humans 
for passwords.  Hence, password selection should, at minimum, avoid common
words and names.  The use of a <CODE>passwd(1)</CODE> program that checks for
crackable passwords during the selection process is recommended.
<P>The DES algorithm itself has a few quirks which make the use of the
<CODE>crypt(3)</CODE> interface a very poor choice for anything other than 
password authentication.  If you are planning on using the <CODE>crypt(3)</CODE> 
interface for a cryptography project, don't do it: get a good book on 
encryption and one of the widely available DES libraries.&quot;
<P>Most <EM>Shadow Suites</EM> contain code for doubling the length of the
password to 16 characters.  Experts in <CODE>des</CODE> recommend against this, 
as the encoding is simply applied first to the left half and then to the 
right half of the longer password.  Because of the way <CODE>crypt</CODE> works, 
this may make for a <EM>less</EM> secure encoded password then if double 
length passwords were not used in the first place.  Additionally, it is less 
likely that a user will be able to remember a 16 character password.
<P>There is development work under way that would allow the authentication 
algorithm to be replaced with something more secure and with support for 
longer passwords (specifically the MD5 algorithm) and retain compatibility
with the <CODE>crypt</CODE> method.
<P>If you are looking for a good book on encryption, I recommend:
