<H2><A NAME="s3">3. The install:</A></H2>

<P>After connecting everything up to the target machine and putting the 
zip disk in place I boot the machine with the appropriate boot disk.
Before logging in it is a good idea to use the scroll back feature 
built into Linux and check to see all your hardware was detected 
properly. To do this hold the shift key and use the page up and page 
down keys as appropriate. Getting a login prompt at all usually means 
the boot time errors were not too bad.

</H2>

<P>Slackware will present some instructions. Please read them Carefully. 
Login as root and fdisk root and swap partitions on the target drive 
if needed. Reboot the machine if you ran fdisk and <B>Carefully</B> 
reread the instructions on the screen if there are any, then login as 
root.
<P>Even on machines with only 4 megs. of ram you will not need to create 
a swap partition until prompted to do so in the setup program. We 
already have swap running on the zip disk. Run the Slackware setup 
program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

CAREFULLY read and follow the instructions the menus provide.
The first thing setup will want to do is create and initialize 
your swap partition on your hard drive this is ok despite the
dire warnings and will not affect the swap file on the zip drive.
<P>You do not want to allow /dev/sda4 to be automatically mounted
and when questions come up about this in the menus. Do not
add it unless this zip drive is dedicated to the target machine
full time.
<P>When you get the menu that asks where the source of the installation
media is select item number 4. "Install from a premounted directory".
The next screen will ask for its name, it is /slakware.
<P>I recommend installing only the "a" disk set at this time. It
will crash the install if the person selecting packages gets
greedy and fills the disk before lilo is written and the kernel
is installed. During basic install I install the kernel from the 
boot disk only. There are relatively few choices to be made from here
and the Slackware documentation from the cdrom or your ftp site
will do you much better than I can from here.
<P>Leave the zip drive and disk in place after the initial install
is complete.  Remove the floppy when prompted to do so and reboot.
If all is right in the world Bill, er, your friend/customer will 
have a working Linux system come up.

<P>After rebooting the system login as root and mount the zip disk again:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          mount /dev/sda4 /mnt
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Check available drive space:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          df
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Run setup again from your new system:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          setup
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Choose "s" SOURCE from the menu and press the enter key.
Select item number 4. "Install from a premounted directory" and press 
the enter key again.
<P>Enter the directory name. This time use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          /mnt/slakware
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Choose the packages you want or need. All are available except those 
which start with "x". When you're finished installing packages from 
this disk exit setup and run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          umount /dev/sda4
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You may now remove the disk and if X will be installed insert the 2nd 
zip disk and work through setup again this time only packages beginning
with X will be available. If you will be installing a custom kernel 
from the prebuilt kernels you may also do this while the 2nd. zip disk 
is installed.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Library Trouble</A>
</H2>

<P>Some times I have trouble with the links for the libraries either on 
the root zip disk or on the final destination machine. There are two 
possible fixes for this.
<P>Fix 1) If the system boots to a command prompt and you can login as 
root in single user mode try the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ldconfig
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If things are not broken so badly that this command will not run then 
reboot and watch for library related errors. If there are none your 
in business.
<P>Fix 2) If <B>ldconfig</B> can not repair things you will need to 
re master the root floppy disk and recopy the files from it as in 
instruction 
<A HREF="Install-From-ZIP-2.html#In-8">8)</A> through 12) or reinstall Linux 
to the destination system as appropriate.
