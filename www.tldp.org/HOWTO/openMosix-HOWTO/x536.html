and enter the new directory "plumpos-6.9-rc1/". Now you have several
options as to how you go about setting up PlumpOS.</P
><P
>First let's familiarize with the directory structure here. There
should be 3 directories: 

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>rootdisk, which contains the layout of the iso to be created;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>scripts, which contains small programs used to help in the creation of
the iso;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>final, which will contain the ISO generated by the whole process.</P
></LI
></UL
>

There should also be a file called install which you will run when you
are done configuring your system.</P
><P
>If you intend on using your own kernel with PlumpOS, there are several
steps you must follow in order for it to boot properly. First you must
make a new directory in the rootdisk/kernels/ directory that will be
in the old and often blamed DoS 8.3 character format and only contain
letters and numbers (and a single '.').  In that directory you should
put a file named bzImage which is your kernel and a file named
modules.tgz which is a gzipped tarball of your kernel's modules (with
the relative path of lib/modules/ so it can be extracted from the root
dir). Optionally you can also provide the System.map and config file
for your kernel. When this is done you may simply run the install
program and it will detect and install your kernel(s) for use with the
generated ISO.</P
><P
>Now, say you want to include a 3rd party add-on package. This is done
very simply: create a gzipped tarball containing all the files you
want to include in your package (relative to "/") and put these
packages into the rootdisk/packages/ directory. Then edit the file
rootdisk/packages/list and add the path relative to / on the ramdisk
where the package can be located (in other words for a package named
"openssl.tar.gz", add the line "/cdrom/packages/openssl.tar.gz" to the
file rootdisk/packages/list). Optionally you can use a line such as
"cdrom:openssl.tar.gz" which will automatically search the cdrom's
packages directory for the package "openssl.tar.gz". In future
releases this will be useful for things like nfs and boot floppies, so
for now don't worry about it ;)</P
