When you run 'mosmon', press 't' to see the total number of machines running. Does it warn you that openMosix is not 
running?</P
><P
>&#13;If it does, then make sure your machine's IP address is included in /etc/openmosix.map. Don't use 
127.0.0.1. If you do, you will 
probably have problems with your DHCP server or your DNS nameserver.</P
><P
>&#13;If it does not, then see what machines show up. Do you see only your machine?</P
><P
>&#13;If yes, then your machine is most likely running a firewall and is not letting openMosix through.</P
><P
>&#13;If not, then the problem is most likely with the machine that doesn't show up.</P
><P
>&#13;Also: Do you have two NIC cards on a node? If so, you have to edit /etc/hosts to have a line that has the following format

You might also need to set up a routing table, which is an entirely different subject. </P

>&#13;Maybe you used different kernel-parameters on each machine? Especially if you use the 'Support clusters with a complex 
network topology' option you should take care that you use the same value for the also appearing option 'Maximum 
network-topology complexity support' on each machine.</P

Whats the difference between /etc/mosix.map , /etc/hpc.map , /etc/openmosix.map:</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>
They represent three stages of Mosix/openmosix growth. The file /etc/mosix.map is the orginal Mosix map name, The file 
/etc/hpc.map was an early openMosix map name (and 'hpc' is still used for the /proc files in openMosix). The current map 
name is /etc/openmosix.map.</P

You'll need to modify your /etc/hosts file. On Red Hat machines mostly the /etc/hosts file includes a line like

as an answer.</P

I want to install openMosix but I am afraid my machines are too weak for this:</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>A machine is never too weak: I have three P200s (64MB each) and two P166s (one with 48MB and one with 192MB). 
Two of them 
are on 10Base-T and the other three on 100Base-T. Even with these antiquated machines and "heterogenous" network, I get 
perfect load balancing to run simulation programs that I write in Perl. (Look at our 
ProgramToTestACluster"). Don't be held back 
by the fact your machines are old. To us this is a nice feature of openMosix: you can add newer machines 
to an existing 
cluster as they become available. And you do not need to have all identical machines. That's fantastic!</P
><P
>&#13;However, a 100Base-T network is recommended!

Under what conditions does VMWare work with openMosix:</P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>
If you intend to run VMWare under openMosix so that openMosix would load-balance several instances of that (yes, that 
works). But, if you want to run openMosix in several VMWare instances and let these instances load balance (that fails).</P
><P
>&#13;The first case works. The latter case does not work because VMware has a bug in its Pentium emulation that makes VMware 
crash (not openMosix, but the VMware binary) on the first migration.</P

Only IA-32 is currently supported. The port of openMosix to the Intel(r) Itanium(tm) IA-64 Processor Family is complete. 
Project plans for openMosix' second year include porting to the 64-bit AMD Opteron(tm) processor.</P
