<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is a Linmodem?</A>
</H2>

<P>A Linmodem is the Linux implementation of a "winmodem" (see disclaimer).
These devices are 'less than' a modem in the sense that they depend
on software to perform, to a greater or lesser extent, the functions traditionally
handled by modem hardware.  The rationale for this is, of course,
that software is cheaper than hardware, and can be
upgraded/expanded/improved without
the use of screwdrivers (usually); however, for the modem to
function at all, one requires software that can
run on one's preferred operating system.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Which Linmodem hardware is supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>An ever-growing number of winmodems will work under
Linux.  Each chipset for which a driver is known to exist has a
section in this document, below, describing its installation.  
Any other chipset has <EM>no known support</EM> under Linux
(at least, not known to us).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 How can I find out if my GeeWhiz 9.8.7 Modem / Laptop has one of these chipsets?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Information from the system</H3>

<P>
<P>The information about installed hardware using commands such as:
<UL>
<LI> PCI: <CODE> cat /proc/pci </CODE> and <CODE> lspci </CODE></LI>
<LI> ISA: <CODE> pnpdump </CODE> and <CODE> isapnp </CODE></LI>
<LI> Internal PCMCIA: <CODE> cardctl ident </CODE></LI>
<LI> General: <CODE> dmesg | more </CODE> and <CODE> cat /proc/interrupts </CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>MarvS notes that the Device Manager under Windows can provide similar information, 
but it should be
noted that a manufacturer will often simply put its brand name on a built-in modem, so
this information may not be as useful as you might hope (e.g., what chipset does
a "Compaq Internal 56k" modem have?).  Additional information may sometimes be
obtained by making a modem log, implemented under MS Windows as a check box
option within the Dial Up Networking menus.  The file produced is 
<CODE>C:\WINDOWS\MODEM.LOG</CODE>.  It will contain the modem initialization strings, 
and perhaps also the name of the modem configuration file, which may also contain 
other useful information.
<P>
<H3>Modem names and identification numbers</H3>

<P>If you know the precise name of your modem, you can try searching
the large Linux Modem Compatibility
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html#Database">Database</A>
at
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">Rob Clark's site</A>.
The color/letter code on the left side of the table will indicate if
your modem is known to function or not under Linux.  The code "LM" indicates
a Linmodem, and the modem notes should indicate which driver you need.
A "WM" means it's a winmodem, but no Linux support is known to exist.
Be careful not to assume that modems with similar names will contain
the same chipsets, or will necessarily behave similarly whatsoever!  
Your WhizBang LX56
and your friend's WhizBang GT56 could have entirely different innards. 
<P>If you do not know the precise name of your modem, you can search based
on the identification number of the modem (
on every modem there must be printed a registration number,
which may either be the board producer's designation, or,
alternatively, an FCC registration number.
An example photo of such an ID number on a modem board can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/fcc1.jpg">http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/fcc1.jpg</A> on 
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">Rob Clark's site</A>.)
Use your web browser's "Find in Page" to search his
<A HREF="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html#Database">table</A>
of modems and FCC ID's 
to obtain chipset/driver information.  Alternatively, you can directly
search the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) database at
<A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid/">http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid/</A>.
Read the directions carefully, and be careful not to confuse O (the letter)
with 0 (the number), and other possible mixups.
<P>
<H3>Laptops with internal modems</H3>

<P>You may not be able to obtain the FCC ID number if you have a laptop
which you prefer not to open up, or are looking to buy a particular
machine and the vendor has not been polite enough to provide you
with the information nor a sample box for you to take apart and play with.  In these
cases, you might try:
