<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Preparing the Jail</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Creating a User</A>
</H2>

<P>As mentioned in the introduction, it's not a good idea to run BIND as root.  So,
before we begin, let's create a separate user for BIND.  Note that you should
never use an existing generic user like <CODE>nobody</CODE> for this purpose.
However, some distributions, such as SuSE and Linux Mandrake have started
providing a specific user (generally called <CODE>named</CODE>); you can simply adapt
this user for our purposes, if you like.
<P>This requires adding a line something like the following to <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
named:x:200:200:Nameserver:/chroot/named:/bin/false
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

And one like this to <CODE>/etc/group</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
named:x:200:
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This creates a user and group called <CODE>named</CODE> for BIND.  Make sure that the
UID and GID (both 200 in this example) are unique on your system.  The shell is
set to <CODE>/bin/false</CODE> because this user will never need to log in.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Directory Structure</A>
</H2>

<P>Now, we must set up the directory structure that we will use for the chroot jail
in which BIND will live.  This can be anywhere on your filesystem; the truly
paranoid may even want to put it on a separate volume.  I shall assume that you
will use <CODE>/chroot/named</CODE>.  Let's start by creating the following directory
structure:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/chroot
  +-- named
       +-- dev
       +-- etc
       |    +-- namedb
       |         +-- slave
       +-- var
            +-- run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you use GNU <CODE>mkdir</CODE> (such as on a Linux system), you can create this
directory structure like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkdir -p /chroot/named
# cd /chroot/named
# mkdir -p dev etc/namedb/slave var/run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Placing the BIND Data</A>
</H2>

<P>Assuming that you have already done a conventional installation of BIND and are
using it, you will already have an existing <CODE>named.conf</CODE> and zone files.
These files must now be moved (or copied, to be safe) into the chroot jail, so
that BIND can get at them.  <CODE>named.conf</CODE> goes in <CODE>/chroot/named/etc</CODE>,
and the zone files can go in <CODE>/chroot/named/etc/namedb</CODE>.  For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp -p /etc/named.conf /chroot/named/etc/

# cp -a /var/named/* /chroot/named/etc/namedb/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>BIND would normally need to write to the <CODE>namedb</CODE> directory, but in the
interests of tightening security, we will not allow it to do this.  If your
nameserver serves as a slave for any zones, it will need to update these zone
files, which means we'll have to store them in a separate directory, to which
BIND does have write access.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chown -R named:named /chroot/named/etc/namedb/slave
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Keep in mind that'll you have to move any slave zones you have into this
directory, and update your <CODE>named.conf</CODE> accordingly.
<P>BIND will also need to write to the <CODE>/var/run</CODE> directory, to put its
pidfile and statistical information there, so let's allow it to do so:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chown named:named /chroot/named/var/run
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 System Support Files</A>
</H2>

<P>Once BIND is running in the chroot jail, it will not be able to access files
outside the jail <B>at all</B>.  However, it needs to access a few key files,
although not nearly as many as BIND 8 did.
<P>One file that BIND will need inside its jail is good ol' <CODE>/dev/null</CODE>.
Note that the exact command necessary to create this device node may vary from
system to system; check your <CODE>/dev/MAKEDEV</CODE> script to be sure.  Some
systems may also require <CODE>/dev/zero</CODE>, which can created similarly.  It's
reported that the BIND 9.2.0 release candidates now require <CODE>/dev/random</CODE>
as well.  For most Linux systems, we can use the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mknod /chroot/named/dev/null c 1 3
# mknod /chroot/named/dev/random c 1 8
# chmod 666 /chroot/named/dev/{null,random}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For FreeBSD 4.3, this is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mknod /chroot/named/dev/null c 2 2
# mknod /chroot/named/dev/random c 2 3
# chmod 666 /chroot/named/dev/{null,random}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You also need another file in the <CODE>/etc</CODE> directory inside the jail.  You
must copy <CODE>/etc/localtime</CODE> (this is sometimes known as
<CODE>/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</CODE> on some systems) in there so that BIND logs
things with the right time on them.  The following command will take care
of this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp /etc/localtime /chroot/named/etc/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="logging"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Logging</A>
</H2>

<P>Unlike a conventional jailbird, BIND can't just scribble its log entries on the
walls :-).  Normally, BIND logs through <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, the system logging daemon.
However, this type of logging is performed by sending the log entries to the
special socket <CODE>/dev/log</CODE>.  Since this is outside the jail, BIND can't use
it any more.  Fortuantely, there are a couple options to work around this.
<P>
<H3>The Ideal Solution</H3>

<P>The ideal solution to this dilemma requires a reasonably recent version of
<CODE>syslogd</CODE> which supports the <CODE>-a</CODE> switch introduced by OpenBSD.
Check the manpage for your <CODE>syslogd(8)</CODE> to see if you have such a
version.
<P>If you do, all you have to do is add the switch ``<CODE>-a
/chroot/named/dev/log</CODE>'' to the command line when you launch <CODE>syslogd</CODE>.
On systems which use a full SysV-init (which includes most Linux distributions),
this is typically done in the file <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog</CODE>.  For example,
on my Red Hat Linux system, I changed the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
daemon syslogd -m 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
daemon syslogd -m 0 -a /chroot/named/dev/log
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Interestingly, as of Red Hat 7.2, Red Hat has apparently made this process
even easier.  There is now a file called <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/syslog</CODE> in which
extra parameters for syslogd can be defined.
<P>On Caldera OpenLinux systems, they use a daemon launcher called <CODE>ssd</CODE>,
which reads configuration from <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/daemons/syslog</CODE>.  You
simply need to modify the options line to look like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
OPTIONS_SYSLOGD="-m 0 -a /chroot/named/dev/log"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similarly, on SuSE systems, I'm told that the best place to add this switch
is in the <CODE>/etc/rc.config</CODE> file.  Changing the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SYSLOGD_PARAMS=""
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to read
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
SYSLOGD_PARAMS="-a /chroot/named/dev/log"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

should do the trick.
<P>And, last but not least, for FreeBSD 4.3 you can apparently just edit the
<CODE>rc.conf</CODE> file and put in the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
syslogd_flags="-s -l /chroot/named/dev/log"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>-s</CODE> is for security reasons, and is part of the default settings.
The <CODE>-l</CODE> is a local path on which to put another logging node.
<P>Once you've figured out how to make this change for your system, simply
restart <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, either by killing it and launching it again (with
the extra parameters), or by using the SysV-init script to do it for you:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog stop
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog start
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once it's been restarted, you should see a ``file'' in <CODE>/chroot/named/dev</CODE>
called <CODE>log</CODE>, that looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
srw-rw-rw-   1 root     root            0 Mar 13 20:58 log
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>The Other Solutions</H3>

<P>If you have an older <CODE>syslogd</CODE>, then you'll have to find another way to do
your logging.  There are a couple programs out there, such as <CODE>holelogd</CODE>,
which are designed to help by acting as a ``proxy'' and accepting log entries
from the chrooted BIND and passing them out to the regular <CODE>/dev/log</CODE>
socket.
<P>Alteratively, you can simply configure BIND to log to files instead of going
through syslog.  See the BIND documentation for more details if you choose to go
this route.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="perm"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Tightening Permissions</A>
</H2>

<P>First of all, feel free to restrict access to the whole <CODE>/chroot</CODE>
directory to the <CODE>root</CODE> user.  Of course, not everybody may want to do
this, especially if you have other software installed in that tree that
doesn't appreciate it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chown root /chroot
# chmod 700 /chroot
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can also safely restrict access to <CODE>/chroot/named</CODE> to the <CODE>named</CODE>
user.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chown named:named /chroot/named
# chmod 700 /chroot/named
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For even more tightening, on Linux systems we can make a few of the files and
directories immutable, using the <CODE>chattr</CODE> tool on ext2 filesystems.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /chroot/named
# chattr +i etc etc/localtime var
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Equivalently, on FreeBSD 4.3, you want to look into <CODE>chflags</CODE> if you
wish to make things immutable.  As an example, the following should change
everything in the <CODE>/chroot/named/etc</CODE> directory to immutable:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# chflags schg /chroot/named/etc/*(*).
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It would be nice to do this for the <CODE>dev</CODE> directory too, but unfortunately
that would prevent <CODE>syslogd</CODE> from creating its <CODE>dev/log</CODE> socket.
You may also choose to set the immutable bit on other files in the jail as
well, such as your primary zone files, if they aren't expected to change.
