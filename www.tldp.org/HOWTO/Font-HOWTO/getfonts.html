>9.2.1. Dealing With Mac and Windows Formats</H3
><P
>Many foundries ship fonts with Windows and Mac users in mind. This can sometimes pose a problem. Typically, the ``Windows fonts'' are fairly easy to handle, because they are packed in a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>zip</TT
> file. The only work to be done is converting the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pfm</TT
> file to and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>afm</TT
> file (using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pfm2afm</TT
>).</P
><P
>Macintosh fonts are more problematic, because they are typically made available in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.sit.bin</TT
> format -- stuffit archives. Unfortunately, there is no tool for Linux that can unpack stuffit archives created with the newer version of stuffit. The only way to do it is run Executor (Mac emulator), or try running stuffit in dosemu or Wine. Once the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sit.bin</TT
> file is unpacked, the Macintosh files can be converted using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>t1unmac</TT
> which comes with the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>t1utils</TT
> package.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, some vendors only ship Type 1 fonts in Macintosh format (stuffit archives). However, according to font expert <A
HREF="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/"

>Luc Devroye</A

Unfortunately, several of these have afm files which have mistakes and are missing all kerning pairs (you can fix the afms by editing the "FontName" section of the afm files. It should match the fontname given in the font shape file. Of course, adding kerning pairs is a topic beyond the scope of this document.)</P

>9.2.3.1. Value vs Premium: Why Should I buy Premium Fonts ?</H4
><P
>So you're wondering -- why do some fonts cost a lot and others are cheap? These fonts are the ``standard PostScript fonts'' resident in most PostScript printers. Also the famous Why should I buy the more expensive ones? My take on it is that for a casual user, the value fonts (such as those on the Bitstream CD) are just fine. However, if you're using the fonts for ``real work'', or you're just a hard core font junkie, then the better quality fonts are a must-have -- and most of the quality fonts are either free (for example, Computer Modern), or they are upmarket commercial fonts.</P
><P
>The advantage of the cheaper fonts is self evident -- they are cheaper. The quality fonts also have their advantages though.
						<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;									<EM
>Ethical issues:</EM
> The cheaper fonts are almost always ripoffs. Type design takes a long time and and experienced designer. Fonts that are sold for less than $1-per font were almost certainly not designed by the vendor. CDs with insane quantities of fonts on the are almost always ripoffs	 (the possible exceptions being collections from major foundries that cost thousands of dollars). Usually, the ripoffs lack the quality of fonts from respectable founries.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;									<EM
>Completeness:</EM
> The higher quality fonts (notably from Adobe) come in several variants, with some nice supplements to provide the user with a more complete font family. There are often bold, italic, and demibold variants, swash capitals, small caps, old style figures, and extra ligatures to supplement the font. More recently, Adobe have a multiple master technology which gives the user (almost) infinite variation within one font family.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;									<EM
>Quality:</EM
> A lot of the freely available fonts or the cheap ripoffs lack fairly essential features such as kerning pairs and decent ligatures. They are basically cheap copies. In contrast, reputable designers take a lot of trouble to study the original design, and rework it to the best of their ability.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;									<EM
>Authenticity:</EM
> The person who designed Adobe Garamond (Robert Slimbach) actually studied the original designs of Claude Garamond. In fact reputable foundries always carefully research their designs, rather than just swiping something off the net, and modifying it with Fontographer.</P
