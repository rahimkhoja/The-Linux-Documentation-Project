<A NAME="_Toc465765693"></A> <P>Graphic tablets are now quite inexpensive and can help allot with the work of
image manipulation. In addition to that what a mouse can do for you they have
the following features:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>pressure and tilt sensitivity</LI>
<LI>high resolution motion control</LI>
<LI>sub-pixel positioning</LI>
<LI>an input device that looks like and is handled like a normal Pen.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This document addresses mainly the products from Wacom, because I own 3
different products of them and because their products are highly available in
the region of Europe.
<P>Nevertheless I think it should be easy to adapt the shown concepts to other
products.
<P>
<P>I have written this document because I have not found a document about this
subject which contained completely what I wanted to know.
So I got small parts of information from various people in the
net and assembled them to this HOWTO. Regarding the questions of
my readers, I must realize that this document also is not complete and never
will be. But from the same questions I can tell that it helped many people on
the way, and each new question lets this HOWTO grow.
