>7. KDE</H1
><P
>Historically, the K Desktop Environment (KDE) was the first
    full Tamil user interface. Though far from complete, KDE was
    there for Tamil, and Tamil among the Indic languages, for the first time. 
    Under KDE, with your localization properly set to Tamil, you may be 
    able to do almost everything (from editing files, to browsing the web 
    and e-mail, to administrative tasks such as user management and task
    scheduling) with a Tamil user interface.</P

>7.1. Getting Localization Files</H2
><P
>For the newbie, it is very easy to search the web for
      Tamil KDE localizations RPMs. They are usually labelled
      something like <TT
CLASS="filename"
>kde-i18n-Tamil-2.0-1mdk.i586.rpm</TT
>.
      <TT
CLASS="varname"
>i18n</TT
> is just that: i(nternationalizatio)n, 
      18(18letters).  <TT
CLASS="varname"
>Tamil</TT
> is the
      localization setting corresponding to the Tamil language.
      <TT
CLASS="varname"
>mdk</TT
> signifies the package for Mandrake distribution. 
      Then comes the most important part; <TT
CLASS="varname"
>2.0-1</TT
>, 
      the KDE version number. Your base KDE version and this should be 
      the same, so when downloading, make sure that you get the proper 
      localized menus for the proper KDE version. <TT
CLASS="varname"
>i586</TT
> 
      signifies the precompiled binaries for the intel 586 platforms. Make sure
      that you get the proper binary (there are usually source rpms
      and rpms for other platforms such as alpha). If you are a
      newbie you are better off using GUI based rpm installer such
      as GNORPM or KPackage. First do a test install and check if
      your system has all the needed packages. If not go to the
      same source from where you downloaded the Tamil localization
      and get them. After making sure that you installed all
      dependencies, install the kde-i18n-tamil package as
      well.</P
><P
>If you are not a newbie, you know it. Get KDE Tamil
      i18n files, and if you have time, get the sources and compile
      them!</P
><P
>KDE localization uses TSCII 1.6 encoding. This means
      that you will need at least one TSCII font. Read the section
      on fonts as to how to get it.</P

>7.4. KDE Miscellaneous</H2
><P
>As with every other project, KDE-Tamil also needs a lot of
      volunteers. Contact either Sivakumar or Vaseeharan (both of
      them can be reached through the egroup</P
><P
> Visit <A
HREF="http://groups.yahoogroups.com/groups/tamilinix"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;      </A
> before you try KDE Tamil. If you want to convince yourself (and 
      be bowled over), view the screenshots from tamillinux.org site.</P
><P
>KDE's i18n process is unicode-based. As a work around,
      Trolltech's QTsciiCodec class provides conversion to and from
      the Tamil TSCII encoding. This codec uses the mapping table
      found at <A
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/tsciiset.html"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;      </A
>. Unfortunately Tamil uses composed Unicode. As such, Unicode
      fonts cannot be used under KDE-TSCII; you need to have TSCII
      fonts. The TSCII codec was contributed to Qt by Hans Petter
