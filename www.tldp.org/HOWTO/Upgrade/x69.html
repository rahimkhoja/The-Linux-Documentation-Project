>(Another possible strategy is to back up all files with mtime or
ctime more recent than the day of the previous linux installation,
as mentioned above, and then restore from that.  If you do that,
you have to take into account that the new linux distribution may
contain versions of some files that are newer still than the ones
you saved.)

>My machine was relatively easy in that there were no spool files to
worry about.  I don't run a news spool on this box, and since there
are only two users, it was easiest just to get all the mail read
before shutting down.  Otherwise, /var/spool directories would have
had to be backed up at the last minute.  (And, of course, the news
library and site directories!)
