how to set it up, and want to get going. There are few things you should

>&#13;There is only a limited amount I can tell you about your security needs:
Everybody faces different threats. All I can do here is give some basic
background on how to secure a mock mainframe setup. If you are looking for
a good general introduction to security, try the book <EM
>Secrets &#38; Lies</EM

by Bruce Schneier.

>6.1.1. Needs revisited</H3
><P
>&#13;In most books on securing computer systems, there comes a point where the
author tells you to sit down and "formulate a security policy". This sounds
like such a bureaucratic nightmare that most people skip the whole chapter.
I'm not going to suggest you formulate anything. But the next time you're
taking a shower, ask yourself what kind of defenses you need.
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>What are you trying to protect?</STRONG
> Are you worried about somebody hacking
into the mock mainframe and stealing your data, the classic Hollywood
threat to computers? Or that your hardware could be destroyed by lightning?
Or that somebody will sit down in front of a terminal when the user is off
to the bathroom and write emails in his name? Or that people will open the
computer cases and steal the processors?  Another way to look at this is to
figure out what parts of the system would be hard or even impossible for
you to do without. For example, the digital photos and films of my daughter
when she was a baby are simply irreplaceable.
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>Who or what are the forces of evil?</STRONG
> Once you know what you are trying to
protect, think about whom you are protecting it against, maybe while you
are brushing your teeth. Are you worried about crackers from the Internet,
or that the flaky power company you are stuck with will zap your computers
with a power surge? Remember those little kids with popsicle sticks?
</P
><P
>&#13;If your system is connected to the Internet 24/7, you need to worry about
worms and crackers. If you are only online for as long as it takes to pick
up those three emails from your mother, you risk in this area is
drastically reduced.  This shows how the "probability" of an attack figures
in.  How likely is it for somebody to hit your system during those 20
seconds?  If an attack is highly improbable, you won't want to go to the
effort of protecting yourself against it. Some things you will probably
dismiss without even thinking: Just how were you going to defend your
system against attacks by rust monsters?
</P
><P
>&#13;Once you know what you are afraid of and how probable an attack is, you
should have a feeling for the <EM
>risks</EM
> you are facing.  There are three ways
of handling risk: You can <EM
>take it</EM
>, <EM
>minimize it</EM
>, or <EM
>insure against it</EM
>.
The first option is not as negligent as you might think: Given our budget,
most of us are simply taking the risk of meteor strikes. The third option
usually costs money, which we don't have, so we will ignore it here.
</P
><P
>&#13;The second option is touches the three major parts of any security process:
<EM
>prevention</EM
>, <EM
>detection</EM
>, and <EM
>response</EM
>. Most computer security deals
with prevention: Making sure the cases are locked so nobody can steal the
CPUs, for example. Detection is usually skimped &#8212; when is the last time
you looked at one of the files in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/var/log/</TT
>?  &#8212; and usually little
thought is given to the response, because people figure none of this is
going to happen anyway.  Unfortunately, you need all three, always, at
least to some extent.
</P
><P
>&#13;Even if you decide that detection systems like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>tripwire</TT
> are too much of a
hassle to install and you don't have the time to read log files every day,
give some thought to how you could tell that your system has been
compromised. In some cases, it will be hard to miss, say, when men with
badges knock at your door and take you away because your computer has been
sending spam related to an improbable sexual act with squirrels to all of
South Korea. Other intrusions might be more subtle.  Would you know if
somebody copied the files from your letter folder?
</P
><P
>&#13;Think about how you would respond to at least the most likely attacks and
failures. What would you do if your hard disk crashed? If you logged in as
root and the system told you that your last log in was on Friday &#8212; except
that you were still in London, England on Friday, singing drinking songs as
you happily stumbled from one pub to the next.  With a normal home system
and good backups, you might be able to get away with <EM
>reinstall from scratch</EM
>
as the standard response all problems great or small (but
make sure that your backups are not compromised).
</P
><P
>&#13;By the time you are putting on your socks, you'll have probably found out
that your greatest risks are quite different from those the press talks
about all of the time.  If you have no Microsoft products on your network,
you don't have to worry too much about anti-virus software or Active X
vulnerabilities. However, Linux does not enjoy any special bonuses when it
comes to power surges, flooding, or broken fans.

>6.1.2. Security Principles</H3
><P
>&#13;Back to prevention: When you design your system, keep these security
principles in mind:
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>Building better baskets.</STRONG
> Putting all of your files on one computer might
seem like putting all of your eggs in one basket, which proverbial
grandmothers say is a bad thing to do. In fact, from a security point
of view, this can actually be a good strategy: Since it is almost always
easier to defend one thing than it is to defend many, one basket my be fine
as long as you make sure that is a <EM
>very, very good</EM
> basket.
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>Avoiding complexity.</STRONG
> A centralized system is usually less complex to set
up and to administer: If you have all of your users on one machine, you
don't have to worry about network file systems, network logins, network
printers, and all other kinds of clever but complicated ways to connect
computers. Keeping things simple keeps things safe. This is true as well
for the support machines: They should do one job and one job only.
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>Encapsulation.</STRONG
> This is the process of isolating a part of the system so
that if it is compromised, the whole of the system doesn't go down with it.
The Guardian is an example of encapsulation: The dangerous work of
connecting to the Internet is handled by a cheap, expendable machine that
gives attackers few tools to work with. Another example is taking those
parts of the system that the user can actually touch with his grubby little
hands &#8212; monitor, keyboard, and mouse &#8212; and putting them on a Linux
Terminal. The mock mainframe setup, however, is obviously not that good at
encapsulation: The whole idea of doing everything on one machine runs
contrary to this concept.
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>Defense in Depth.</STRONG
> Preventative security measures are only ways of buying
time until your response kicks in &#8212; given enough uninterrupted time, the
attacker will always win. To increase the time you have to respond, deploy
your defenses in depth: After the attacker has trekked through kilometers
of dense jungle, he reaches the moat which surrounds a twenty meter high
outside wall, which is followed by a mine field and poisoned bamboo spikes.
And in the end, the secret plans to your magical chocolate machine will not
only be in code, but also written in invisible ink. That's defense in
depth.
</P
><P
>&#13;The guardian is an extention of your defenses; installing a second firewall
on the mock mainframe is another one. It might sound trivial, but use
different passwords for the mock mainframe and the guardian. If you have
other support machines, putting them on a different network also means more
room between them and the attacker. If you have data that you have to keep
confidential at all costs (wink-wink nudge-nudge), encrypt it, or at least
those backup CDs.  After a few years of backups, you won't know where they
have all ended up.
</P
><P
>&#13;But keep in mind that even the deepest defenses only buy you more time. As
Indiana Jones and Lara Croft will tell you, getting by the preventative
measures is the easy part: All you need is a whip or a few well-timed
jumps. The problems start when the locals start shouting and the guys with
the guns arrive.
</P
><P
>&#13;<STRONG
>Choke Points.</STRONG
> If there is only one way to get into the system and you can
control that way completely, that system will be easier to secure in time
of danger. We turn to the guardian one more time for an example of a choke
point: Turn off the machine, and you are safe from Internet villains,
<EM
>provided it is really the only access point</EM
>. The problem with many
networks is that somewhere, somebody has a connection to the outside that
the system administrator doesn't know about. Think of all the laptops that
now come with a modem or, even worse, a wireless LAN card built in.
Connect those laptops to your net, and you have an instant back door.
Remember your history: Your main gate can be high and strong and crawling
with orcs, but miss one single little spider hole, and two hobbits can ruin
your whole day.

>6.2. Network Hardware</H2
><P
>&#13;If you are setting up a network from scratch, go with Fast Ethernet. The
cables and network cards are not that much more expensive than the older,
10 MBit/sec Ethernet. X Windows is bandwidth-hungry, and needs always grow
before they shrink.
</P
><P
>&#13;One note about running X terminals over a wireless LAN: I have been told in no uncertain words to avoid this. Two problems are mentioned: Variable bandwidth, which can leave your session slowing to a crawl when your neighbor does something major, and dropouts, which can lead to the whole session being shut down with all X programs using the connection terminated and your work gone. There are also the usual caveats about the security of WiFi connections.

>6.3. Network Geography</H2
><P
>&#13;You can make life a little easer for yourself by picking a sane and
systematic way to name your computers: Pick a set of addresses for your
system based on what each machine does.  Internally, use the IPv4 address
space of 192.168.<STRONG
>.</STRONG
> that is reserved for networks without direct contact
to the Internet.  For example, let's take 192.168.1.*. The mock mainframe
could be 192.168.1.1, the support machines 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.19,
and the terminals 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199.  This way, you can
immediately see the type of computer based on the IPv4 number, and the less
trusted a machine is, the larger the last number will be.
</P
><P
>&#13;Combine this with a naming system that is easy to use. For example, you can
name the mock mainframe <EM
>fatcat</EM
> and the terminals <EM
>kitten00</EM
> to <EM
>kitten99</EM
>
(with IPv4 numbers from 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.199). Giving the support
machines names based on their function is probably easier than something
systematic. In the feline theme, try <EM
>claws</EM
> for a guardian machine or
<EM
>mamacat</EM
> for a terminal mother.
