<P>Evolutionary computing is actually a broad term for a vast
array of programming techniques, including genetic algorithms,
complex adaptive systems, evolutionary programming, etc.
The main thrust of all these techniques is the idea of
evolution. The idea that a program can be written that will
<I>evolve</I> toward a certain goal.  This goal can be
anything from solving some engineering problem to winning a
game.</P>

<P>These are libraries of code or classes for use in programming within
the evolutionary computation field.  They are not meant as stand alone
applications, but rather as tools for building your own applications.</P>

<P>A collection of programs using evolved artificial neural networks to
solve a series of problems. The long term goal of the project is to
advance our level of understanding about simulated evolution as a means
to configure and optimize Artificial Neural Nets (ANNs). The medium
term goal is to apply our methods to a series of interesting problems
such as sail boat piloting and playing the game NIM.</P>
<P>A secondary goal is educational in nature. We attempt to write our
software with ample explanation, not just for the user, but for the
engineer/programmer/scientist who wants to understand the innermost
detail. All of the source code is freely available to anyone to use
without restriction.</P>

<P>EAP has been built using the Python and UNIX programming philosophies
in order to provide a transparent, simple and coherent environment for
implementing your favourite evolutionary algorithms. EAP is very easy
to use even for those who do not know much about the Python programming
language. EAP uses the object oriented paradigm that is provided by
Python in order to make development simple and beautiful.  It also
contains a 15 illustrative and diversified examples, to help newcomers
to ramp up very quickly in using this environment.</P>
<P>It includes Genetic Algorithms using any imaginable representation,
Genetic Programming with strongly and loosely typed trees in addition
to automatically defined functions, Evolution Strategies (including
Covariance Matrix Adaptation), multiobjective optimization techniques
(NSGA-II and SPEA2), easy parallelization of algorithms and much more
like milestones, genealogy, etc.</P>

<P>daga is an experimental release of a 2-level genetic algorithm
compatible with the GALOPPS GA software. It is a meta-GA which
dynamically evolves a population of GAs to solve a problem presented to
the lower-level GAs. When multiple GAs (with different operators,
parameter settings, etc.) are simultaneously applied to the same
problem, the ones showing better performance have a higher probability
of surviving and "breeding" to the next macro-generation (i.e.,
spawning new "daughter"-GAs with characteristics inherited from the
parental GA or GAs.  In this way, we try to encourage good
problem-solving strategies to spread to the whole population of GAs.</P>

<P>DEAP is intended to be an easy to use distributed evolutionary
algorithm library in the Python language. Its two main components are
modular and can be used separately. The first module is a Distributed
Task Manager (DTM), which is intended to run on cluster of computers
using TCP or a MPI connection. The second part is the Evolutionary
Algorithms in Python (EAP) framework. EAP is the evolutionary core of
DEAP, it provides data structures, methods and tools to design any kind
of evolutionary algorithm. It works in perfect harmony with DTM,
allowing easy parallelization of any demanding evolutionary task.</P>

<P>The Distributed Genetic Programming Framework (DGPF) is a scalable Java
environment for heuristic, simulation-based search algorithms of any
kind and Genetic Algorithms in special. We use the broad foundation of
a search algorithms layer to provide a Genetic Programming system which
is able to create Turing-complete code.</P>
<P>It's under the LGPL license. It allows you to use heuristic searches
like GA and randomized Hill Climbing for any problem space you like to
with just minimal programming effort. Also, you may distribute all
these searches over a network, using the client/server, the
peer-to-peer, or even a client/server+ peer-to-peer hybrid distribution
scheme. You also can construct heterogeneous search algorithms where GA
cooperates with Hill Climbing without changing any code.</P>

<P>This program is a FORTRAN version of a genetic algorithm driver.
This code initializes a random sample of individuals with
different parameters to be optimized using the genetic algorithm
approach, i.e.  evolution via survival of the fittest.  The
selection scheme used is tournament selection with a shuffling
technique for choosing random pairs for mating.  The routine
includes binary coding for the individuals, jump mutation, creep
mutation, and the option for single-point or uniform crossover.
Niching (sharing) and an option for the number of children per
pair of parents has been added.  More recently, an option for
the use of a micro-GA has been added.</P>

<P>Small genetic programming library in C++ and ActionScript 3 (Javascript
engine embedded in Flash) with flash demos.</P>
<P>This GP library uses the standard Koza expression tree program
representation. It uses the 'grow' algorithm to generate random
expressions. Mutation is performed by selecting a random subexpression
in an expression tree, and replacing it with a new random expression
(which satisfies the maximum tree depth constraint). Crossover (mating)
between two expressions is performed by selecting a random
subexpression in each parent, then exchanging them (although it only
makes on child, not two).</P>
<P>In addition to the core code for creating, mutating, mating and
evaluating expressions, the library includes a steady-state genetic
algorithm with tournament selection, and a worst-out, elitist
replacement policy (i.e. when a new child is created, it replaces the
worse member of the population, only if it is better). </P>

<P>ADATE (Automatic Design of Algorithms Through Evolution) is a system 
for automatic programming i.e., inductive inference of algorithms, 
which may be the best way to develop artificial and general 
intelligence.</P>

<P>The ADATE system can automatically generate non-trivial and novel
algorithms. Algorithms are generated through large scale combinatorial
search that employs sophisticated program transformations and
heuristics. The ADATE system is particularly good at synthesizing
symbolic, functional programs and has several unique qualities.</P>

<P>This is a new scheduler, called Evolution Scheduler, based on
Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Programming. It lives with
original Linux priority scheduler.This means you don't have to
reboot to change the scheduling policy. You may simply use the
manager program esep to switch between them at any time, and
esep itself is an all-in-one for scheduling status, commands,
and administration. We didn't intend to remove the original
priority scheduler; instead, at least, esep provides you with
another choice to use a more intelligent scheduler, which
carries out natural competition in an easy and effective way.</P>
<P>Xesep is a graphical user interface to the esep (Evolution
Scheduling and Evolving Processes). It's intended to show users
how to start, play, and feel the Evolution Scheduling and
Evolving Processes, including sub-programs to display system
status, evolving process status, queue status, and evolution
scheduling status periodically in as small as one mini-second.</P>

<P>JCASim is a general-purpose system for simulating cellular automata in
Java. It includes a stand-alone application and an applet for web
presentations. The cellular automata can be specified in Java, in CDL,
or using an interactive dialogue. The system supports many different
lattice geometries (1-D, 2-D square, hexagonal, triangular, 3-D),
neighborhoods, boundary conditions, and can display the cells using
colors, text, or icons.</P>
