<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Formatting</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Before a tape can be used, it must be formatted.  The formatting
process lays out sector information onto the tape.  Other tape
interfaces don't typically require formatting.  The reason floppy
tapes do is that they need to look like a floppy (kinda gross, but
what the hey - it works :-).
<P>
<P>
<H3>Can I format my tapes under Linux?</H3>

<P>
<P>Yes, you can, if you use <CODE>ftape-3.04d</CODE> or above. To format a floppy
tape cartridge you need a user level tool called <CODE>ftformat</CODE> as well
which is contained in the <CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> distribution (see section
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-4.html#getting">Getting ftape</A>).
<P>The <CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package comes with its own manual, so I do not need 
to repeat here how to use <CODE>ftformat</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>Which formatting programs can I use under DOS?</H3>

<P>
<P>The following are known to work:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Colorado Memory System's software (<CODE>tape.exe</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Conner Backup Basics v1.1 and all Windows versions</LI>
<LI> Norton Backup</LI>
<LI> QICstream version 2</LI>
<LI> Tallgrass FileSecure v1.52</LI>
<LI> Escom Powerstream 3.0 (<CODE>qs3.exe</CODE> -- QICstream v3?)</LI>
</UL>
<P>These programs are known to be more or less buggy:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Conner Backup Basics 1.0</LI>
<LI> Colorado Windows tape program</LI>
<LI> CP Backup (wastes tape space, but is OK apart from that)</LI>
</UL>
<P>As a general rule, most software under DOS should work.  The Conner
Backup Basics v1.0 has a parameter off by one (someone could not read
the QIC-80 specs right!), which is corrected in version 1.1.  However,
<CODE>ftape</CODE> detects this, and will work around it.  Dennis T. Flaherty
(<CODE>&lt;dennisf@denix.elk.miles.com&gt;</CODE>) report that Conner C250MQ
owners can obtain the new v1.1, by calling Conner at 1-800-4Conner (in
the US) and ask for an upgrade (for a nominal fee for the floppy).
The Windows versions should work fine.  Some versions of Colorado's
tape program for windows, has an off-by-one error in the number of
segments. <CODE>ftape</CODE> also detect and work around that bug.
<P>Central Point Backup can be used, but it wastes precious tape space
when it encounters a bad spot on the tape.
<P>NOTE: If you are running a formatting software under DOS, which is not
mentioned here, please mail the relevant info to me (
<A HREF="mailto:heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de">&lt;heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de&gt;</A>), so I can update the list.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Retensioning</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>QIC tapes are particularly sensitive to tape stretch.  The reason is
that floppy tapes are pre-formatted with sector information, whereas
other tape types have their sync information written as the data is
written to the tape.  If the floppy tape stretches and the sync fields
get out of sync the result will be read errors.  The problem is worse
with longer tapes.
<P>It is a good idea to retension new tapes a few times before using them
and before formatting them.  You should also try retensioning the tape
if you are start getting read errors.  It might also be a good idea
retension the tape before a backup.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Drive Cleaning</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The coating on the tape is an oxide compound.  As the tape is dragged
across the tape head it has a tendency to leave tiny amounts of
residue on the head.  You should periodically use a tape cleaner -
following the specs for the drive in question.  Tape cleaners should
be available from any distributer of tapes.
<P>One more additional note about tape cleaning.  You might want to clean
the drive after the first use of a brand new tape.  A brand new tape
will typically leave quite a bit of residue the first time it's used.
<P>Thanks to 
<A HREF="mailto:nealf@rcs.ee.washington.edu">Neal Friedman</A> for the explanation and suggestion that this information be
included in the HOWTO.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Repairing de-spooled cartridges</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In rare occasions it can happen that the tape drive doesn't detect the
<B>EOT</B> (End Of Tape) markers correctly. These markers are simply
holes in the tape which are detected by the tape drive with means of a
little photo-transistor (or the like).
<P>The manual of your tape drive will probably give you proper hints how
to clean those EOT detectors.
<P>However, if the EOT detection fails, then the tape drive despooles the
cartridge because the tape isn't glued to the wheels, but hold by
friction only.
<P>There are detailed instructions how to fix such a despooled tape at
the Iomega WWW pages at
