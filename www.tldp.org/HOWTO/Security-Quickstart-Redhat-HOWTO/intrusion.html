NAME="IDS">6.1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</H2
><P
> Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS for short) are designed to catch what might
 have gotten past the firewall. They can either be designed to catch an 
 active break-in attempt in progress, or to detect a successful break-in 
 after the fact. In the latter case, it is too late to prevent any damage, but
 at least we have early awareness of a problem. There are two basic types of
 IDS: those protecting networks, and those protecting individual hosts.&#13;</P
><P
> For host based IDS, this is done with utilities that monitor the filesystem
 for changes. System files that have changed in some way, but should not
 change -- unless we did it -- are a dead give away that something is amiss.
 Anyone who gets in, and gets root, will presumably make changes to the system
 somewhere. This is usually the very first thing done. Either so he can get
 back in through a backdoor, or to launch an attack against someone else. In
 which case, he has to change or add files to the system. &#13;</P
><P
> This is where tools like tripwire (<A
HREF="http://www.tripwire.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.tripwire.org</A
>) play a role.
  Tripwire is included beginning with Red Hat 7.0. 
 Such tools monitor various aspects of the filesystem, and compare them against a
 stored database. And can be configured to send an alert if
 <EM
>any</EM
> changes are detected. Such tools should only be 
 installed on a known <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clean"</SPAN
> system. &#13;</P
><P
> For home desktops and home LANs, this is probably not an absolutely necessary
 component of an overall security strategy. But it does give peace of mind, and
 certainly does have its place. So as to priorities, make sure the Steps 1, 2
 and 3 above are implemented and verified to be sound, before delving into
 this.&#13;</P
><P
> We can
 get somewhat the same results with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -Va</TT
>, which will
 verify all packages, but without all the same functionality. For instance, it
 will not notice new files added to most directories. Nor will it detect 
 files that have had the extended attributes changed (e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>chattr +i</TT
>, 
 man <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>chattr</B
> and man <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lsattr</B
>). For this to
 be helpful, it needs to be done after a clean install, and then each time any
 packages are upgraded or added. Example:&#13;</P

 There are many prepackaged rootkits available on the Internet. 
 The rootkit is essentially a script, or set of scripts, that makes quick work
 of modifying the system so the intruder is in control, and he is well hidden.
 He does this by installing modified binaries of common system utilities and
 tampering with log files. Or by using special kernel modules that achieve
 similar results. So common commands like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls</B
> may be
 modified so as to not show where he has his files stored. Clever! &#13;</P
><P
> A well designed rootkit can be quite effective. Nothing on the system can
 really be trusted to provide accurate feedback. Nothing! But sometimes the
 modifications are not as smooth as intended and give hints that something is
 not right. Some things that <EM

   suspicious. Similarly, any weirdness with adding or changing passwords.
  </P
><P
>   Wierdness with other system commands (e.g. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>top</B

   <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ps</B

  </P
></LI

>   System utilities are slower, or awkward, or show strange and unexpected 
   results. Common utilities that might be modified are: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

   <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

 Often such left behind files, or log entries, will have obvious

 binaries, and the output of system utilities is not to be trusted. Nothing on

 individual packages may or may not help since it could be system libraries
 or kernel modules that are doing the dirty work. The point here is that there
 is no way to know with absolute certainty exactly what components have been
 altered. </P

 use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
