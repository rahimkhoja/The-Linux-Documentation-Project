<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The technique</A></H2>

<P>Throughout this description I will refer to two machines as ``<CODE>msdos</CODE>''
and ``<CODE>linux</CODE>''. ``<CODE>msdos</CODE>'' is the name of the machine
which has the tape drive and is usually running MS-DOS.
``<CODE>linux</CODE>'' is the Linux machine whose disk
you are trying to back up or restore to the tape drive.
For simplicity I will refer to the first machine as ``<CODE>msdos</CODE>''
even when it is booted into and running Linux.
Further, all path names in this document should be considered
to be relative to the Linux machine with the Search-And-Rescue (SAR)
disks mounted somewhere on the system.
That means that the file <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> is the password file for
your Linux machine's hard drive, while, for instance,
<CODE>/tape144/etc/passwd</CODE> is the corresponding file on the floppy disk.
<P>
<P>I am using Karel Kubat's backup scripts, version 1.03, available at
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.enc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Backup/backup-1.03.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.enc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Backup/backup-1.03.tar.gz</A></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Throughout this document I will refer to these simply as
``<CODE>the backup scripts</CODE>''.
You do not have to use these scripts for your own backups to tape.
I like these scripts as they use afio to form
an uncompressed archive of compressed files,
rather than a compressed archive of uncompressed files.
The former is much safer if there is a media read error during the restore.
I understand that Karel is no longer supporting backup,
and now has produced 'tob', or tape oriented backup.
While I haven't tried the new package myself,
it cannot make a significant difference to the procedure outlined here.
<P>First of all, obtain the ftape module. It is a part of all modern kernels,
but if you are using an older kernel you can find the module at:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes/ftape-2.05.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes/ftape-2.05.tar.gz</A></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next, get a Slackware boot disk
(I got the net disk, but it doesn't make much difference) and
the <CODE>tape144</CODE> root disk,
and put the images onto 3&quot;1/2 floppies.
<P>The <CODE>ftape</CODE> module will only work
if it is installed in the kernel which was running when you compiled it.
I could not get it to work with the <CODE>ftape.o</CODE> module on
the <CODE>tape144</CODE> root disk,
I think because that module has been stripped of symbols and won't install.
So, you now have to make a new kernel with network and ftape support,
and if you're running an old kernel, a new <CODE>ftape.o</CODE>.
Read the directions which ship with the <CODE>ftape</CODE> archive for
directions at this stage.
Remember that the kernel you compile must support the Ethernet cards
on both the Linux machine and the MS-DOS machine.
<P>Copy the newly created kernel image over top of the one on the Net boot disk.
Use <CODE>/bin/cp</CODE>, do not create a boot disk with the ``<CODE>dd</CODE>''
command as you would to create a bootable kernel image.
Write protect the boot disk, and label it: SAR#1.
<P>Now, mount the <CODE>tape144</CODE> root disk.
I'll assume that the mount point is <CODE>/tape144</CODE>,
to avoid confusion in file names.
We need to free some space on it, so delete the following files:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/tape144/bin/dialog
/tape144/bin/elvis
/tape144/bin/vi
/tape144/boot/ftape.o
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, create a new file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/tape144/etc/exports
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which contains the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/mnt    msdos(ro)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Where ``<CODE>msdos</CODE>'' should be replaced with the name or IP#
of the MS-DOS machine which has the tape drive installed.
<P>Next, so that you don't have to rely on a name server,
add lines to the file <CODE>/tape144/etc/hosts</CODE> with
the names and IP numbers of the Linux and MS-DOS machines.
For instance, mine contains the following two lines:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
128.100.75.114  caliban.physics.utoronto.ca caliban caliban.physics
128.100.75.111  ariel.physics.utoronto.ca ariel ariel.physics
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, there's some sort of problem with the inetd configuration.
We have to put the full path name of the rsh daemon in it.
Change line 19 of <CODE>/tape144/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> to read:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
shell   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/tcpd   /usr/etc/in.rshd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Add local net routing information to <CODE>/tape144/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</CODE>
to enable the MS-DOS machine to use the network.
The format of this depends on your network configuration,
you can just copy the appropriate format out of your Linux
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</CODE>.
For my network, the lines that have to be added are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/etc/ifconfig eth0 128.100.75.111 broadcast 128.100.75.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
/etc/route add -net 128.100.75.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The IP# in the ifconfig entry is that of the MS-DOS machine.
<P>Now, copy this file into <CODE>/tape144/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1-l</CODE>,
and change the IP# in the new file to reflect that of
the Linux machine rather than the MS-DOS machine.
<P>Next, clip out lines 3 to 11 of <CODE>/tape144/etc/rc.local</CODE>.
That's an if statement which executes the <CODE>rc.inet*</CODE> files.
We don't want this to happen during the bootup.
<P>Create a new file: <CODE>/tape144/root/.rhosts</CODE> containing the line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
linux root
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where, again, ``<CODE>linux</CODE>'' is replaced with the full machine name
(including domain) or the IP# of the Linux machine.
<P>Fill in the password field in <CODE>/tape144/etc/passwd</CODE>
for the root login to keep people from logging onto the MS-DOS machine
while you're doing the backup.
You can do this by copying the corresponding field from your Linux machine's
<CODE>/etc/passwd file</CODE>.
<P>Copy /usr/bin/rsh into /tape144/usr/bin.
<P>Copy the following files from <CODE>/usr/etc</CODE> into <CODE>/tape144/usr/etc</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
in.rshd
rpc.mountd
rpc.nfsd
rpc.portmap
services
tcpd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Create a new script, <CODE>/tape144/bin/tapesetup</CODE>,
which consists of the following:
(change ``<CODE>linux</CODE>'' to reflect your Linux machine name).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh

/bin/sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
/bin/sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2

/bin/mount linux:/nfs /mnt
/bin/insmod /mnt/ftape.o
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that newer kernels will not require the insmod line.
<P>Next, create another new script, <CODE>/tape144/bin/msdosset</CODE>, as follows:
(change ``<CODE>linux</CODE>'' to reflect your Linux machine name).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh 

/bin/sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
/bin/sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2

mount linux:/mnt /mnt
/bin/insmod /mnt/ftape.o
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

As above, newer kernels will not require the insmod line.
<P>Create a readable file, <CODE>/tape144/root/notes</CODE>,
which contains this helpful information for use in full recovery:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
For a full recovery to a trashed hard disk,
boot the Linux machine with the SAR disks #1 and #2
then type the following:

   /bin/sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1-l
   /bin/sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2

   /usr/etc/rpc.portmap
   /usr/etc/rpc.mountd
   /usr/etc/rpc.nfsd

Next, insert SAR disk #3 and type:

   mount /dev/fd0 /mnt

Create a new mount point, with:

   mkdir /mnt2

and mount your Linux hard disk partition on this point.
You may have to reformat the partition first, if so,
follow the directions in the Linux Installation HOWTO.
The SAR disks contain all the files necessary to do the reformat.

Finally, use disks SAR#1 and SAR#2 to boot up
the MS-DOS machine and run the /bin/msdosset script on that machine.
It will take about a minute to run that script because it is getting
an NSF file from a floppy drive, so be patient.
Now, recover the tape to /mnt2 on the Linux machine.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you are using the backup scripts you will need to
copy 'afio' into the <CODE>/tape144/local/bin</CODE> subdirectory.
It is not necessary to have the rest of the backup script files
on the recovery disks, an archive can be recovered using only 'afio' and 'gzip'.
<P>I was unable to use the backup scripts as they come shipped.
The tape archive appears to build cleanly, but it is unrecoverable.
I found that removing the block size and conversion statements fixed it.
Here is the patch to the ``<CODE>netbackup</CODE>'' script.
Apply this patch to the Linux machine's hard disk copy of 'netbackup'
as well as to the copy on the SAR disks.

<P>You have now finished your SAR disk #2.
Write protect it.
<P>Next, mount a clean, formatted disk
(create it with <CODE>fdformat</CODE> and <CODE>mkfs</CODE>).
Copy the <CODE>ftape.o</CODE> file onto it, and label it SAR#3.
For some reason things go badly if you write protect this disk,
so leave it write-enabled.
<P>On the Linux machine, create a new directory for NFS file serving.
I made a directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/nfs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Put the <CODE>ftape.o</CODE> (unstripped, about 500+ kB) into this subdirectory.
Create an entry in your Linux's exports file <CODE>/etc/exports</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/nfs    msdos(ro)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that all files in your NFS directory and it's subdirectories
are not secure.
Somebody else could boot the MS-DOS machine into Linux with
his own boot disks and mount this directory,
so be certain that you don't put anything sensitive in your NFS subdirectory.
<P>Restart your NFS daemons, <CODE>rpc.mountd</CODE> and <CODE>rpc.nfsd</CODE>.
They don't seem to take kindly to a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> restart,
so kill them and reinvoke them.
If you're not activating these daemons in your <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</CODE>
you might want to do so now.
<P>OK, now we're all set to back up and recover.
To make a full backup from the Linux machine,
boot the MS-DOS machine with SAR#1.
When prompted for the second disk, load SAR#2. Log in as root,
and execute the script: <CODE>/bin/tapesetup</CODE>.
Log out of the MS-DOS machine.
If you're using the backup scripts, the netbackup command will now work.
You can also use the ``<CODE>-f msdos:/dev/ftape</CODE>'' switch on GNU
<CODE>tar</CODE>, <CODE>cpio</CODE>, or <CODE>mt</CODE>, and make your backup this way.
If you have a backup program,
which is only capable of writing to a local file,
do the following.
Assume that the backup program is called ``<CODE>localbackup</CODE>'' and
writes to the file represented by its command line argument:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mknod /tmp/tapepipe p
rsh msdos dd of=/dev/ftape &lt; /tmp/tapepipe &amp;
localbackup /tmp/tapepipe
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

when it's done, delete <CODE>/tmp/tapepipe</CODE>.
<P>Recovering to a live Linux machine:
the <CODE>netbackup</CODE> script, <CODE>tar</CODE>, <CODE>cpio</CODE>,
and so on will all work without special actions on the part of the operator.
If you have a local recovery program which recovers from a file, do this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mknod /tmp/tapepipe p
rsh -n msdos dd if=/dev/ftape >> /tmp/tapepipe &amp;
localrecovery /tmp/tapepipe
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and delete <CODE>/tmp/tapepipe</CODE> when you're done.
<P>Notice that I'm using '<CODE>rsh</CODE>' to the root user on the MS-DOS machine.
This works with a correct <CODE>.rhosts</CODE> entry.
The configuration on the '<CODE>tape144</CODE>' disk allows <CODE>rsh</CODE> to root,
but does not allow <CODE>telnet</CODE> or <CODE>rlogin</CODE> to root,
logins are restricted to the console.
This is good for security.
<P>If you are worried about a root <CODE>.rhost</CODE> file,
you can create a new user on SAR#2, ``<CODE>tapeuser</CODE>'',
with permissions to operate the tape drive but not the disks
(create a new group and put tapeuser in that group,
then <CODE>chown</CODE> and <CODE>chmod</CODE> the files <CODE>/dev/rft*</CODE> and
<CODE>/dev/nrft*</CODE>).
Your backup program then has to know to <CODE>rsh</CODE> to that username
rather than to root.
Of course, now there must be an <CODE>.rhosts</CODE> file in
<CODE>~tapeuser</CODE> on SAR#2.
For my own use, I have chosen this course, rather than a root <CODE>.rhosts</CODE>.
<P>Finally, the directions for a complete recovery to a trashed hard disk.
This assumes that the Linux partition is completely unrecoverable.
If necessary, reformat that partition as described in the Linux
Installation HOWTO. Boot the Linux machine from SAR disk #1.
When prompted, insert disk #2.
Now, follow the directions in the file <CODE>/root/notes</CODE>
(this was <CODE>/tape144/root/notes</CODE> when it was mounted on
your Linux machine).
Once both machines have been booted up, run the recovery routine you need.
If you are running the backup scripts you can do it as follows:
<OL>
<LI>change directory to the mount point of the hard disk partition
which you will be recovering.</LI>
<LI>if any mounted volumes are on the backup,
and you want to recover them,
create the mount points within the hard disk partition and
mount the volumes.</LI>
<LI>Enter the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rsh -n msdos dd if=/dev/ftape | afio -i -v -Z -c 1024 -
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rsh -n -l tapeuser msdos dd if=/dev/ftape | afio -i -v -Z -c 1024 -
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mknod /tmp/backpipe p
rsh -n msdos dd if=/dev/ftape >> /tmp/backpipe &amp;
afio -i -v -Z -c 1024 /tmp/backpipe
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</OL>

This reads the tape on the remote machine, writing the result to stdout,
where <CODE>afio</CODE> picks it up.
The '<CODE>-i</CODE>' switch tells it to recover the files relative to
the current working directory (which is the root of the hard disk partition).  '<CODE>-v</CODE>' is verbose, listing the files as they are recovered.  '<CODE>-Z</CODE>' tells afio that this is an archive of individually compressed files.  '<CODE>-c 1024</CODE>' tells it to use a 5 MB streaming buffer
to avoid a lot of tape rewinding.
