<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Some of the terms used in this document.</A></H2>

<P>You will often see the terms <CODE>client</CODE> and <CODE>server</CODE> used in this
document. They are normally fairly specific terms but in this document I have
generalized their definitions a little so that they mean the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>client</B><DD><P>The machine or program that initiates an action or a
connection for the purpose of gaining use of some service or data.
<DT><B>server</B><DD><P>The machine or program that accepts incoming connections from
multiple remote machines and provides a service or data to those.
</DL>
<P>These definitions are not very reliable either, but they provide a means of
distinguishing the ends of peer to peer systems such as <EM>SLIP</EM> or
<EM>PPP</EM> which truly do not actually have clients and servers.
<P>Other terms you will see are:
<DL>
<DT><B>Bindery</B><DD><P>The <EM>bindery</EM> is a specialised database storing network
configuration information on a Novell fileserver. Netware clients may query
the <EM>bindery</EM> to obtain information on available services, routing and
user information.
<DT><B>Frame Type</B><DD><P>is a term used to describe that actual protocol used to carry
the IPX (and IP) datagrams across your ethernet style network segments. There
are four common ones. They are:
<DL>
<DT><B>Ethernet_II</B><DD><P>This is a refined version of the original DIX ethernet
standard. Novell has been allocated a formal protocol id and this means that
both IPX and IP can coexist happily in an Ethernet_II environment quite
happily. This is commonly used in Novell environments and is a good choice.
<DT><B>802.3</B><DD><P>This is an I.E.E.E. protocol defining a Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mechanism. It was based
on the original DIX Ethernet standard, with an important modification, the
type (protocol id) field was converted into a length field instead. It is
for this reason that IPX really shouldn't be run here. IEEE 802.3 was designed
to carry IEEE 802.2 frames <B>only</B> but there are implementations that use
it to carry IPX frames directly and remarkably it does work. Avoid it unless
you are trying to interwork with a network already configured to use it.
<DT><B>802.2</B><DD><P>This is an I.E.E.E. protocol that defines a set of Logical Link
Control procedures. It provides a simplistic way of allowing different
protocols to coexist, but is quite limited in this respect. Novell uses an
unofficial Service Address Point (like a protocol id) but since everyone else
uses it as well, that hasn't yet presented too much of a problem.
<DT><B>SNAP</B><DD><P>SNAP is the Sub Network Access Protocol. This protocol is
designed ride on top of 802.3 and 802.2. It expands the multiprotocol
capability of 802.2 and provides some measure of compatability with existing
Ethernet and Ethernet_II frame types.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><B>IPX</B><DD><P>Internet Packet eXchange is a protocol used by the Novell
corporation to provide internetworking support for their NetWare(tm) product.
IPX is similar in functionality to the IP protocol used by the tcp/ip
community.
<DT><B>IPX network address</B><DD><P>This is a number which uniquely identifies a
particular IPX network. The usual notation for this address is in hexadecimal.
An example might look like: <CODE>0x23a91002</CODE>.
<DT><B>IPX Internal network</B><DD><P>This is a virtual IPX network. It is virtual
because it does not correspond to a physical network. This is used to provide
a means of uniquely identifying and addressing a particular IPX host. This
is generally only useful to IPX hosts that exist on more than one physical
IPX network such as fileservers. The address is coded in the same form as
for a physical IPX network.
<DT><B>RIP</B><DD><P>Routing Information Protocol is a protocol used to automatically
propagate network routes in an IPX network. It is functionally similar to the
RIP used within the tcp/ip community.
<DT><B>NCP</B><DD><P>NetWare Core Protocol is a networked filesystem protocol designed
by the Novell Corporation for their NetWare(tm) product. NCP is functionally
similar to the NFS used in the tcp/ip community.
<DT><B>SAP</B><DD><P>Service Advertisement Protocol is a protocol designed by the
Novell Corporation that is used to advertise network services in a NetWare(tm)
environment.
<DT><B>Hardware address</B><DD><P>This is a number that uniquely identifies a host in a
physical network at the media access layer. Examples of this are
<EM>Ethernet Addresses</EM>. An Ethernet address is generally coded as six
hexadecimal values separated by colon characters eg. <CODE>00:60:8C:C3:3C:0F</CODE>
<DT><B>route</B><DD><P>The <EM>route</EM> is the path that your packets take through the
network to reach their destination.
