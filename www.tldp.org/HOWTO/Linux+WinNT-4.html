<P><EM>Well, actually, it isn't a real "upgrade" of <B>running</B> NT to
2000, but a "fresh" installation of Windows 2000 Professional.
I hope it should also work for other Windows 2000 products. I
haven't tried its server-type installations yet, but I remember I 
haven't experienced any problem with NT, regarding it was Server
or Workstation.</EM></P>

<LI>First of all, a backup of important data should be made! I do it
by having another Windows-like partition on the disk, where I
copy/move my texts, drawings etc. That partition is <EM>not</EM>
going to be handled during the installation. After the backup is made, 
it's the right time to install Windows 2000.


</LI>
<LI>You see, folks, whenever I (re)install a Windows NT product, I
like to see it on a clean partition. It means, I remove i.e.
delete the existing partition where NT "system" files were stored,
in order to get free ('unused') space. Then I chose to make
a new partition that will be formatted as NTFS type of file
system. After that, I opt to install Win2000 onto the new
partition.


</LI>
<LI>The procedure of Windows 2000 Setup will remove LILO from the
MBR, so a couple of next re-bootings during the installation won't 
show LILO prompt.


</LI>
<LI>When the Win2000 installation is finished, you may re-install your
favorite applications and restore your data from the
backup. You should then check if everything goes fine with your
new and old Windoze stuff :-)


</LI>
<LI>So far - so good. Now you have to look after your Linux boot
floppy diskette. If you can't find it, you are out of luck.
Actually, I am not sure if all Linux systems might be now
activated without boot diskette. Some Linux <EM>gurus</EM>
suggest to boot Linux from the installation CD, but I don't
know if it can help in case your system doesn't have 
<EM>bootable</EM> CD-ROM drive, i.e. a modern motherboard's
BIOS. Any comment here?


</LI>
<LI>Well, after you successfully boot your Linux, you should go to
<CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> to check it once again. You should have
there at least two options: Linux and NT. Case you don't see the
option to boot your beloved Windoze, you have to add it. It
was described in previous sections. Then you have to run
<B>/sbin/lilo</B> in order to put LILO boot loader into the MBR.


</LI>
<LI>That's all. Next time you boot your computer, you'll get your
LILO prompt. Using &lt;Tab&gt; key you'll see your boot options.


</LI>
<LI>From my experience - all work great! Although I <EM>removed</EM>
previous WinNT installation in order to make new Win2000
installation and also <EM>lost</EM> (temporarily) LILO boot loader,
at the end I got both of them, Win2000 and Linux, the same
way as I did with WinNT and Linux!
