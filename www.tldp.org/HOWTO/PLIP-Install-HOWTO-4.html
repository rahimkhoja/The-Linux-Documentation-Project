<H2><A NAME="s4">4. How did I write this howto ?</A>   </H2>

<P>
<P>I wrote this paper during the installation process but since I
encountered several problems at the same time, my notes were
disparate and sometimes I forgot to write the good command lines
because I was too fed up to reboot (kernel compilations) and edit
this file each time.
<P>When the installation went wrong (it did, I'm a beginner on laptops,
plip, linux nfs, portmapper, Debian), I tried several things to fix
the problems. When they remained too long, my brain was focused on
solving, not writing.
<P>So, when the installation process finally succeeded, I decided to
restart the process from scratch by noting everything in order to
save <B>your</B> time. It was the first time I had installed Linux
twice on the same computer.
<P>Then, in order to verify the document, I again restarted from
scratch with a Slink Debian distribution (the next after the Hamm
one). It was the first time I had installed Linux 3 times on the
same computer. I hope it was the last time I have to do that.
<P>
<P><B>Conclusion</B>: If you do what is in this paper, it should
work.
