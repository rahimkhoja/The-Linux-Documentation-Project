<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This is the Sound Playing HOWTO.  It lists the many sound
formats and the applications that can be used to play them.
It also lists some hacks and advice on using these
applications.  There are also some other interesting
applications related to sound not directly related to
playback.  However, this document does <EM>not</EM> describe how
one can setup a Linux system for sound support.  Refer to the
Linux Sound HOWTO by Jeff Tranter for instructions on setting
up a Linux system for sound support and the supported sound
hardware.
<P>This deals with normal user sound applications.  That is, it
is only concerned about what the average user needs to know on
the application side of sound, not exotic stuff like speech
synthesis, or hardware stuff which is dealt in the Sound
HOWTO.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Feedback</A>
</H2>

<P>I am not omniscient, and I don't use all the applications in
here (a few I can't even try), so there are bound to be
mistakes.  Also, programs usually continuously evolve, so
documentation tends to get out of date.  Therefore, if you
find anything wrong, please send me any corrections.
Suggestions or additions to this document are welcome, too.
<P>
