>     So how do you create the your content?  First, you'll want to have 
     some introductory information.  Your first slide should contain the
     title of the presentation, your name, and who you're representing
     (if anyone).  Remember that it's good form to include the name of
     the organization that is paying for your trip, even if they're not
     who you're representing.
   </P
><P
>     Your second slide should contain the agenda for the remainder
     of the presentation.  This serves two purposes - it not only
     tells the audience what to expect, but serves as an outline
     for you as you create the slides.
   </P
><P
>     Your third (or forth, depending on how big the agenda is) should
     contain some information about you.  This sets your credibility
     with the audience as to your expertise with the subject matter.
   </P
><P
>     After that, it is up to you to start creating your slides.  However,
     here's a few hints to keep in mind as you go along:
   </P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>         Make the text of the slides big, and the amount of text
         small.  You want everyone to be able to read what is on
         the slide.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         There is no real need to write in full sentences.  You
         will want to make short points, since your talking will
         fill in the details.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         If you use backgrounds in your slides, make them of light
         colors.  Dark colors will contrast the text when they
         are printed out as handouts for attendees.
       </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>         Stick to one topic per slide.  You can have multiple slides
         per topic, just title them "Topic", "Topic (cont'd)", or number
         them.
