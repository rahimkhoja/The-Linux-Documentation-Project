>     While many Linux users will give presentations at Linux User
     Group (LUG) meetings, Expos, and other conferences, not everyone
     is effective at giving presentations.  Much like public speaking,
     a presenter needs to know how to communicate with their audience
     so that their topic is clear and understood by all.  Topics
     that may interest users can easily be lost with ineffective
     presentations.  Hopefully this document will spell out how you can
     do this properly.
