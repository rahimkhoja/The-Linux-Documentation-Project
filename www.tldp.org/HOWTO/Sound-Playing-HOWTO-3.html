<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Other useful sound utilities</A></H2>

<P>This section has nothing to do with the actual playing of
sound files.  Rather, it is a collection of some sound
utilities that one might find useful.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 volume</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a simple command line interface for controlling the
volume (what else could it be?).  It also has a separate
program with a Tcl/Tk interface included in the package for
controlling the volume and playing <CODE>.au</CODE> sound files.  A
very simple Tcl/Tk CD player is also included.
<P>This is Freeware and it is written by Sam Lantinga
(<CODE>slouken@cs.ucdavis.edu</CODE>).
<P>It can be obtained from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/soundcard/volume-2.1.tar.gz">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/soundcard/volume-2.1.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Sound Studio</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a Tcl/Tk application that supports playback,
recording, and editing of digital sound using <CODE>sox</CODE>.  It
includes <CODE>sox</CODE> in the distribution to avoid compatibility
problems.
<P>This was written by Paul Sharpe and N. J. Bailey
(<CODE>N.J.Bailey@leeds.ac.uk</CODE>).  It may be freely used and
redistributed if a postcard is sent.
<P>
<P>It can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.elec-eng.leeds.ac.uk/staff/een6njb/Software/Studio/screens.html">Sound Studio's home page</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Tickle Music</A>
</H2>

<P>This <EM>beta</EM> Tcl/Tk program is a music file browser that
allows you to play various sound formats as long as an
appropriate program to play it is on your system.  By
default <CODE>gmod</CODE> is used for playing MOD files and <CODE>mp</CODE>
for playing MIDI files (you can change the source to use
other programs).
<P>It is written and copyrighted by Shannon Hendrix
