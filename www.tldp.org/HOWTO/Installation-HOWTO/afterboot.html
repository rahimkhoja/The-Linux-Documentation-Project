including backup devices, SLIP/PPP links to an Internet Service

Associates.)  You will pick these things up as time goes by. You should

><P
>LILO is a boot loader, which can be used to select either Linux,
MS-DOS, or some other operating system at boot time.  Chances are
your distribution automatically configured LILO for you during the
installation phase (unless you're using OS/2, this is what you
should have done).  If so, you can skip the rest of this section.</P
><P
>If you installed LILO as the <EM
>primary</EM
> boot
loader, it will handle the first-stage booting process for all operating
systems on your drive. This works well if MS-DOS is the only other
operating system that you have installed. However, you might be running
OS/2, which has its own Boot Manager. In this case, you want OS/2's Boot
Manager to be the primary boot loader, and use LILO just to boot Linux (as
the <EM
>secondary</EM
> boot loader).</P
><P
>An important gotcha for people using EIDE systems: due to a BIOS
limitation, your boot sectors for any OS have to live on one of the
first two physical disks.  Otherwise LILO will hang after writing
"LI", no matter where you run it from.</P
><P
>If you have to configure LILO manually, this will involve editing the
file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>. Below we present an example of a
LILO configuration file, where the Linux root partition is on
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
>, and MS-DOS is installed on
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb1</TT
> (on the second hard drive).</P

>Now let's say that you want to use LILO as the secondary boot
loader; if you want to boot Linux from OS/2's Boot Manager, for
example.  In order to boot a Linux partition from OS/2 Boot
Manager, unfortunately, you must create the partition using OS/2's

HPFS, so that OS/2 knows about it.  (That's IBM for you.)</P

want to install LILO on your Linux root filesystem (in the above
example, <TT

should look something like:</P
