>2.1. Hardware</H2
><P
>&#13; The X server controls both input (keyboard, mouse, etc) and output (display,
 monitor) devices.

</P
><P
>&#13; Compatible hardware is a tough topic, since it is very much a moving target.
 We are forced here to avoid specifics, since this would surely change by the
 time you read this. And would be tediously lengthy anyway.

</P
><P
>&#13; So let's settle for some generalities. <EM
>Most</EM
> PC type
 hardware is supported to one degree or another. Big help ;-)

</P
><P
>&#13; Rule of thumb: if it is a device that uses a long-standing, commonplace
 protocol (e.g. PS/2), it should be well supported. Conversely, if it is
 something relatively new, with  ground-breaking technology, the odds 
 are not as good. This is just the nature of the beast with open source 
 development versus manufacturers that cater more to the most popular
 platforms. Some manufacturers are more co-operative than others too.

</P
><P
>&#13; Now, some general guidelines:

</P
><P
>&#13; <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;     Monitors - This is easy. Linux does not really need to be compatible with
     the monitor per se. That is the job of the video card. Any monitor that
     your graphics card can drive should do fine. Including, flat panel 
     monitors.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;     Video cards - This is much tougher. The X server is determined by the 
     the chipset. Many, many are supported. But inevitably there are always 
     some newer cards, or even revised cards, that are not. And some may have
     better support and better optimization than others. Advanced
     features such as multi-headed displays, 3D, TV out, DRI, etc., have some
     support as well, though this should be researched first, as the support
     may be limited. Supported cards are listed: <A
HREF="http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html</A
>.

   </P
><P
>&#13;     Open source drivers are often developed incrementally. For instance, a
     particular card may work well for basic display purposes, but specialized 
     features such as 3D may come much later in the development cycle. This
     is a quite different development model than with proprietary drivers from 
     the manufacturer.

   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Keyboards -- Any standard PC type keyboard should do fine,
    including PS/2, USB and many infra-red devices. Probably many 
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"non-standard"</SPAN
> ones too ;-)

   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;    Mice and other pointer devices -- Most should be supported including 
    PS/2, bus, serial, USB and many infra-red devices. Optical mice also. Unix
    has long preferred three button mice, though more buttons is supported as
    well. Many wheeled mice have X server support via the
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"IMPS/2"</SPAN
> (IntelliMouse), or other specific protocols, though
    may require supplemental configuration for some individual applications.
    (See the <A
HREF="appendix.html#links"

   </P

><P
>&#13;   Laptops have their own unique set of problems since the hardware tends to
   be very specialized, and often different from what is commonly found on
   desktop style systems. <SPAN

</P
><P
>&#13; Newer versions of XFree86 obviously will have better hardware support. If you
 are using an older Linux version and don't have full hardware support, see
 about upgrading XFree86. Check first to see if your distribution has updates

>&#13; The primary configuration file for XFree86 is
 <TT

>XF86Config</TT

 <TT
CLASS="filename"
>XF86Config-4</TT

 variations (see man page). It is typically located as
 <TT

 variations in the path. If both a <TT

 during installation by whatever utility your vendor uses for this purpose. 
 XFree86 also includes the <B

 but many distributions have their own such utilities. These utilities can be
 run after installation if need be, to alter the configuration, or if new
 hardware is installed. Read your locally installed documentation first. If
 you attempt to hand edit this file, be sure to make a backup copy first since

>&#13; Yours may look quite different. This is just one possible configuration with
 gratuitous comments from Red Hat (and me), and is for a fairly ordinary set
 up. There is nothing exotic here like multiple screens or displays.

>&#13; Just one quick note on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Screen"</SPAN
> section above. Notice there are
 three sub-sections, identified as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Display"</SPAN
>. Each sub-section
 has a different <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Depth"</SPAN
> specified, (a.k.a. ColorDepth). The
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Modes"</SPAN
> also vary somewhat according to the respective
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Depth"</SPAN
> setting. The active <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Display"</SPAN
> sub-section
 that will be used, is determined by the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"DefaultDepth"</SPAN
> setting 
 (unless over-ridden by command line options). The default in this example is
 defined as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"24"</SPAN
>, so the first sub-section will be used. Also,
 the highest <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Mode"</SPAN
> listed in this sub-section will be the default
 mode (resolution), which here is the first one listed. The first listed mode 
 also determines the viewable screen area, which can be smaller than the mode
 (resolution) itself. In which case, you would have a virtual desktop that is
 larger than the viewable screen. To have the viewable screen, and resolution 
 match, have the largest value as the first value listed for each
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Mode"</SPAN
>.

</P
><P
>&#13; Another note on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Modes"</SPAN
> here: what you see is the result of
 my choices during Red Hat's <B
CLASS="command"
>Xconfigurator's</B
> configuration. These 
 are standard resolutions, but do not have to be! This is only limited by what
 your hardware can support. And you don't have to use standard width x height 
 ratios either. Something like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>1355x1112</TT
> is a valid setting (if
 your hardware supports it and it floats your boat!).

</P
><P
>&#13; The X server will reject any <SPAN

 can cycle through valid modes to change screen resolution with
 <TT

> and <TT

> (that's the
 keypad plus and minus keys).

</P
