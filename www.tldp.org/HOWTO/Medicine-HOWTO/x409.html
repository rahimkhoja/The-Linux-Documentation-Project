>8.3. My Assumptions About You</H2
><P
>I will try to be pretty cook book about how to install these applications, which means that if I can, i will always tell you what to type (at least what to type that works for me).  The problem is that this assumes that you know what a shell window is and can switch directories with-in, which actually assumes a fair level of technical sophistication since most of us have gotten used to Microsoft based Windows systems. Which is to say that a lot of us only have interacted with a computer using a Graphics User Interface (Gui's), and that these installation require that you be familiar with Command Line Interfaces (CLI) like a terminal window or a shell.
	</P
><P
>If you don't know what I am talking about then I recommend you ask someone (me possibly) about what shell windows are, and probably what a UNIX-based Operating system looks like, especially without a GUI.

>8.4.1. What is it?</H3
><P
>			The OIO system starts a higher level of abstraction
			- starting with modeling "forms". The forms are then
			used to model/build progress notes etc. The OIO system
			makes use of a relational database back-end (PostgreSQL) - 1) making the data/metadata/presentation separation more distinct, 2) making integration with other system (e.g. legacy systems, GNUMed, SQL Clinic etc) easier, 3) making query construction/extension easier (via SQL).
			</P
><P
>If you search the OpenHealth mailing list archives, you will see extensive discussion regarding this in the context of GEHR and OIO. GEHR uses the same approach but calls this intermediate level of abstraction "archetypes".  The advantage of the OIO/GEHR approach is that the metadata components can be plug-and-play - meaning that the system can be easily extended/customized AND portable medical records become easier to implement.

><P
>One of the more aggravating things was find that Zope could not interact (connect) to the PostgreSQL database.  What was happening (I will give greater detail later) is that the 'postgres' user could not be authenticated. I think this is a problem in that Krebs authentication is not installed by default.  To fix this you need to <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>cd /etc/PostgreSQL/</B

> and find the pg_hba.conf file.  Using what ever editor you like, find the bit of code that tells who can and can not access to the database.  Unfortunately, the only way I could get it to work for now is to change:</P
