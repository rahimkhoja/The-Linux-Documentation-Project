>Debian-Med is a Debian meta-project allows for installation of medical themed appliations.  Debian-Med is not a separate distribution, but is an extended functionality for Debian users.  Below you will see many applications for the medical community.  Typically, you would download and install a single application, and resolve any issues that arise during an installation.  Debian-Med solves that installation issue.  The Debian-Med project leaders will note that an application is a medical or biosciences related application. </P
><P
>After you have installed Debian, you can choose to load either a single application, or you can choose to load Debian-Med.  Loading Debian-Med will install all of the applications that have been designated as medical or biosciences related.  The Debian-Med project can be found in the Apt-get repositories.  <A

><P
>OpenEMR is a modular, HIPAA compliant, open source, practice management, electronic medical record and prescription writing application.  OpenEMR should have billing capability using FreeB by late April 2004.  The planned billing functionality for OpenEMR will include the ability to generate ANSI X12 or HCFA 1500 forms, or submit bills directly to Medicaid, Medicare or private insurers.   The developers on the project are actively working on completing the billing functionality.  2.5.2 is the latest version of OpenEMR and includes the ability to find the first available appointment on the calendar for a provider, direct links to encounters from the calendar, different calendar views for a provider or office staff, reporting using phpMyAdmin and prescription writing.</P
><P
>OpenEMR uses Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.  OpenEMR incorporates the work of several open source projects such as PostCalendar from PostNuke for calendaring, and phpMyAdmin for database reporting and manipulation.  OpenEMR is also integrating the work of FreeB for billing.</P

VISTA is an open source application that is funded by the federal government for use by the Veterans Administration at its hospitals and clinics.  I used this system, when I was a resident, in the VA hospital, and it was the best system that I had used.  This is a wonderful project that I can recommend.  I am not sure about the software license, but the software and documentation are available from the U.S. Federal Government.  To obtain the software you must file a Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") request.  The current fees to obtain VISTA on CD are $53US for the main VISTA packages and $13 for imageing.  <A

>WorldVista and OpenVista</A
> are open source variants of VISTA.</P
><P
>WorldVista helps make healthcare information technology more affordable and more widely available both within the United States and internationally. WorldVistA extends and improves VistA for use outside its original setting through such activities as developing packages for pediatrics, obstetrics, and other hospital services not used in veterans' hospitals. WorldVistA also helps those who choose to adopt VistA successfully master, install, and maintain the software. As the group of VistA adopters and programmers grows, we work to develop it into a collaborative, consensus-based, open-source community.
		</P
><P
> The OpenVistA project will help its adopters eliminate these fees by allowing VistA to run on the GT.M programming environment and the Linux operating system, both of which are open source and free.  Historically, VISTA required adopters to pay licensing fees for the systems on which it runs: the programming environment (MUMPS) and the operating system underneath (such as Microsoft Windows or VMS).  By reducing licensing costs, OpenVistA frees up money to be spent on medicine, medical professionals, and other resources more likely to directly improve patient care. Like all WorldVistA projects, the OpenVistA project not only provides adopters with the software itself but also transfers knowledge and expertise and builds long-term mutual support relationships between adopters and the rest of the worldwide VistA community.  This software is for medical clinics, FQHC, hospitals, medicine training facilities, and community medical clinics.</P

>					SQL Clinic is designed to be reverse engineered and used for medical or other purposes.  SQL CLinic is based on Lincoln Stein's CGI.pm module and the incredible horsepower of PostgreSQL.  The developer's goal for SQL Clinic is for the project to have utility as an example of how to access postgres via Perl than as a mere clinical application.

				</P
><P
>FreeMED is working on two functional additions:  billing with FreeB and reporting using Agata.  FreeB will allow FreeMED users to send ANSI X12 or HCFA 1500 forms directly to a payer.

It can integrate almost any type of services, systems, departments, clinics, processes, data, or communication that exist in a hospital. Care2x's design can even handle non-medical services or functions like security or maintenance. All of its functions can be accessed with a Web browser, and all program modules are processed on the server side.

It provides an enterprise-quality platform for aggregating XML-based patient medical records, in both clinical and research applications. It is middleware, situated between clients and traditional Health Information Systems (HIS), Radiology Information Systems (RIS), and Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS). It supports relational (SQL), SOAP, and HTTP data sources out of the box, but is highly extensible for custom types. A suite of Web-based tools allows for the centralized management of distributed data sources, and the rapid deployment of new services. It addresses HIPAA concerns with query auditing, tight integration with security mechanisms, and patient record de-identification.
