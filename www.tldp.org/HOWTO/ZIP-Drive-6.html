<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Using the ZIP drive</A></H2>

<P>If you have built in all the required components, the kernel should
recognize your adapter and drive at boot time.  If you are using a
loadable module for your driver, the following discussion applies once
that module is loaded.
<P>For the most part, the SCSI and parallel versions of the drive behave
identically, except that the parallel version is somewhat slower.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Fdisk, mke2fs, mount, etc.</A>
</H2>

<P>Once you know the drive name for your ZIP drive, you are set.  You can
manipulate the drive with the normal Linux disk management commands.
<CODE>fdisk</CODE> (or perhaps <CODE>cfdisk</CODE>) is used to manipulate the partition tables
on the disk.  <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> can be used to format a partition with the ext2
filesystem - the one most commonly used in Linux.  <CODE>mount</CODE> is used to
connect a formatted partition into your directory hierarchy.
<P>You should study the manual pages for these tools if you are not
familiar with them.  Be warned that there are now several quite
different versions of the <CODE>fdisk</CODE> program - be careful.
<P>I'll describe two common scenarios.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 An existing DOS formatted disk</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have a ZIP disk with a DOS file structure that was originally
created by Iomega's tools, the partition scan should say that the disk
has one partition, <CODE>/dev/sda4</CODE>.
<P>You should make a place to mount the disk, lets say <CODE>/zip</CODE>, and then
mount it as an MS-DOS filesystem:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       mkdir /zip
       mount -t vfat /dev/sda4 /zip
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You could also use msdos instead of vfat. vfat supports long filenames
where msdos does not.
Now, the files on the disk should appear in /zip.  While the disk is
mounted, you will not be able to remove it.  When you are finished
with the disk you can umount it to release it and detach it from your
directory hierarchy.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       umount /zip
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once you've made the /zip mount point - you don't need to do it again,
so you could come back later and mount something else there.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Re-format as a native Linux disk</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you want to erase a ZIP disk and make a Linux native file system on
it.  You should use fdisk on the entire disk:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       fdisk /dev/sda
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and delete any existing partitions (with the <CODE>d</CODE> command).  Then create
a new partition with the <CODE>n</CODE> command, make it primary partition number
1, use <CODE>w</CODE> to write the partition table to disk, and quit with
<CODE>q</CODE>.
<P>Format the partition
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       mke2fs /dev/sda1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(The 1 is the number that you gave this partition in <CODE>fdisk</CODE>).  Now you
can mount the disk:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /zip
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(re-using that mount point we created before).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 fstab entries</A>
</H2>

<P>The /etc/fstab allows you to configure the mount command. I like to 
be able to mount and write to the zip disk from any login id on the 
system. I added 2 lines to the end of the fstab file that look like this.
<P>
<PRE>
   /dev/sda1    /zip            ext2            noauto,rw,user,nosuid,sync
   /dev/sda4    /zipdos         vfat            noauto,rw,user,nosuid,sync,mode=0777
   
</PRE>
<P>These entries assume that you have a /zip and a /zipdos directory. If
you want all users ids to read and write, make sure you set the permissions.
For exmaple <B> chmod 666 /zip </B>. You must do the chmod as root.
The fstab entries also assume that your dos disks are partitioned as 4
(sda4 in my case), and the ext2(linux) disks are partitoned as 1 (sda1).
You can read more about the fstab options with <B>man mount</B>
<P>With the fstab entries as above you can mount a dos disk with 
<B> mount /zipdos </B>
If you are using a linux ext2 disk then use the command
<B> mount /zip </B>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 The ZIP Tools disk</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There is some extra work to be done if you want to use the disk that
comes with the ZIP drive.  As shipped, the software controlled write
protection is enabled.  Most people have unlocked the disk under DOS
before ever trying to use it with Linux.  Linux cannot access a locked
disk, and it must be unlocked with Iomega's tools.
<P>A native Linux program to manage the write protection feature, among
other things, is expected to be available soon.
