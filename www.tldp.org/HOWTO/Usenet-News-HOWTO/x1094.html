persistent locks. There are instances when the scripts have created locks files

analysis. They could be an indication of some part of the system not working
correctly. For <EM

As the articles are digested in huge numbers, the <TT

area continues to grow. Also, you will need space if you have chosen to archive
articles on expiry.  Allocate a few GB of disk space for
<TT

subscribing and the feeds that come in everyday. <TT

NAME="AEN1164">10.4. CPU load and RAM usage</H2
><P
>With modern C-News and NNTPd, there is very little usage of these
system resources for processing news article flow. Key components like
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newsrun</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sendbatches</TT
> do not load
the system much, except for cases where you have a very heavy flow of
compressed outgoing batches and the compression utility is run by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sendbatches</TT
> frequently. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newsrun</TT
> is
amazingly efficient in the current C-News release. Even when it takes
half an hour to digest a large consignment of batches, it hardly loads the
CPU of a slow Pentium 200 MHz CPU or consumes much RAM in a 64 MB
system.</P
><P
>One thing which does slow down a system is a large bunch of
users connecting using NNTP to browse newsgroups. We do not have
heuristic based figures off-hand to provide a guidance figure for
resource consumption for this, but we have found that the load on the
CPU and RAM for a certain number of active users invoking
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> is more than with an equal number of
users connecting to the POP3 port of the same system for pulling
out mailboxes. A few hundred active NNTP users can really slow down
a dual-P-III Intel Linux server, for instance. This loading has no
bearing on whether you are using INN or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
>;
both have practically identical implementations for NNTP
<EM
>reading</EM
> and differ only in their handling of
feeds.</P
><P
>Another situation which will slow down your Usenet news server is
when downstream servers connect to you for pulling out NNTP feeds using
the pull method. This has been mentioned before. This can really load
your server's I/O system and CPU.</P

that feeds are coming in. The batches and articles have different nomenclature.
