done correctly, a lot of problems can be caused in the functioning of
the C-News system later.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> is fired each time a new NNTP connection
is received, and dies once the NNTP client closes its connection. Thus,
if one <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> receives a few articles by an incoming
batch feed (not a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="LITERAL"

then another <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT

these articles till the batches are digested. This will hamper
duplicate newsfeed detection if there are multiple upstream NDNs feeding
our server with the same set of articles over NNTP. To fix this,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>msgidd</TT
>, the
message ID daemon. This
daemon is fired once at server bootup time through
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newsboot</TT
>, and keeps running quietly in the
background, listening on a named Unix socket in the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$NEWSCTL</TT

message IDs which various incarnations of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT

asked it to remember.</P
><P
>Thus, when one copy of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> receives an
incoming feed of news articles, it updates <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msgidd</TT
>
with the message IDs of these messages through the Unix socket. When
another copy of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> is fired later and the NNTP
client tries to feed it some more articles, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
>
checks each message ID against <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msgidd</TT
>. Since
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msgidd</TT
> stores all these IDs in memory, the lookup is
very fast, and duplicate articles are blocked at the NNTP interface
itself.</P
><P
>On a running system, expect to see one instance of
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> for each active NNTP connection, and just one
instance of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msgidd</TT
> running quietly in the background,
hardly consuming any CPU resources. Our <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> is
configured to die if the NNTP connection is more than a few minutes
idle, thus conserving server resources. This does not inconvenience the
user because modern NNTP clients simply re-connect. If an
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>nntpd</TT
> instance is found to be running for days, it is
either hung due to a network error, or is receiving a very long incoming
NNTP feed from your upstream server. We used to receive our primary
incoming feed from our service provider through NNTP sessions lasting 18

>NOV, the News Overview System is a recent augmentation to the
C-News and NNTP systems and to the NNTP protocol. This subsystem
maintains a file for each active newsgroup, in which it maintains one
line per current article. This line of text contains some key meta-data
about the article, <EM

up NNTP response enormously. The <TT

integrated into the <TT

of C-News, thus providing seamless maintenance of the News Overview
