><P
></P
><P
>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other</P
><P
>functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to</P
><P
>assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,</P
><P
>with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.</P
><P
>Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way</P
><P
>to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible</P
><P
>for modifications made by others.</P
><P
></P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative</P
><P
>works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It</P
><P
>complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft</P
><P
>license designed for free software.</P
><P
></P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free</P
><P
>software, because free software needs free documentation: a free</P
><P
>program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the</P
><P
>software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;</P
><P
>it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or</P
><P
>whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License</P
><P
>principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</P
><P
></P
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that</P
><P
>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be</P
><P
>distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a</P
><P
>world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that</P
><P
>work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,</P
><P
>refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a</P
><P
>licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you</P
><P
>copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission</P
><P
>under copyright law.</P
><P
></P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the</P
><P
>Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with</P
><P
>modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
></P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of</P
><P
>the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the</P
><P
>publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject</P
><P
>(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly</P
><P
>within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a</P
><P
>textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any</P
><P
>mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical</P
><P
>connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,</P
><P
>commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding</P
><P
>them.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles</P
><P
>are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice</P
><P
>that says that the Document is released under this License. If a</P
><P
>section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not</P
><P
>allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero</P
><P
>Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant</P
><P
>Sections then there are none.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,</P
><P
>as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that</P
><P
>the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may</P
><P
>be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</P
><P
></P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,</P
><P
>represented in a format whose specification is available to the</P
><P
>general public, that is suitable for revising the document</P
><P
>straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of</P
><P
>pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available</P
><P
>drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or</P
><P
>for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input</P
><P
>to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file</P
><P
>format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart</P
><P
>or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.</P
><P
>An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount</P
><P
>of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
></P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain</P
><P
>ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML</P
><P
>or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple</P
><P
>HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of</P
><P
>transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats</P
><P
>include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by</P
><P
>proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or</P
><P
>processing tools are not generally available, and the</P
><P
>machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word</P
><P
>processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,</P
><P
>plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material</P
><P
>this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in</P
><P
>formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means</P
><P
>the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,</P
><P
>preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</P
><P
></P
><P
>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose</P
><P
>title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following</P
><P
>text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a</P
><P
>specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",</P
><P
>"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"</P
><P
>of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a</P
><P
>section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which</P
><P
>states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty</P
><P
>Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this</P
><P
>License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other</P
><P
>implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has</P
><P
>no effect on the meaning of this License.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>2. VERBATIM COPYING</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either</P
><P
>commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the</P
><P
>copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies</P
><P
>to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other</P
><P
>conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use</P
><P
>technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further</P
><P
>copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept</P
><P
>compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough</P
><P
>number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and</P
><P
>you may publicly display copies.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have</P
><P
>printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the</P
><P
>Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the</P
><P
>copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover</P
><P
>Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on</P
><P
>the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify</P
><P
>you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present</P
><P
>the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and</P
><P
>visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.</P
><P
>Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve</P
><P
>the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated</P
><P
>as verbatim copying in other respects.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit</P
><P
>legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit</P
><P
>reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent</P
><P
>pages.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering</P
><P
>more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent</P
><P
>copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy</P
><P
>a computer-network location from which the general network-using</P
><P
>public has access to download using public-standard network protocols</P
><P
>a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.</P
><P
>If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,</P
><P
>when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure</P
><P
>that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated</P
><P
>location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an</P
><P
>Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that</P
><P
>edition to the public.</P
><P
></P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the</P
><P
>Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give</P
><P
>them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>4. MODIFICATIONS</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under</P
><P
>the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release</P
><P
>the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified</P
><P
>Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution</P
><P
>and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy</P
><P
>of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P
><P
></P
><P
>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct</P
><P
>from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions</P
><P
>(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section</P
><P
>of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version</P
><P
>if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</P
><P
>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities</P
><P
>responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified</P
><P
>Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the</P
><P
>Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),</P
><P
>unless they release you from this requirement.</P
><P
>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the</P
><P
>Modified Version, as the publisher.</P
><P
>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</P
><P
>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications</P
><P
>adjacent to the other copyright notices.</P
><P
>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice</P
><P
>giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the</P
><P
>terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</P
><P
>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections</P
><P
>and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</P
><P
>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</P
><P
>I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add</P
><P
>to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and</P
><P
>publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If</P
><P
>there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one</P
><P
>stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as</P
><P
>given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified</P
><P
>Version as stated in the previous sentence.</P
><P
>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for</P
><P
>public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise</P
><P
>the network locations given in the Document for previous versions</P
><P
>it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.</P
><P
>You may omit a network location for a work that was published at</P
><P
>least four years before the Document itself, or if the original</P
><P
>publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</P
><P
>K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",</P
><P
>Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all</P
><P
>the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements</P
><P
>and/or dedications given therein.</P
><P
>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,</P
><P
>unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers</P
><P
>or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</P
><P
>M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section</P
><P
>may not be included in the Modified Version.</P
><P
>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"</P
><P
>or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</P
><P
>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or</P
><P
>appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material</P
><P
>copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all</P
><P
>of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the</P
><P
>list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.</P
><P
>These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains</P
><P
>nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various</P
><P
>parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has</P
><P
>been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a</P
><P
>standard.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a</P
><P
>passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list</P
><P
>of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of</P
><P
>Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or</P
><P
>through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already</P
><P
>includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or</P
><P
>by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,</P
><P
>you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit</P
><P
>permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License</P
><P
>give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or</P
><P
>imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this</P
><P
>License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified</P
><P
>versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the</P
><P
>Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and</P
><P
>list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its</P
><P
>license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</P
><P
></P
><P
>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and</P
><P
>multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single</P
><P
>copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but</P
><P
>different contents, make the title of each such section unique by</P
><P
>adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original</P
><P
>author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.</P
><P
>Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of</P
><P
>Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</P
><P
></P
><P
>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"</P
><P
>in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled</P
><P
>"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",</P
><P
>and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections</P
><P
>Entitled "Endorsements".</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents</P
><P
>released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this</P
><P
>License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in</P
><P
>the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for</P
><P
>verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute</P
><P
>it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this</P
><P
>License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all</P
><P
>other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</P
><P
></P
><P
>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate</P
><P
>and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or</P
><P
>distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright</P
><P
>resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights</P
><P
>of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.</P
><P
>When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not</P
><P
>apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves</P
><P
>derivative works of the Document.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these</P
><P
>copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of</P
><P
>the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on</P
><P
>covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the</P
><P
>electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.</P
><P
>Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole</P
><P
>aggregate.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>8. TRANSLATION</P
><P
></P
><P
>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may</P
><P
>distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.</P
><P
>Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special</P
><P
>permission from their copyright holders, but you may include</P
><P
>translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the</P
><P
>original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a</P
><P
>translation of this License, and all the license notices in the</P
><P
>Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include</P
><P
>the original English version of this License and the original versions</P
><P
>of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between</P
><P
>the translation and the original version of this License or a notice</P
><P
>or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",</P
><P
>"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve</P
><P
>its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual</P
><P
>title.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>9. TERMINATION</P
><P
></P
><P
>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except</P
><P
>as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to</P
><P
>copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will</P
><P
>automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,</P
><P
>parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this</P
><P
>License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</P
><P
>parties remain in full compliance.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</P
><P
></P
><P
>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions</P
><P
>of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new</P
><P
>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</P
><P
>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See</P
><P
>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</P
><P
></P
><P
>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.</P
><P
>If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this</P
><P
>License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of</P
><P
>following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or</P
><P
>of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the</P
><P
>Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version</P
><P
>number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not</P
><P
>as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</P
><P
></P
><P
></P
><P
>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</P
><P
></P
><P
>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of</P
><P
>the License in the document and put the following copyright and</P
><P
>license notices just after the title page:</P
><P
></P
><P
>Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.</P
><P
>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document</P
><P
>under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2</P
><P
>or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;</P
><P
>with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.</P
><P
>A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU</P
><P
>Free Documentation License".</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,</P
><P
>replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</P
><P
></P
><P
>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the</P
><P
>Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other</P
><P
>combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the</P
><P
>situation.</P
><P
></P
><P
>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we</P
><P
>recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of</P
><P
>free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,</P
><P
>to permit their use in free software.</P
