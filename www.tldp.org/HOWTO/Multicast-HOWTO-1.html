<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction. </A></H2>

<P>I'll try to give here the most wide range, up to date and accurate 
information related to multicasting over TCP/IP networks that I can. Any 
feedback is very welcome. If you find any
mistakes in this document, have any comments about its contents or an update or
addition, please send them to me at the address listed at the top of this howto.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is Multicast.</A>
</H2>

<P>Multicast is... a need. Well, at least in some scenarios. If you
have information (a <EM>lot</EM> of information, usually) that should be
transmitted to various (but usually not <EM>all</EM>) hosts over an internet, 
then Multicast is the answer. One common situation in which 
it is used is when distributing real time audio and video to the 
set of hosts which have joined a distributed conference.
<P>Multicast is much like radio or TV in the sense that only those who
have tuned their receivers (by selecting a particular frequency
they are interested on) receive the information. That is:
you hear the channel you are interested in, but not the others.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 The problem with Unicast.</A>
</H2>

<P>Unicast is anything that is not broadcast nor multicast. All right, 
the definition
is not very bright... When you send a packet and there is only one
sender process -yours- and one recipient process (the <EM>one</EM> you are
sending the packet to), then this is unicast. TCP is, by its own nature,
unicast oriented. UDP supports a lot more paradigms, but if you are
sending UDP packets and there is only one precess supposed to receive
them, this is unicast too.
<P>For years unicast transmissions proved to be enough for the Internet.
It was not until 1993 when the first implementation of multicast saw
the light in the 4.4 BSD release. It seems nobody needed it until
then. Which were those new problems that multicast addressed? 
<P>Needless to say that the Internet has changed a lot since the "early
days". Particularly, the appearance of the Web strongly transformed
the situation: people didn't just want connections to remote hosts,
mail and FTP. First they wanted to see the pictures people placed in
their home pages, but later they also wanted to <EM>see</EM> and <EM>hear</EM> 
that people.
<P>With today's technology it is possible to afford the "cost" of making
a unicast connection with everyone who wants to see your web page.
However, if you are to send audio and video, which needs a <EM>huge</EM>
amount of bandwidth compared with web applications, you have -you <EM>had</EM>,
until multicast came into scene- two options: to establish a separate
unicast connection with <EM>each</EM> of the recipients, or to use broadcast.
The first solution is not affordable: if we said that a <EM>single</EM>
connection sending audio/video consumes a huge bandwidth, imagine 
having to establish hundreds or, may be, thousands of those connections.
Both the sending computer and your network would collapse.
<P>Broadcast seems to be <EM>a</EM> solution, but it's not certainly <EM>the</EM> solution. 
If you want all the hosts in your LAN to attend the conference, you
may use broadcast. Packets will be sent only once and every host will 
receive them as they are sent to the broadcast address. The problem
is that perhaps only a <EM>few</EM> of the hosts and not <EM>all</EM> are interested 
in those packets. Furthermore: perhaps some hosts are really interested 
in your conference, but they are outside of your LAN, a few routers away. 
And you know that broadcast works fine inside a LAN, but problems arise 
when you want broadcast packets to be routed across different LANs.
<P>The best solution seems to be one in which you send packets to a certain
special address (a certain frequency in radio/TV transmissions). Then,
all hosts which have decided to join the conference will be aware of
packets with that destination address, read them when they traverse
the network, and pass them to the IP layer to be demultiplexed. This is
similar to broadcasting in that you send only one broadcast packet and
all the hosts in the network recognize and read it; it differs, however, 
in that not all multicast packets are read and processed, but only those
that were previously registered in the kernel as being "of interest".
<P>Those special packets are routed at kernel level like any packet because
they <EM>are</EM> IP packets. The only difference might reside in the routing 
algorithm which tells the kernel where to route or not to route them.
