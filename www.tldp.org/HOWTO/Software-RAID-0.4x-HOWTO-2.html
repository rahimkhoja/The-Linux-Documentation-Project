<LI><B>Q</B>:
What is RAID?  Why would I ever use it?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
RAID is a way of combining multiple disk drives into a single
entity to improve performance and/or reliability.  There are
a variety of different types and implementations of RAID, each 
with its own advantages and disadvantages.  For example, by
putting a copy of the same data on two disks (called 
<B>disk mirroring</B>, or RAID level 1), read performance can be
improved by reading alternately from each disk in the mirror.
On average, each disk is less busy, as it is handling only 
1/2 the reads (for two disks), or 1/3 (for three disks), etc.
In addition, a mirror can improve reliability: if one disk
fails, the other disk(s) have a copy of the data.  Different
ways of combining the disks into one, referred to as 
<B>RAID levels</B>,  can provide greater storage efficiency
than simple mirroring, or can alter latency (access-time) 
performance, or throughput (transfer rate) performance, for
reading or writing, while still retaining redundancy that
is useful for guarding against failures.
<P><B>Although RAID can protect against disk failure, it does 
not protect against operator and administrator (human) 
error, or against loss due to programming bugs (possibly 
due to bugs in the RAID software itself).  The net abounds with
tragic tales of system administrators who have bungled a RAID
installation, and have lost all of their data.  RAID is not a
substitute for frequent, regularly scheduled backup.</B>
<P>RAID can be implemented 
in hardware, in the form of special disk controllers, or in
software, as a kernel module that is layered in between the 
low-level disk driver, and the file system which sits above it.
RAID hardware is always a "disk controller", that is, a device 
to which one can cable up the disk drives. Usually it comes 
in the form of an adapter card that will plug into a 
ISA/EISA/PCI/S-Bus/MicroChannel slot.  However, some RAID
controllers are in the form of a box that connects into
the cable in between the usual system disk controller, and 
the disk drives.  Small ones may fit into a drive bay; large
ones may be built into a storage cabinet with its own drive 
bays and power supply.  The latest RAID hardware used with
the latest &amp; fastest CPU will usually provide the best overall
performance, although at a significant price.  This is because 
most RAID controllers come with on-board DSP's and memory
cache that can off-load a considerable amount of processing 
from the main CPU, as well as allow high transfer rates into 
the large controller cache.  Old RAID hardware can act as 
a "de-accelerator" when used with newer CPU's: yesterday's
fancy DSP and cache can act as a bottleneck, and it's
performance is often beaten by pure-software RAID and new
but otherwise plain, run-of-the-mill disk controllers.  
RAID hardware can offer an advantage over pure-software
RAID, if it can makes use of disk-spindle synchronization
and its knowledge of the disk-platter position with 
regard to the disk head, and the desired disk-block.
However, most modern (low-cost) disk drives do not offer 
this information and level of control anyway, and thus,
most RAID hardware does not take advantage of it.
RAID hardware is usually
not compatible across different brands, makes and models:
if a RAID controller fails, it must be replaced by another
controller of the same type.  As of this writing (June 1998),
a broad variety of hardware controllers will operate under Linux;
however, none of them currently come with configuration
and management utilities that run under Linux.
<P>Software-RAID is a set of kernel modules, together with 
management utilities that implement RAID purely in software,
and require no extraordinary hardware.  The Linux RAID subsystem
is implemented as a layer in the kernel that sits above the
low-level disk drivers (for IDE, SCSI and Paraport drives),
and the block-device interface.  The filesystem, be it ext2fs,
DOS-FAT, or other, sits above the block-device interface.
Software-RAID, by its very software nature, tends to be more
flexible than a hardware solution.  The downside is that it
of course requires more CPU cycles and power to run well
than a comparable hardware system.  Of course, the cost
can't be beat.  Software RAID has one further important 
distinguishing feature: it operates on a partition-by-partition
basis, where a number of individual disk partitions are
ganged together to create a RAID partition.  This is in 
contrast to most hardware RAID solutions, which gang together
entire disk drives into an array.  With hardware, the fact that
there is a RAID array is transparent to the operating system,
which tends to simplify management.  With software, there
are far more configuration options and choices, tending to 
complicate matters.
<P><B>As of this writing (June 1998), the administration of RAID 
under Linux is far from trivial, and is best attempted by
experienced system administrators.  The theory of operation
is complex.  The system tools require modification to startup
scripts.  And recovery from disk failure is non-trivial, 
and prone to human error.   RAID is not for the novice,
and any benefits it may bring to reliability and performance
can be easily outweighed by the extra complexity.  Indeed,
modern disk drives are incredibly reliable and modern 
CPU's and controllers are quite powerful.  You might more
easily obtain the desired reliability and performance levels
by purchasing higher-quality and/or faster hardware.</B>

<LI><B>Q</B>:
What are RAID levels?  Why so many? What distinguishes them?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
The different RAID levels have different performance, 
redundancy, storage capacity, reliability and cost 
characteristics.   Most, but not all levels of RAID
offer redundancy against disk failure.  Of those that
offer redundancy, RAID-1 and RAID-5 are the most popular.
RAID-1 offers better performance, while RAID-5 provides 
for more efficient use of the available storage space.
However, tuning for performance is an entirely different 
matter, as performance depends strongly on a large variety
of factors, from the type of application, to the sizes of
stripes, blocks, and files.  The more difficult aspects of
performance tuning are deferred to a later section of this HOWTO.
<P>The following describes the different RAID levels in the 
context of the Linux software RAID implementation.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>RAID-linear</B>
is a simple concatenation of partitions to create
a larger virtual partition.  It is handy if you have a number 
small drives, and wish to create a single, large partition.
This concatenation offers no redundancy, and in fact
decreases the overall reliability: if any one disk 
fails, the combined partition will fail.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>RAID-1</B> is also referred to as "mirroring".
Two (or more) partitions, all of the same size, each store 
an exact copy of all data, disk-block by disk-block.
Mirroring gives strong protection against disk failure:
if one disk fails, there is another with the an exact copy
of the same data. Mirroring can also help improve
performance in I/O-laden systems, as read requests can
be divided up between several disks.   Unfortunately,
mirroring is also the least efficient in terms of storage: 
two mirrored partitions can store no more data than a 
single partition.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Striping</B> is the underlying concept behind all of
the other RAID levels.  A stripe is a contiguous sequence 
of disk blocks.  A stripe may be as short as a single disk
block, or may consist of thousands.  The RAID drivers 
split up their component disk partitions into stripes;
the different RAID levels differ in how they organize the
stripes, and what data they put in them. The interplay
between the size of the stripes, the typical size of files
in the file system, and their location on the disk is what
determines the overall performance of the RAID subsystem.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>RAID-0</B> is much like RAID-linear, except that
the component partitions are divided into stripes and 
then interleaved.  Like RAID-linear, the result is a single
larger virtual partition.  Also like RAID-linear, it offers
no redundancy, and therefore decreases overall reliability:
a single disk failure will knock out the whole thing.
RAID-0 is often claimed to improve performance over the
simpler RAID-linear.  However, this may or may not be true,
depending on the characteristics to the file system, the
typical size of the file as compared to the size of the
stripe, and the type of workload.  The <CODE>ext2fs</CODE> 
file system already scatters files throughout a partition,
in an effort to minimize fragmentation. Thus, at the
simplest level, any given access may go to one of several
disks, and thus, the interleaving of stripes across multiple
disks offers no apparent additional advantage. However,
there are performance differences, and they are data,
workload, and stripe-size dependent.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>RAID-4</B> interleaves stripes like RAID-0, but
it requires an additional partition to store parity
information.  The parity is used to offer redundancy:
if any one of the disks fail, the data on the remaining disks
can be used to reconstruct the data that was on the failed 
disk.  Given N data disks, and one parity disk, the 
parity stripe is computed by taking one stripe from each
of the data disks, and XOR'ing them together.  Thus,
the storage capacity of a an (N+1)-disk RAID-4 array
is N, which is a lot better than mirroring (N+1) drives,
and is almost as good as a RAID-0 setup for large N.
Note that for N=1, where there is one data drive, and one
parity drive, RAID-4 is a lot like mirroring, in that
each of the two disks is a copy of each other.  However,
RAID-4 does <B>NOT</B> offer the read-performance
of mirroring, and offers considerably degraded write
performance. In brief, this is because updating the 
parity requires a read of the old parity, before the new
parity can be calculated and written out.  In an
environment with lots of writes, the parity disk can become
a bottleneck, as each write must access the parity disk.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>RAID-5</B> avoids the write-bottleneck of RAID-4
by alternately storing the parity stripe on each of the
drives.  However, write performance is still not as good
as for mirroring, as the parity stripe must still be read
and XOR'ed before it is written.  Read performance is 
also not as good as it is for mirroring, as, after all,
there is only one copy of the data, not two or more.
RAID-5's principle advantage over mirroring is that it
offers redundancy and protection against single-drive
failure, while offering far more storage capacity  when
used with three or more drives.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>RAID-2 and RAID-3</B> are seldom used anymore, and
to some degree are have been made obsolete by modern disk
technology.  RAID-2 is similar to RAID-4, but stores 
ECC information instead of parity.  Since all modern disk
drives incorporate ECC under the covers, this offers 
little additional protection.  RAID-2 can offer greater
data consistency if power is lost during a write; however,
battery backup and a clean shutdown can offer the same
benefits.  RAID-3 is similar to RAID-4, except that it
uses the smallest possible stripe size. As a result, any 
given read will involve all disks, making overlapping 
I/O requests difficult/impossible. In order to avoid
delay due to rotational latency, RAID-3 requires that 
all disk drive spindles be synchronized. Most modern
disk drives lack spindle-synchronization ability, or,
if capable of it, lack the needed connectors, cables,
and manufacturer documentation.  Neither RAID-2 nor RAID-3 
are supported by the Linux Software-RAID drivers.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Other RAID levels</B> have been defined by various
researchers and vendors.  Many of these represent the
layering of one type of raid on top of another.  Some
require special hardware, and others are protected by 
patent. There is no commonly accepted naming scheme
for these other levels. Sometime the advantages of these 
other systems are minor, or at least not apparent 
until the system is highly stressed.  Except for the
layering of RAID-1 over RAID-0/linear, Linux Software
RAID does not support any of the other variations.
