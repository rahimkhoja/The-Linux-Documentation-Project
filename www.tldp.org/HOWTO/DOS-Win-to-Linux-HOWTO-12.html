<P>
<P>Congratulations! You have now grasped a little bit of UNIX and are ready to
start working. Remember that your knowledge of the system is still limited,
and that you are expected to do more practice with Linux to use it
comfortably. But if all you had to do was get a bunch of applications and
start working with them, what I included here is enough.
<P>I'm sure you'll enjoy using Linux and will keep learning more about
it---everybody does. I bet, too, that you'll never go back to DOS/Win! I
hope I made myself understood and did a good service to my 3 or 4 readers.
<P>
