<P>When I began the creation of a new front end the only 
source of information was an article 'Writing a Compiler
Front End' from 'Using Maintaining and Enhancing Cobol for the 
GNU Compiler Collection' by Tim Josling.
<P>Details regarding GCC can be obtained from the home page 
of GCC.
Information was also obtained from the GCC manual that is 
available with each distribution of GCC.
<P>But the vital source of information is the front ends of
other languages. But I'll never recommend them for the beginner.
Once you are on  track then they will be of great help to 
you.
