>I've been maintaining this document for nearly six years (I believe
the first submitted version was January 1998).  I've received a lot of
e-mail, almost all of it positive with a lot of great suggestions, and I've
had a really good time doing this.  Thanks to everyone for the support,
suggestions, and translations!&#13;</P

>I've had several requests both from individuals and the LDP group to issue
a new version of this document, and it's long past due (two and a half years 
since the last version) - for which I apologize.  Converting this monster
to DocBook format was a daunting task, and then when I realized that I
could now include images, I decided I needed to include all the cool
examples that currently reside on my homepage.  Adding these is a slow
process, especially since I'm improving the code as I go, so only a few are
included so far.  This document will probably always feel incomplete to me
...  I think however that it's reasonably sound from a technical point of
view (although I have some mailed in fixes that aren't in here yet
- if you've heard from me, they'll get in here eventually) so I'm going to
post it and hope I can get to another version soon.&#13;</P

>One other revision of note: this document (as requested by the LDP) is now
under the GFDL.  Enjoy.&#13;</P
