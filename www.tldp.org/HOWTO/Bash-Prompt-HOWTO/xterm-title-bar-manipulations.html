>I'm not sure that these escape sequences strictly qualify as "ANSI Escape
Sequences," but in practice their use is almost identical so I've included
them in this chapter.&#13;</P

>Non-printing escape sequences can be used to produce interesting effects in
prompts.  To use these escape sequences, you need to enclose them in

>Section 3.4</A
>, telling Bash to ignore this material
while calculating the size of the prompt.  Failing to include these
delimiters results in line editing code placing the cursor incorrectly
because it doesn't know the actual size of the prompt.  Escape sequences
must also be preceded by <TT

><B

>If you try to change the title bar of your Xterm with your prompt
when you're at the console, you'll produce garbage in your prompt.
To avoid this, test the TERM environment variable to tell if your prompt
is going to be in an Xterm.&#13;</P

>This is a function that can be incorporated into
<TT

>.  The
function name could then be called to execute the function.  The function,
like the PS1 string, is stored in the environment.  Once the PS1 string is
set by the function, you can remove the function from the environment with
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>unset proml</B
></TT
>.  Since the prompt can't 
change from being in an Xterm
to being at the console, the TERM variable isn't tested every time the
prompt is generated.  I used continuation markers (backslashes) in the
definition of the prompt, to allow it to be continued on multiple lines.
This improves readability, making it easier to modify and debug.</P
><P
>The first step in creating this prompt is to test if the shell we're
starting is an xterm or not: if it is, the shell variable (${TITLEBAR}) is
defined.  It consists of the appropriate escape sequences, and
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>\u@\h:\w</B
></TT
>, which puts
&#60;user&#62;@&#60;machine&#62;:&#60;working directory&#62; in the Xterm title
bar.  This is particularly useful with minimized Xterms, making them more
rapidly identifiable.  The other material in this prompt should be familiar
from previous prompts we've created.  &#13;</P
><P
>The only drawback to manipulating the Xterm title bar like this occurs
when you log into a system on which you haven't set up the title bar hack:
the Xterm will continue to show the information from the previous system
that had the title bar hack in place.&#13;</P

corresponding icon separately.  He uses this under WindowMaker because the
title that's appropriate for an Xterm is usually too long for a 64x64 icon.
"\[\e]1;icon-title\007\e]2;main-title\007\]".  He says to set this in the
prompt command because <SPAN

>"I tried putting the string in PS1, but it
causes flickering under some window managers because it results in setting
the prompt multiple times when you are editing a multi-line command (at
least under bash 1.4.x -- and I was too lazy to fully explore the reasons
behind it)."</SPAN
>  I had no trouble with it in the PS1 string, but didn't
use any multi-line commands.  He also points out that it works under xterm,
xwsh, and dtterm, but not gnome-terminal (which uses only the main title).
I also found it to work with rxvt, but not kterm.  &#13;</P
