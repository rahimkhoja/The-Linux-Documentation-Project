>&#13;      In the acl section (following <TT
CLASS="option"
>begin acl</TT
>), we
      need to define these ACLs.  In doing so, we will incorporate
      some of the basic
      <EM
><A
HREF="techniques.html"
>Techniques</A
></EM
>
      described earlier in this document, namely
      <EM

HREF="dnschecks.html"
>DNS checks</A
></EM
> and
      <EM
><A
HREF="smtpchecks.html"
>SMTP checks</A
></EM
>. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In this pass, we will do most of the checks in <A
HREF="exim-firstpass.html#acl_rcpt_to_1"
>acl_rcpt_to</A
>, and leave the other ACLs largely
      empty.  That is because most of the commonly used ratware does
      not understand rejections early in the SMTP transaction - it
      keeps trying.  On the other hand, most ratware clients give up
      if the <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT TO:</B
> fails.
    </P

>&#13;      We create all these ACLs, however, because we will use them
      later.
