>2.5. Sender Authorization Schemes</H1
><P
>&#13;      Various schemes have been developed for sender verification
      where not only the validity, but also the authenticity, of
      the sender address is checked.  The owner of a internet
      domain specifies certain criteria that must be fulfilled in
      authentic deliveries from senders within that domain.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Two early proposed schemes of this kind were:
    </P

      <TT

>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:user@domain.com"

><P
>&#13;	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Server Policy Framework"</SPAN
> (previously
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Sender Permitted From"</SPAN
>) is perhaps the most
	well-known scheme for sender authorization.  It is loosely
	based on the original schemes described above, but allows
	for a bit more flexibility in the criteria that can be
	posted by the domain holder.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	SPF information is published as a <TT
CLASS="option"
>TXT</TT
>
	record in a domain's top-level DNS zone.  This record can
	specify:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    which hosts are allowed to send mail from that domain
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    the mandatory presence of a GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)
	    signature in outgoing mail from the domain
	  </P
></LI

><P
>&#13;	    other criteria; see

HREF="http://spf.pobox.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://spf.pobox.com/</A
> for details.
	  </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;	The structure of the <B
CLASS="command"
>TXT</B
> record is still
	undergoing development, however basic features to accomplish
	the above are in place.  It starts with the string
	<TT
CLASS="option"
>v=spf1</TT
>, followed by such modifiers as:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    <TT
CLASS="option"
>a</TT
> - the IP address of
	    the domain itself is a valid sender host
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    <TT
CLASS="option"
>mx</TT
> - the incoming mail exchanger for
	    that domain is also a valid sender
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    <TT
CLASS="option"
>ptr</TT
> - if a rDNS lookup of the
	    sending host's IP address yields a name within the
	    domain portion of the sender address, it is a valid
	    sender.
	  </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;	Each of these modifiers may be prefixed with a plus sign (+),
	minus sign (-), question mark (?), or tilde (~) to indicate
	whether it specifies an authorative source, an non-authorative
	source, a neutral stance, or a likely non-authorative source,
	respectively.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Each modifier may also be extended with a colon, followed by
	an alternate domain name.  For instance, if you are a Comcast
	subscriber, your own DNS zone may include the string
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="option"
>-ptr:client.comcast.net
	ptr:comcast.net</TT
>"</SPAN
> to indicate that your
	outgoing e-mail never comes from a host that resolves to
	<TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>anything</I
></TT
>.client.comcast.net, but could
	come from other hosts that resolve to
	<TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>anything</I
></TT
><TT
CLASS="option"
>.comcast.net</TT
>.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	SPF information is currently published for a number of
	high-profile internet domains, such as aol.com,
	altavista.com, dyndns.org, earthlink.net, and google.com.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Sender authorization schemes in general and SPF in particular
	are not universally accepted.  In particular, one objection is
	that domain holders may effectively establish a monopoly on
	relaying outgoing mail from their users/customers.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Another objection is that SPF breaks traditional e-mail
	forwarding - the forwarding host may not have the authority to
	do so per the SPF information in the envelope sender domain.
	This is partly addressed via <A

>2.5.2. Microsoft Caller-ID for E-Mail</H2
><P
>&#13;	Similar to SPF, in that acceptance criteria are posted
	via a TXT record in the sending domain's DNS zone.
	However, rather than relying on simple keywords, MS CIDE
	information consists of fairly large structures encoded in
	XML.  The XML schema is published under a license by
	Microsoft.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	While SPF would nominally be used to check the <A
HREF="gloss.html#envfrom"
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Envelope Sender</I
></A
> address of an e-mail, MS CIDE is
	mainly a tool to validate the RFC 2822 header of the
	message itself.  Thus, the earliest point at which such a
	check could be applied would be after the message data has
	been delivered, before issuing the final
	<B
CLASS="command"
>250</B
> response.

>2.5.3. RMX++</H2
><P
>&#13;	(part of <EM
>Simple Caller Authorization Framework -
	SCAF</EM
>).  This scheme is developed by Hadmut Danisch,
	who also conceived of the original RMX.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	RMX++ allows for dynamic authorization by way of HTTP servers.
	The domain owner publishes a server location via DNS, and the
	receiving host contacts that server in order to obtain an
	<EM
>authorization record</EM
> to verify the
	authenticity of the caller.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	This scheme allows the domain owner more fine-grained control
	of criteria used to authenticate the sender address, without
	having to publicly reveal the structure of their network (as
	with SPF information in static TXT records).  For instance, an
	example from Hadmut is an authorization server that allows no
	more than five messages from a given address per day after
	business hours, then issues an alert once the limit has been
	reached.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Moreover, SCAF is not limited to e-mail, but can also be used
	to provide caller authentication for other services such as
	Voice over IP (VoIP).  
      </P
><P
>&#13;	One possible downside with RMX++, as noted by Rick Stewart
	<TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:rick.stewart (at) theinternetco.net"
>rick.stewart (at) theinternetco.net</A
>&#62;</TT
>, is its
	impact on machine and network resources: Replies from HTTP
	servers are not as widely cached as information obtained
	directly via DNS, and it is signifcantly more expensive to
	make an HTTP request than a DNS request.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Further, Rick notes that the dynamic nature of RMX++ makes
	faults harder to track.  If there is a five-message-per-day
	limit, as in the example above, and one message gets checked
	five times, then the limit is hit with a single message.  It
	makes re-checking a message impossible.
      </P
