><P
>&#13;        The simplest way to add SMTP transaction delays is to append a
        <TT
CLASS="option"
>delay</TT
> control to the final
        <TT
CLASS="option"
>accept</TT
> statement in each of the ACLs we have
        declared, as follows:

<TABLE

WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;  accept
    delay = 20s
</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;        In addition, you may want to add progressive delays in the
        <TT
CLASS="option"
>deny</TT
> statement pertaining to invalid
        recipients (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"unknown user"</SPAN
>) within <A
HREF="exim-firstpass.html#acl_rcpt_to_1"
>acl_rcpt_to</A
>.  This is to slow down dictionary
        attacks.  For instance:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;  deny
    message     = unknown user
    !verify     = recipient/callout=20s,defer_ok,use_sender
    delay       = ${eval:$rcpt_fail_count*10 + 20}s
</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;        It should be noted that there is no point in imposing a delay
        in <A
HREF="exim-firstpass.html#acl_data_1"
>acl_data</A
>, after the message data has
        been received.  Ratware commonly disconnect at this point,
        before even receiving a response from your server.  In any
        case, whether or not the client disconnects at this point has
        no bearing on whether Exim will proceed with the delivery of
        the message.

>A.5.2. Selective Delays</H2
><P
>&#13;        If you are like me, you want to be a little bit more selective
        about which hosts you subject to SMTP transaction delays.  For
        instance, as described earlier in this document, you may
        decide that a match from a DNS blacklist or a non-verifiable
        EHLO/HELO greeting are not conditions that by themselves
        warrant a rejection - but they may well be sufficient triggers
        for transaction delays.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        In order perform selective delays, we want move some of the
        checks that we previously did in <A
HREF="exim-firstpass.html#acl_rcpt_to_1"
>acl_rcpt_to</A
> to earlier points in the SMTP
        transaction.  This is so that we can start imposing the delays
        as soon as we see any sign of trouble, and thereby increase
        the chance of causing synchronization errors and other trouble
        for ratware.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Specifically, we want to:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;            Move the DNS checks to
            <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_connect_final"
>acl_connect</A
>.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            Move the Hello checks to <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_helo_final"
>acl_helo</A
>.
            One exception: We cannot yet check for a missing Hello
            greeting at this point, because this ACL is processed
            <EM
>in response</EM
> to an EHLO or HELO
            command.  We will do this check in the <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_mail_from_final"
>acl_mail_from</A
> ACL.
          </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            Move the Sender Address Checks checks to <A

>acl_mail_from</A
>.
          </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;        However, for reasons described above, we do not want to
        actually reject the mail until after the <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT
        TO:</B
> command.  Instead, in the earlier ACLs, we
        will convert the various <TT
CLASS="option"
>deny</TT
> statements
        into <TT
CLASS="option"
>warn</TT
> statements, and use Exim's
        general purpose ACL variables to store any error messages or
        warnings until after the <B
CLASS="command"
>RCPT TO:</B
>
        command.  We do that as follows:
      </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;            If we decide to reject the delivery, we store an error
            message to be used in the forthcoming
            <B
CLASS="command"
>550</B

            <TT

><P
>&#13;                If we identify the condition before a mail delivery
                has started (i.e. in
                <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_connect_final"
>acl_connect</A

                <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_helo_final"

                connection-persistent variable
                <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_c0</TT
>
              </P
></LI

><P
>&#13;                Once a mail transaction has started (i.e. after the
                <B

> command), we copy any
                contents from <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_c0</TT

                message-specific variable <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_m0</TT

                and use the latter from this point forward.  This
                way, any conditions identified in this particular
                message will not affect any subsequent messages
                received in the same connection.
              </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;            Also, we store a corresponding <EM
>log
            message</EM
> in <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_c1</TT
> or
            <TT

><P
>&#13;            If we come across a condition that does not warrant an

            <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_c1</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_m1</TT
>.
            Once a mail transaction has started (i.e. in <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_mail_from_final"
>acl_mail_from</A
>), we add any content in
            this variable to the message header as well.

>&#13;            If we decide to <EM
>accept</EM

            without regard to the results of any subsequent checks
            (such as a SpamAssassin scan), we set a flag in
            <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_c0</TT

CLASS="varname"
>$acl_m0</TT
>, but

            empty.

>&#13;            At the beginning of every ACL to and including <A
HREF="exim-final.html#acl_mail_from_final"
>acl_mail_from</A
>, we record the current
            timestamp in <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_m2</TT
>.  At the end of the
            ACL, we use the presence of <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$acl_c1</TT
> or
            <TT
CLASS="varname"

>&#13;        As an example of this approach, let us consider two checks

        reject mails if the peer greets with an IP address, and one
        that will warn about an unverifiable name in the greeting.
        Previously, we did both of these checks in <A
