<P>While there are arguments which can be made for many different network
layouts, the requirements of many organizations can be met by putting
the desktop machines and private servers on a private masqueraded
subnet, and the publicly accessible machines on valid external
IPs. The machines on valid external IPs will be referred to in this
document as ``exposed hosts''. This leads to the following (example)
topology:

<P>
<P>In this example, the router provided by the ISP (Internet Service
Provider), FTP server, WWW servers, and the machine labelled ``private
network gateway'' all have externally visible IP numbers, while the
desktop and private server machines have IP numbers allocated from
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt">RFC 1918</A>,
reserved for private use. The IP numbers you choose for use within the
private network (everything below the private network gateway
machine) should be chosen to be unique, not only among the hosts under
your control, but should also not conflict with numbers assigned on
similar private subnets at other sites or partner companies with whom
you might, at some time, want to implement a virtual private network,
in order to reduce confusion and reconfiguration when the networks are
merged in that way. As outlined in the RFC, you can choose from any
class C network from 192.168.0.* to 192.168.255.*, or any class B
network from 172.16.*.* to 172.31.*.*, or the class A network
10.*.*.*. In the rest of this document I will assume that your private
network (if you've chosen to create one) is on the class C network
192.168.1.*, and your private network gateway machine is at IP number
10.1.1.9, one of the IP numbers provided to you by your provider (note
that this is not a valid external IP, I use it as an example only). I
will also assume that there is a machine, betty.example.com, at
10.1.1.10, which will handle both www and FTP services.
<P>
<P>Take note of the number of external IP numbers which you need for your
own machines. You will need one IP number for each machine which lies
outside the private network gateway, plus one for the gateway
itself. This count does not include any IP numbers which may be taken
by routers, broadcast addresses, and so on. You should ask your
provider for a block of addresses large enough to mount the given
number of machines. For example, in my office network, of the 8 IP
numbers allocated from the ISP, three were not usable by my
computers, leaving enough IP numbers for four machines outside the
gateway, plus the gateway itself.
<P>
<P>This network topology is not correct for everybody, but it is a
reasonable starting point for many configurations which don't have
special needs. The advantages of this configuration include:
<UL>
<LI>Easy expandability. If you suddenly double your number of
private nodes, you don't have to worry about getting a new IP block
from your provider and reconfiguring all of the interfaces on your
machines.  </LI>
<LI>Local network control. Adding a new workstation to your private
network requires no communication with your provider, unlike exposed
nodes, which need both forward and reverse DNS (domain name service)
mappings if they are to perform certain tasks (ssh and ftpd may
complain if they can't perform reverse and forward DNS on incoming
connections). A reverse DNS query is an attempt to obtain the host name
from the IP number.</LI>
<LI>Centralized security. The private network gateway can enforce
security over the whole private network, filtering packets and logging
attacks, rather than having to install such measures on each desktop
and server on the private network. This can be enforced not only on
incoming packets, but also on outgoing packets, so that a
misconfigured desktop machine doesn't inadvertently broadcast data
to the outside world which ought to remain internal.</LI>
<LI>Easy transplantability. Because the IP numbers within the
private network are yours for as long as you want them, you can move
the entire network to a new range of IP numbers without having to make
any changes to the network configuration on the private network. The
publicly exposed hosts still have to be reconfigured, of course.</LI>
<LI>Transparent Internet access. The machines on your private
network can still use FTP, telnet, WWW, and other services with
minimal obstruction, assuming a Linux masquerading router. The users
may not even be aware that their machines are not on externally
visible IP numbers.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Some of the potential disadvantages of such a configuration are:
<UL>
<LI>Some services will not be available directly to the machines on
the internal network. NTP synchronization against an outside host,
certain obscure services which may not have masquerading rules in the
kernel, and .shosts authentication for logging in to external nodes
are all difficult or impossible, but simple workarounds are almost
always available.</LI>
<LI>More network hardware costs. The private network gateway machine
needs two network cards, and you need at least two hubs / switches,
one on the visible network and one on the private network.</LI>
<LI>Machines outside the private network cannot easily make direct
connections to machines within the private network. They may have to
open a session first on the private network gateway machine, then log
through to the internal host. It is possible to route packets
transparently through the firewall, but this is not recommended for
security reasons which will be discussed in a later section.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>You should consider these points in planning your network topology,
and decide if a fully visible network is more appropriate for your
situation. In the rest of this document I will assume that you have
configured your network as shown above. If you have chosen to have a
fully visible network, some details will differ, and I will try to
point out such differences in this document.
<P>
<P>As a special case, if you do not need any external servers, the
ISP-supplied router can be attached directly to your external
interface on the private network gateway machine, rather than with a
hub.
