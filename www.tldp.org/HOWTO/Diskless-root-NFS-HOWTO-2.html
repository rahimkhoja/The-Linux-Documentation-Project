<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Basic principle</A> </H2>

<P>As already said with this setup the clients share basicly the entire root-fs
with the server. But the clients ofcourse only get read access to it. This
is basicly how things work. 
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Things can't be that simple</A>
 </H2>

<P>Unfortunatly things aren't that simple, there are a couple of problems
the overcome with this simple setup.
<H3>Each ws needs its own writable copy of a number of dirs </H3>

<P>A normal linux setup needs to have write access to the following dirs:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>/dev</LI>
<LI>/var</LI>
<LI>/tmp</LI>
</OL>
<P>There are 3 solutions for this, of which one will only work for /dev:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>mount a ramdisk and populate it by untarring a tarball, or by copying a
template dir.
<UL>
<LI>Advantages:
<OL>
<LI>It's cleaned up every reboot, which removes tmp files and logs. Thus it
needs no maintaince unlike server sided dirs.</LI>
<LI>It doesn't take up any space on the server, and that it doesn't generate
any network traffic. A ramdisk takes less server and network resources, and
is faster.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Disadvantages:
<OL>
<LI>It takes memory.</LI>
<LI>The logs aren't kept after a reboot, if you really want logging of all
your clients tell syslog to redirect the logging to your server.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>create a dir for each ws on the server and mount it rw over nfs.
<UL>
<LI>Advantages &amp; disadvantages:
<OL>
<LI>The above arguments work in reverse for serversided dirs.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>With kernel 2.2 devfs can be used for /dev, this is a virtual filesystem
ala /proc for /dev.
<UL>
<LI>Advantages:
<OL>
<LI>Devfs takes very little memory when compared to a ramdisk / no diskspace
on the server and is very fast. A normal /dev takes at least 1.5 mb since the
minimal size for a file (and thus for a device) is 1k, and there are somewhere
around 1200 devices. You can offcourse use a template of a stripped /dev with
only the entries you need to save some space. 1.5 Mb is a lott for a ramdisk
and also isn't nice on a server.</LI>
<LI>Devfs automagicly creates entries for newly added &amp; detected devices,
so no maintainance is needed.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Disadvantages:
<OL>
<LI>Any changes to /dev like creating symlinks for the mouse and cdrom are
lost. Devfs comes with a script called rc.devfs to save these chances. The
script's provided in this howto will automagicly restore these symlinks settings
by calling rc.devfs If you make any changes to /dev you need to call the rc.devfs
yourself to save them by typing:</LI>
</OL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
/etc/rc.d/rc.devfs save /etc/sysconfig
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>As you can see, there are a number of ways to solve this problem. For the
rest of this Howto the following choices are assumed:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>For /dev we'll use Devfs</LI>
<LI>For /var and /tmp we'll use a shared ramdisk of 1mb. It's shared to use
the space as effeciently as possible. /tmp is replaced by a symlink to /var/tmp
to make the sharing possible.</LI>
<LI>Populating the ramdisk with tarballs or template dirs, works equally well.
But with template dirs it's much easier to make changes, thus we'll use template
dirs.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Write access to /home might be needed </H3>

<P>Not really a problem in every unix client/server setup /home is mounted
rw from the server so we'll just do that ;) 
<H3>How does a ws find out it's ip so that it can communicate with the server? </H3>

<P>Luckily for us, this problem has already been solved and the linux kernel
has support for 2 ways of autoconfiguration of the ip-address:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>RARP</LI>
<LI>Bootp</LI>
</OL>
<P>Rarp is the easiest to setup, bootp is the most flexible. Since most bootroms
only support bootp that's what we'll use.
<H3>What about ws sepecific configuration </H3>

<P>On redhat most system dependent config files are already in /etc/sysconfig
We'll just move those which aren't there and add symlinks. Then we mount a
seperate /etc/sysconfig on a per ws basis. This is really the only distribution
dependent part on other distributions you can just create a sysconfig dir,
move all config files which can't be shared there and create symlinks. Also
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d, or symilar on other dists, might need to be different for
the server resp the workstations. Assuming that all ws run the same services
in runlevel 3, we'll just create a seperate 3th runlevel for the workstations
and the server:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Create both a /etc/rc.d/rc3.ws and a /etc/rc.d/rc3.server</LI>
<LI>make /etc/rc.d/rc3.d a symlink to /etc/sysconfig/rc3.d</LI>
<LI>make /etc/sysconfig/rc3.d a symlink to the apropiate /etc/rc.d/rc3.xxx</LI>
<LI>replace S99local in rc3.ws by a link to /etc/sysconfig/rc.local so that
each ws can have it's own rc.local</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Miscelancious problems </H3>

<P>There are a few problems left:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit needs /var, so /var needs to be mounted or created
before /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit is run. It would also be nice if the ws-specific
/etc/sysconfig is mounted before any initscripts are run.
<UL>
<LI>We'll just source a bootup script for the ws in the very top of /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit.
Note this script will then ofcourse also be sourced by the server itself on
boot, so the script has to detect this and do nothing on the server.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>/etc/mtab needs to be writable:
<UL>
<LI>This is a tricky one, just create a link to /proc/mounts and create an
empty file mounts in /proc so that fsck and mount don't complain during the
initscripts when /proc isn't mounted yet. One note smb(u)mount doesn't respect
mtab being a link and overwrites it. Thus if you want to use smb(u)mount create
wrapper scripts that restore the symlink.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>
