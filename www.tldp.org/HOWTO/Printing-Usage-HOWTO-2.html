<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Printing Under Linux</A></H2>

<P>This section discusses how to print files, examine the print queue, remove
jobs from the print queue, format files before printing them, and configure
your printing environment.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 History of Linux Printing</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
printing!history of
-->

The Linux printing system---the <EM>lp</EM> system---is a port of the source
code written by the Regents of the University of California for the Berkeley
Software Distribution version of the UNIX operating system.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Printing a File Using <EM>lpr</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
printing!using lpr command
-->

<!--
lpr command!usage example
-->

By far, the most simplistic way to print in the Linux operating system is
to send the file to be printed directly to the printing device.  One way
to do this is to use the <EM>cat</EM> command.  As the <CODE>root</CODE> user,
one could do something like
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cat thesis.txt > /dev/lp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this case, <CODE>/dev/lp</CODE> is a symbolic link to the actual printing
device---be it a dot-matrix, laser printer, typesetter, or plotter.  (See
<EM>ln</EM>(1) for more information on symbolic links.)
<P>For the purpose of security, only the <CODE>root</CODE> user and users in the
same group as the print daemon are able to write directly to the printer.
This is why commands such as <EM>lpr</EM>, <EM>lprm</EM>, and <EM>lpq</EM>
have to be used to access the printer.
<P>Because of this, users have to use <EM>lpr</EM> to print a file.  The
<EM>lpr</EM> command takes care of all the initial work needed to print
the file, and then it hands control over to another program, <EM>lpd</EM>,
the line printing daemon.  The line printing daemon then tells the printer
how to print the file.
<P>When <EM>lpr</EM> is executed, it first copies the specified file to a
certain directory (the spool directory) where the file remains until
<EM>lpd</EM> prints it.  Once <EM>lpd</EM> is told that there is a file to
print, it will spawn a copy of itself (what we programmers call forking). 
This copy will print our file while the original copy waits for more
requests.  This allows for multiple jobs to be queued at once.
<P>The syntax of <EM>lpr</EM>(1) is a very familiar one,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lpr [ options ] [ filename ... ]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If <CODE>filename</CODE> is not specified, <EM>lpr</EM> expects input to come
from standard input (usually the keyboard, or another program's output). 
This enables the user to redirect a command's output to the print spooler. 
As such,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cat thesis.txt | lpr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ pr -l60 thesis.txt | lpr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <EM>lpr</EM> command accepts several command-line arguments that allow a
user to control how it works.  Some of the most widely used arguments are:
-<B>P</B>printer specifies the printer to use, -<B>h</B> suppresses printing of
the burst page, -<B>s</B> creates a symbolic link instead of copying the file
to the spool directory (useful for large files), and -<B>#</B>num
specifies the number of copies to print.  An example interaction with
<EM>lpr</EM> might be something like
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lpr -#2 -sP dj thesis.txt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command will create a symbolic link to the file <CODE>thesis.txt</CODE> in
the spool directory for the printer named <EM>dj</EM>, where it would be
processed by <EM>lpd</EM>.  It would then print a second copy of
<CODE>thesis.txt</CODE>.
<P>For a listing of all the options that <EM>lpr</EM> will recognize, see
<EM>lpr</EM>(1).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Viewing the Print Queue with <EM>lpq</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
printing!using lpq command
-->

<!--
lpq command!usage example
-->

To view the contents of the print queue, use the <EM>lpq</EM> command. 
Issued without arguments, it returns the contents of the default printer's
queue.
<P>The returned output of <EM>lpq</EM> can be useful for many purposes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lpq
lp is ready and printing

</H2>

<P>
<!--
printing!using lprm command
-->

<!--
lprm command!usage example
-->

Another useful feature of any printing system is the ability to cancel a job
that has been previously queued.  To do this, use <EM>lprm</EM>.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lprm -
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The above command cancels all of the print jobs that are owned by the user
who issued the command.  A single print job can be canceled by first getting
the job number as reported by <EM>lpq</EM> and then giving that number to
<EM>lprm</EM>.  For example,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lprm 31
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>would cancel job 31 (<CODE>thesis.txt</CODE>) on the default printer.

</H2>

<P>
<!--
printing!using lpc command
-->

<!--
lpc command!usage example
-->

The <EM>lpc</EM>(8) program is used to control the printers that lpd serves. 
you can enable or disable a printer or its queues, rearrange entries within
a queue, and get a status report on the printers and their queues.
Lpc is mostly used in a setup where there are multiple printers hanging off
one machine.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lpc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The above will start the lpc program.  By default, this enters you into
an interactive mode, and you can begin issuing commands.  The other option
is to issue an lpc command on the command line.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ lpc status all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A list of the available commands are in the <EM>lpd</EM> man page, but here
are a few of the major commands you'll want to know about.  Any commands
marked with <EM>option</EM> can either be a printer name (lp, print, etc) or
the keyword <CODE>all</CODE>, which means all printers. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> disable <EM>option</EM> -  prevents any new printer job from being entered</LI>
<LI> down <EM>option</EM> - disables all printing on the printer</LI>
<LI> enable <EM>option</EM> - allow new jobs to enter the print queue</LI>
<LI> quit (or exit) - leave lpc</LI>
<LI> restart <EM>option</EM> - restarts lpd for that printer</LI>
<LI> status <EM>option</EM> - print status of printer</LI>
<LI> up <EM>option</EM> - enable everything and start a new lpd</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 The RedHat printtool</A>
</H2>

<P>

<!--
printool utility
-->

Just a quick note here on RedHat's amazing printtool program.  It seems
to do everything that a magicfilter would do.  RedHat already installs many
of the programs to do the filtering.  Here's how I have my printer set up
under RH 4.0 with an HP LJ 4L connected to my parallel port (should be
the same for other versions of RH as well).
<UL>
<LI>Become root and fire up printtool (if you su'ed, you remembered to
SETENV DISPLAY :0.0 and xhost +, right?)</LI>
<LI>Click "Add", and hit "OK" for a local printer.</LI>
<LI>Fill in the printer device (/dev/lp1 for me)</LI>
<LI>Fill in the input filter - Select a printer type, resolution, and paper
size (ljet4, 300x300, and letter)</LI>
<LI>Hit "OK" all the way back, and restart the lpd.</LI>
</UL>

Just like rolling an /etc/printcap file by hand, you can have multiple
printer definitions for each physical printer.  One for different paper
sizes, resolutions, etc.
