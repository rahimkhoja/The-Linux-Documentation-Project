<P>During the spring of 1996 I've seen a lot of posts in comp.os.linux.x
asking how to convert video modes between XFree86 and one of its
commercial alternatives: XInside ( now named XiGraphics, note anyway
that in this document I'll use the old product name, since I will mainly
refer to that version )
<P>I had evaluated before the product and had this evaluation version still
floating on my hard disk: since I like problem solving, I've decided to
give it a try and, after a couple of hours of fiddling and calculating,
I came up with a supposedly informative article that was promptly posted.
<P>The discussions about how to convert suddendly vanished and I received
1 (one) mail thanking me for the article so, since maybe somebody else
could need this information in the future, I decided to transform that
post in the mini-HOWTO you are reading.
<P>Let me state something first: I do NOT work for XInside and I only had
access to the evaluation 1.2 version for Linux. I know that nowadays (
May 97 ) AccelX has reached revision 3.1, but I do think that the
information included in this document, if not verbatim, is still
applicable.
<P>Due to the fact that this HOWTO has been written with the help of a
pretty old Xinside version, it may well happen that some of the
information contained here is not completely accurate: as you will read
later, thanks to the birth of XFree 3.2, I haven't bought this
commercial server, so if you have, and if you notice any incorrect
information here please take the time to email me.
<P>Notice anyway that fiddling with monitor timings can be
hazardous and, for this reason, I absolutely make no guarantees. If it
works for you , fine, if you blow up your computer I shall not be held
responsible for it.
<P>As you may have noticed from may name, I'm not a native speaker of English
so you will probably find some errors here and there, I apologize for them
and I ask you to please avoid flooding my mailbox with language-related
flames. Thanks !
