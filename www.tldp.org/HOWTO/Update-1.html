Development in the world of Linux takes place at an incredible speed and it
can be difficult to keep abreast with the latest development. This HOWTO
gives you a few guidelines on how to get the information you need, fast and
efficiently. Most are quite familiar with using the World Wide Web (WWW)
and Usenet News but as will be shown here there are many other methods that
can be as good or even better.
<P>
<P>There are now many new translations available and special thanks go
to the translators for the job and the input they have given:
