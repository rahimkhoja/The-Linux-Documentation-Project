<H2><A NAME="s2">2. NOWTO - a quick install guide</A></H2>

<P>If you want sound and you want it NOW! and not after reading this HOWTO, this quick tour through
the ALSA driver installation might be of help. Please note: there are a couple of differences between
the ALSA versions that support 2.0 kernels and those that support 2.2 kernels.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Installing ALSA for kernels 2.2.x</A>
</H2>

<P>You will probably want to use the ALSA 0.4.1e (or later) version if your kernel is 2.2.x.
If your kernel is older, please use 0.3.0-pre4 and see below.
<P>Just the all time ``./configure - make - make install'' stuff. Do this for <B>drivers, library and utilities</B>.
You need all three because the utilities help you to unmute your card. Kernels 2.2.x need to have <B>general 
sound support</B> in the kernel (without choosing a specific card).
<P>The ALSA drivers have their own devices, you can make them usinge the <B>./snddevices</B> script.
<P>You need to load the module for your card (or use kmod)
and if you want sound to be backwards compatible with the Linux kernel sound drivers (yes you want this) you need
two other modules called <B>snd-pcm1-oss</B> and <B>snd-mixer-oss</B>. See the section 
<A HREF="Alsa-sound-5.html#which-modul">Which module for which card</A> to find
out which module to load. After loading, you can look in /proc/asound
for various information about the ALSA drivers.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Playing and recording sound</A>
</H2>

<P>A few remarks. ALSA has it's own devices in /dev/snd, for example /dev/snd/pcmC0D1 is Card 0, Device 1. 
You can use the old /dev/pcmXY devices if you loaded snd-pcm1-oss for backwards compatibility. You'll also want
to use /dev/mixer, so load snd-mixer-oss as well. Before you can
play any sound, you need to unmute the card with ``amixer''. Type ``amixer groups'', then try something like 
<P><CODE>amixer set PCM 100 unmute</CODE>
<P>Generally you can use options ``mute'' or ``unmute'', ``capture'' or ``nocapture'' and numbers.
<P>That's it! Now if it works, it works. If it doesn't work, you may need to actually read this HOWTO...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Installing ALSA for 2.0.x</A>
</H2>

<P>The ALSA drivers versions 0.3.0, 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 have various problems due to the
restructuring of the mixer interface. Later versions do not support kernel 2.0.x, so you definately will want to
use version 0.3.0-pre4 if you have a 2.0 version kernel.
<P>Just the all time ``./configure - make - make install'' stuff. Do this for <B>drivers, library and utilities</B>.
You need all three because the utilities help you to unmute your card. Kernels 2.0.x need to have all <B>sound
support disabled</B> in the kernel setup
<P>The ALSA drivers have their own devices, you can make them usinge the <B>./snddevices</B> script.
<P>You need to load the module for your card (or use kmod)
and if you want sound to be backwards compatible with the Linux kernel sound drivers (yes you want this) you need
another modules called <B>snd-pcm1-oss</B>. See the section 
<A HREF="Alsa-sound-5.html#which-modul">Which module for which card</A> to find
out which module to load. After loading, you can look in /proc/asound
for various information about the ALSA drivers.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Playing and recording sound</A>
</H2>

<P>A few remarks. ALSA has it's own devices in /dev/snd, for example /dev/snd/pcmC0D1 is Card 0, Device 1. 
You can use the old /dev/pcmXY devices if you loaded snd-pcm1-oss for backwards compatibility. Before you can
play any sound, you need to unmute the card with ``amixer''. Type ``amixer'', then try something like 
<P><CODE>amixer pcm 100 unmute</CODE>
<P>Generally you can use options ``mute'' or ``unmute'', ``rec'' or ``norec'', numbers or left:right.
<P>That's it! Now if it works, it works. If it doesn't work, you may need to actually read this HOWTO...
