>I must point out that I would not have known how to fix the i810 and X4.x 
problem if it were not for the pioneering efforts of Val Henson who guided me 
through the process and recommended the 2.4.x kernel in the first place. And 
now that this is an ammended version, I would also like to thank Heron Ordonez 
for pointing out a few problems which I have in part addressed, and will fully 
address in due course. Curtis Stone pointed out to me that the features I 
thought only available in the 2.4.x kernel were present in 2.2.18. Thanks to 
him too. I am now also endebted to Cameron Kerr for pointing out that the 2.4.x 
kernel must not be unpacked in /usr/src/linux. I had had no success with the 
2.4.x until this was pointed out to me, but would have been OK had I read the 
accompanying README, ie followed my own instructions. </P

>If this process carries on in this fashion the 'Thank you' will one 
day be the largest section of this HOWTO. This is an open process and all 
comments (politely phrased of course!) are welcome.</P
