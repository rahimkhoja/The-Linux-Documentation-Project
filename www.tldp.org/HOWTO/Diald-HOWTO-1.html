</H2>

<P>
<P>This document shows some typical scenarios for easy start using
<EM>Diald</EM>.
These scenarios include a connection from a standalone computer to an ISP
using PPP over a modem without using <CODE>pon/poff</CODE> or
<CODE>ppp-on/ppp-off</CODE> to a proxy/firewall server with different Internet
connections through various ISPs.
<P>In the present document, the following scenarios will be treated:
<UL>
<LI>Connecting a standalone computer to an ISP using a modem and PPP</LI>
<LI>Conecting a computer to a group of different ISPs with a modem and PPP</LI>
<LI>Connecting a proxy/firewall to an ISP using a modem and PPP</LI>
</UL>
<P>In following versions of this document, other scenarios will be added, as
multiple instances of <EM>Diald</EM>, ISDN lines and lines used to call and
receive calls.
<P>Before this document, a Diald-mini-Howto exist, wrote by Harish Pillay
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:h.pillay@ieee.org">h.pillay@ieee.org</A></CODE>, that presented and example of connection
to an ISP using a chat based authentication scheme (login and password
previous to the pppd start, with no use of PAP or CHAP).
<P>Example configuration files will be included in this document to serve as
starting point to get <EM>Diald</EM> up. To obtain maximum performance and all
programs attributes, it is necesary you read all documentation from the
programs and reconfigure the example configuration files included here.
<P>Finally, configuration files can be in different directories depending on
what GNU/Linux distribution you are using. If you find a file commented
here in other directory, please, write me.

</H2>

<P>
<P>I want to be grateful to the people that help me to get my first
<EM>Diald</EM> up and running with their example files (somebody who's name i
forgot, Mr Cornish Rex, Hoo Kok Mun and John Dalbec), to the people that
have wrote me to send corrections and suggestions for this document (Tim
Coleman, Jacob Joseph, Paul Schmidt and Jordi Mallach), to the future
translators of this document to other languages, and, of course, to all
