<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!Taylor versus HDB mode
-->

(religious mode on - I know some people are just as religious about "ease
of use" as I am about "being standard".  That's why they make source code you
can build your own from :-) )
<P>Because IMHO it's the de-facto standard UUCP implementation at this time.
There are thousands of sites with experienced admins &amp; there are many places
you can get incredibly good information concerning the HDB setup.
<P>Moreover, if you know what HDB is, you shouldn't be reading this HOWTO :-)
<P>Use the <CODE>uuconv</CODE> utility in /usr/sbin to convert config files from
one mode to another.

<P>If you use a "Direct" device in the Devices file, there's now a
10 second timeout compiled in.  Make the name of the Device anything
other than "Direct".  If you tweak the example /etc/uucp files
provided, you won't have problems with this one.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> from <EM>Greg Naber - greg at squally.halcyon.com</EM> 
<P>If you get chat script timeouts, you can tweak the sources by 
editing at line 323 in uuconf/syssub.c &amp; changing the default
timeouts from 10 seconds to something larger.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> from <EM>Ed Rodda - ed at orca.wimsey.bc.ca</EM>
<P>If you get chat script timeouts, typically connecting to other
Taylor sites, a pause after login can fix this.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Why doesn't HDB anonymous uucp seem to work?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!HDB anonymous uucp failure
-->

Taylor in HDB mode seems to be sensitive to white space &amp; blank lines.
To be safe, make sure that there are no blank lines or trailing spaces in the
Permissions file.
<P>Lastly, make sure that you have a file called <CODE>remote.unknown</CODE> in
/usr/lib/uucp or /etc/uucp &amp; that it's <EM>*NOT*</EM> executable.
<P>See the O'Reilly &amp; Associates book <CODE>"Managing UUCP &amp; USENET"</CODE> for
details regarding this file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 What does "no matching ports found" mean?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!no matching ports error
-->

In all probability, you are attempting to use a dialer that doesn't exist, or
the dialer you've specified in the port files doesn't match up with any
valid devices in the dial file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 What are known good config files for HDB mode?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!FAQ!config files, known good
-->

The following are "known-good" config files for Taylor 1.05 under Linux in
HoneyDanBer mode.  They work on kernels of 0.99-8 or later. All files should
be in /usr/lib/uucp or /etc/uucp unless you've tweaked the sources to put the
uucp library elsewhere.
<P>If you *HAVE* put things in non-standard places, be aware that things like
sendmail might get very confused. You need to ensure that all
communications-related programs agree on your idea of "standard" paths.

The new v1.05 has an added '-z' switch to uucico that will try alternate
numbers for a remote system.
