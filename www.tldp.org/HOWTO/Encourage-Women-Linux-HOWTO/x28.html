NAME="AEN28">1. Introduction</H1
><P
>At the 2002 Ottawa Linux Symposium, I hosted a LinuxChix Birds
Of a Feather session.  During the BOF and throughout the conference, I
heard the same set of questions:</P
><P
>"My girlfriend hates Windows, how can I encourage her to use
Linux?"</P
><P
>"Almost no women attend my local LUG.  How can I fix this?"</P
><P
>"Why aren't there more women in open source?"</P
><P
>Clearly, people in the Linux community would like for more women
to be involved in Linux, but most people don't know why so few women
are involved or how to change that.  This HOWTO is an effort to
summarize the explanations, recommendations, and opinions of the women
who already are interested and active in Linux.  This document began
with the verbatim recommendations of the women who attended the
LinuxChix BOF, and was added to by many more women in the months
following the original BOF.  In other words, this HOWTO represents the
feelings and opinions of real women involved in Linux.  While we
represent the women who "made it," we still have fairly important
insights into why other women left or never entered the Linux
community, as well as being keenly aware of the pressures which are
currently pushing us out of the community.</P
><P
>In this HOWTO, we'll talk about why women stay out of computing
in general, why they stay away from Linux in particular, and what you
can do to help encourage women in Linux.  We hope that this HOWTO will
result in more women using, installing, and developing Linux.</P

NAME="AEN36">1.1. Audience</H2
><P
>This document is intended mainly for the male Linux enthusiast
who would like to see more women involved in Linux.  Its secondary
audience is both men and women who have been too busy having fun with
Linux and computers to sit down and think about why most women don't
share their interests.  We hope you'll come away from this HOWTO with
some understanding of why women stay away from Linux and with a few
ideas about what you can do to reverse that trend.</P
><P
>This HOWTO is not directed towards people who aren't concerned
about the lack of women in Linux, or think that women are better off
staying away from Linux.  If you don't already believe that women are
being driven away from Linux and computers by external causes, this
HOWTO probably won't convince you otherwise (although it may give you
some interesting avenues of research to follow up on).</P
><P
>This HOWTO is definitely not intended to help male Linux geeks
find female Linux geeks to date.  The central paradox of women and
Linux is this: often, the people most anxious for more women in Linux
are also the people most likely to accidentally drive them away.
Frequently, men who want more women in Linux solely so they have a
better chance of finding a girlfriend end up acting in ways that end
up driving women away instead!  This HOWTO will try to explain which
behaviors drive women away from Linux and which behaviors encourage
them.</P

NAME="AEN41">1.2. What problem?  Sexism is dead!</H2
><P
>A sentiment I hear frequently: "What problem?  There's no
problem!  Sexism is dead!  Women are staying out of Linux because they
want to!"  If you feel this way, you may change your opinion by the
time you finish reading this HOWTO.  I also used to believe that
sexism was dead.  Shortly after joining several women in computing
mailing lists, I realized how wrong I was.  Week after week, women
have new stories about how they were discriminated against and
insulted because they were women.  These stories aren't decades old,
nor do they involve people who grew up when sexism was more
acceptable.  These are day-to-day experiences of today's women, in
modern settings, who are being driven out of their chosen profession
by sexism.  This isn't theoretical--many women actually leave the
field of computers entirely because of blatantly sexist incidents
involving superiors at work or at school.</P

You can argue that the Linux users joking about "over-stressed
females" in the above posts are ignorant, or stupid, or well-meaning,
or should in some way not be labeled sexist, but the result of their
actions is that women are leaving Linux, something we would like to
prevent.</P
