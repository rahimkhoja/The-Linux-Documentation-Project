<H2><A NAME="installing"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Installing Your Shiny New BIND</A></H2>

<P>I should mention that if you have an existing installation of BIND, such as from
an RPM, you should probably remove it before installing the new one.  On Red Hat
systems, this probably means removing the packages <CODE>bind</CODE> and
<CODE>bind-utils</CODE>, and possibly <CODE>bind-devel</CODE> and <CODE>caching-nameserver</CODE>, if
you have them.
<P>You may want to save a copy of the init script (e.g.,
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/named</CODE>), if any, before doing so; it'll be useful later
on.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Installing the Tools Outside the Jail</A>
</H2>

<P>This is the easy part :-).  Just run <CODE>make install</CODE> and let it take care of
it for you.  You may want to <CODE>chmod 000 /usr/local/sbin/named</CODE> afterwards,
to make sure you don't accidentally run the non-chrooted copy of BIND.  (This
is <CODE>/usr/sbin/named</CODE> if you didn't tell it to go in <CODE>/usr/local/sbin</CODE>
like I suggested.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Installing the Binaries in the Jail</A>
</H2>

<P>Only two parts of the package have to live inside the chroot jail:  the main
<CODE>named</CODE> daemon itself, and <CODE>named-xfer</CODE>, which it uses for zone transfers.
You can simply copy them in from the source tree:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp src/bin/named/named /chroot/named/bin

# cp src/bin/named-xfer/named-xfer /chroot/named/bin
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Setting up the Init Script</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have an existing init script from your distribution, it would probably be
best simply to modify it to run <CODE>/chroot/named/bin/named</CODE>, with the
appropriate switches.  The switches are... <I>(drumroll please...)</I>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>-u named</CODE>, which tells BIND to run as the user <CODE>named</CODE>, rather than
<CODE>root</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>-g named</CODE>, to run BIND under the group <CODE>named</CODE> too, rather than
<CODE>root</CODE> or <CODE>wheel</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>-t /chroot/named</CODE>, which tells BIND to chroot itself to the jail
that we've set up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following is the init script I use with my Red Hat 6.0 system.  As you can
see, it is almost exactly the same as the way it shipped from Red Hat.  I have
also modified the <CODE>ndc restart</CODE> command so that it restarts the server
properly, and keeps it chrooted.  You should probably do the same in your init
script, even if you don't copy this one.

<P>On Caldera OpenLinux systems, you simply need to modify the variables defined
at the top, and it will apparently take care of the rest for you:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
NAME=named
DAEMON=/chroot/named/bin/$NAME
OPTIONS="-t /chroot/named -u named -g named"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Configuration Changes</A>
</H2>

<P>You will also have to add or change a few options in your <CODE>named.conf</CODE> to
keep the various directories straight.  In particular, you should add (or
change, if you already have them) the following directives in the <CODE>options</CODE>
section:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
directory "/etc/namedb";
pid-file "/var/run/named.pid";
named-xfer "/bin/named-xfer";
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Since this file is being read by the <CODE>named</CODE> daemon, all the paths are of
course relative to the chroot jail.
<P>Some people have also reported having to add an extra block to their
<CODE>named.conf</CODE> to get <CODE>ndc</CODE> working properly:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
controls {
    unix "/var/run/ndc" perm 0600 owner 0 group 0;
};
</PRE>
