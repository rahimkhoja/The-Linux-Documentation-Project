<LI>IRC is a package that supports receiving and sending IR signals of the most common IR remote controls. It contains a daemon
that decodes and sends IR signals, a mouse daemon that translates IR signals to mouse movements, and a couple of user
programs that allow to control your computer with a remote control.

<LI>Cajun is a program that allows you to turn any computer (>75mhz) into a massive audio jukebox for your car or home. It uses the
matrix-orbital serial display and supports the IRman infra-red remote control interface. Soundcard output is delivered to your (car
or home) stereo for amplification. The software supports a hotlist and shuffle mode.

<LI>IRMP3 is a multimedia audio jukebox for Linux. IRMP3's strength is that it easily integrates into home, car, and mobile
environments (where a keyboard/screen interface may not always be available). It supports several input and display devices
such as infrared remote controls, LCD displays, network connections, and serial keypads. It includes a robust set of tools like
alarms, sound environments, mixers, sleep functions, and more. It supports MP3 players and network-ready control &amp; status
monitoring, and includes a flexible, modularized source which allows functionality to be easily extended with user-developed
code.
