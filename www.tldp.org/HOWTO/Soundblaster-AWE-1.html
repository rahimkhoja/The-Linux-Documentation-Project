<P>
<P>This is the Sound Blaster AWE HOWTO. It gives you detailed information about
getting the most out of your Sound Blaster 32 or better, including Wave
Table synthesis. This document covers all SB cards up from the SB 32.
<P>The Sound Blaster series is well-known in the DOS and Windows community, and
a lot of Linux users want to use this sound card under Linux as well.
Unfortunately, Creative Labs only provides a sound driver for Windows and
DOS, so it is not trivial to install and use a SB card under Linux. This
document tries to describe how one can use the features of the SB AWE series
under a Linux environment.

<P>This documents contains information I got from the AWE Driver FAQ and the ISA PnP FAQ.
See section 
<A HREF="Soundblaster-AWE-6.html#sources">Sources</A> for author and location of this
documents. Thanks to the authors, the SB AWE support is possible.
<P>A lot of essential work was done by 
<A HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/usslite">Hannu Savolainen</A>, who developed the sound driver
that comes with the Linux kernel. Thank you!
<P>I want to thank 
<A HREF="mailto:n.bern@mail.protos.it">Nicola Bernardelli</A>
for testing the AWE64 stuff. Without
him, many errors would have remained undetected.
<P>Thanks to the 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/sgml-tools-0.99.0.tar.gz">SGML Tools</A> package, this HOWTO is available in several
