</P

>&#13;you can control the exact code behavior in critical sections that might
otherwise involve deadlock between multiple software threads or hardware
devices
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;you can break the conventions of your usual compiler, which might allow some
optimizations (like temporarily breaking rules about memory allocation,
threading, calling conventions, etc)
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;you can build interfaces between code fragments using incompatible conventions
(e.g. produced by different compilers, or separated by a low-level interface)
</P
></LI
><LI

>&#13;you can get access to unusual programming modes of your processor (e.g. 16 bit
mode to interface startup, firmware, or legacy code on Intel PCs)
</P

>&#13;you can produce reasonably fast code for tight loops to cope with a bad
non-optimizing compiler (but then, there are free optimizing compilers
available!)

hardware setup, though not to someone else's

something what very few ones will ever do, and even they not often)

instruction patterns). This means

</P
></LI

><P
>&#13;the result is non-portable to other architectures, existing or upcoming
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;your code will be optimized only for a certain implementation of a same
architecture: for instance, among Intel-compatible platforms each CPU design
and its variations (relative latency, through-output, and capacity, of
processing units, caches, RAM, bus, disks, presence of FPU, MMX, 3DNOW, SIMD
extensions, etc) implies potentially completely different optimization
techniques. CPU designs already include: Intel 386, 486, Pentium, PPro, PII,
PIII, PIV; Cyrix 5x86, 6x86, M2; AMD K5, K6 (K6-2, K6-III), K7 (Athlon, Duron).
New designs keep popping up, so don't expect either this listing and your code
to be up-to-date.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;you spend more time on a few details and can't focus on small and large
algorithmic design, that are known to bring the largest part of the speed up
(e.g. you might spend some time building very fast list/array manipulation
primitives in assembly; only a hash table would have sped up your program much
more; or, in another context, a binary tree; or some high-level structure
distributed over a cluster of CPUs)
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;a small change in algorithmic design might completely invalidate all your
existing assembly code. So that either you're ready (and able) to rewrite it
all, or you're tied to a particular algorithmic design
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;On code that ain't too far from what's in standard benchmarks, commercial
optimizing compilers outperform hand-coded assembly (well, that's less true on
the x86 architecture than on RISC architectures, and perhaps less true for
widely available/free compilers; anyway, for typical C code, GCC is fairly
good);

comp.compilers,

>2.1.3. Assessment</H2
><P
>&#13;All in all, you might find that though using assembly is sometimes needed, and
might even be useful in a few cases where it is not, you'll want to:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;minimize use of assembly code
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;encapsulate this code in well-defined interfaces
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;have your assembly code automatically generated from patterns expressed in a
higher-level language than assembly (e.g. GCC inline assembly macros)
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;have automatic tools translate these programs into assembly code
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;have this code be optimized if possible
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;All of the above, i.e. write (an extension to) an optimizing compiler back-end.
</P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>&#13;Even when assembly is needed (e.g. OS development), you'll find that not so
much of it is required, and that the above principles retain.
</P
><P
>&#13;See the Linux kernel sources concerning this: as little assembly as needed,
resulting in a fast, reliable, portable, maintainable OS. Even a successful
game like DOOM was almost massively written in C, with a tiny part only being
written in assembly for speed up.
