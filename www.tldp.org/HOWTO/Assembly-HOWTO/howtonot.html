>2.2.2. Languages with optimizing compilers</H2
><P
>&#13;Languages like ObjectiveCAML, SML, CommonLISP, Scheme, ADA, Pascal, C, C++,
among others, all have free optimizing compilers that will optimize the bulk
of your programs, and often do better than hand-coded assembly even for tight
loops, while allowing you to focus on higher-level details, and without
forbidding you to grab a few percent of extra performance in the
above-mentioned way, once you've reached a stable design. Of course, there are
also commercial optimizing compilers for most of these languages, too!
</P
><P
>&#13;Some languages have compilers that produce C code, which can be further
optimized by a C compiler: LISP, Scheme, Perl, and many other. Speed is fairly
good.

>2.2.3. General procedure to speed your code up</H2
><P
>&#13;As for speeding code up, you should do it only for parts of a program that a
profiling tool has consistently identified as being a performance bottleneck.
</P
><P
>&#13;Hence, if you identify some code portion as being too slow, you should
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;first try to use a better algorithm;
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;then try to compile it rather than interpret it;
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;then try to enable and tweak optimization from your compiler;
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;then give the compiler hints about how to optimize (typing information in LISP;
register usage with GCC; lots of options in most compilers, etc).
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;then possibly fallback to assembly programming
</P
></LI
></UL

</P
><P
>&#13;Finally, before you end up writing assembly, you should inspect generated code,
to check that the problem really is with bad code generation, as this might
really not be the case: compiler-generated code might be better than what you'd
have written, particularly on modern multi-pipelined architectures! Slow parts
of a program might be intrinsically so. The biggest problems on modern
architectures with fast processors are due to delays from memory access,
cache-misses, TLB-misses, and page-faults; register optimization becomes
useless, and you'll more profitably re-think data structures and threading
to achieve better locality in memory access. Perhaps a completely different
approach to the problem might help, then.

>2.2.4. Inspecting compiler-generated code</H2
><P
>&#13;There are many reasons to inspect compiler-generated assembly code. Here is
what you'll do with such code:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;check whether generated code can be obviously enhanced with hand-coded assembly
(or by tweaking compiler switches)
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;when that's the case, start from generated code and modify it instead of
starting from scratch
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;more generally, use generated code as stubs to modify, which at least gets
right the way your assembly routines interface to the external world
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;track down bugs in your compiler (hopefully the rarer)
</P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>&#13;The standard way to have assembly code be generated is to invoke your compiler
with the <TT
CLASS="option"
>-S</TT
> flag. This works with most Unix compilers,
including the GNU C Compiler (GCC), but YMMV. As for GCC, it will produce more
understandable assembly code with the <TT
CLASS="option"
>-fverbose-asm</TT
> command-line
option. Of course, if you want to get good assembly code, don't forget your usual
optimization options and hints!
