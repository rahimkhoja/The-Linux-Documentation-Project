<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA or
``PC Card'' support package.  It includes a set of loadable
kernel modules that implement a version of the Card Services
applications program interface, a set of client drivers for specific
cards, and a card manager daemon that can respond to card insertion
and removal events, loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It
supports ``hot swapping'' of most card types, so cards can be safely
inserted and ejected at any time.
<P>This software is a work in progress.  It contains bugs, and should be
used with caution.  I'll do my best to fix problems that are reported
to me, but if you don't tell me, I may never know.  If you use this
code, I hope you will send me your experiences, good or bad!
<P>If you have any suggestions for how this document could be improved,
please let me know (<CODE>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What is the latest version, and where can I get it?</A>
</H2>

<P>The current major release of Card Services is version 3.2, and minor
updates or bug fixes are numbered 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so on.
<P>Source code for the latest version is available on the web at
<A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net">http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net</A>, as
<CODE>pcmcia-cs-3.2.?.tar.gz</CODE>.  You may find more than one release
number here.  It is up to you to decide which version is more
appropriate, but the <CODE>CHANGES</CODE> file will summarize the most
important differences.
<P>Pre-compiled drivers are included with current releases of essentially
all major Linux distributions, including Slackware, Debian, Red Hat,
Caldera, and SuSE, among others.  So generally there is no need to
compile the drivers from scratch.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What systems are supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>This package should run on almost Intel-based Linux-capable laptop.
It also runs on some Alpha, PowerPC, ARM, and MIPS platforms.  Most
common socket controllers are supported.  Card docks for desktop
systems should work as long as they use a supported controller, and
are plugged directly into the ISA or PCI bus, as opposed to
SCSI-to-PCMCIA or IDE-to-PCMCIA adapters.  The following controllers
are recognized by the supplied socket drivers:

<P>Other controllers that are register compatible with the Intel i82365sl
will generally work, as well.
<P>Due to the rapid pace of technological change for laptop hardware, new
controllers appear frequently, and there may be delays between when a
new model appears on the market, and when driver support becomes
available.
<P>Support for Toshiba's ToPIC bridges was hindered for a long time by a
lack of sufficiently detailed technical documentation.  While some
datasheets have been available, a few idiosyncracies of the ToPIC
chips were not adequately explained.  Toshiba has given some direct
technical help on some of these issues, and I think the major ones
have been resolved.  However, with the introduction of kernel PCMCIA
support in 2.4.* and later kernels, some new Toshiba bugs may have
cropped up in the new socket driver code.
<P>The Motorola 6AHC05GA controller used in some Hyundai laptops is not
supported.  The custom host controller in the HP Omnibook 600 is
also unsupported.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What cards are supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>The current release includes drivers for a variety of ethernet cards,
a driver for modem and serial port cards, several SCSI adapter
drivers, a driver for ATA/IDE drive cards, and memory card drivers
that should support most SRAM cards and some flash cards.  The
<CODE>SUPPORTED.CARDS</CODE> file included with each release of Card Services
lists all cards that are known to work in at least one actual system.
<P>The likelihood that a card not on the supported list will work depends
on the type of card.  Essentially all modems should work with the
supplied driver.  Some network cards may work if they are OEM versions
of supported cards.  Other types of IO cards (frame buffers, sound
cards, etc) will not work until someone writes the appropriate
drivers.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 When will my favorite (unsupported) card become supported?</A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, they usually don't pay me to write device drivers, so
if you would like to have a driver for your favorite card, you are
probably going to have to do at least some of the work.  Ideally, I'd
like to work towards a model like the Linux kernel, where I would be
responsible mainly for the ``core'' driver code and other authors
would contribute and maintain client drivers for specific cards.  The
<CODE>SUPPORTED.CARDS</CODE> file mentions some cards for which driver work is
currently in progress.  I will try to help where I can, but be warned
that debugging kernel device drivers by email is not particularly
effective.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 Mailing lists and other information sources</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux PCMCIA information page is at
<A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net">http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net</A>, and has bug tracking,
support and feature requests, and a variety of PCMCIA related message
forums.  Users can request email notification of new responses to
particular questions, or notification for all new messages in a given
category.  I hope that this will become a useful repository of
information, for questions that go beyond the scope of the HOWTO.
<P>The Linux Laptop Page at 
<A HREF="http://www.linux-on-laptops.com">http://www.linux-on-laptops.com</A>
has links to a vast number of sites that have information about
configuring specific types of laptops for Linux.  There is also a
searchable database of system configuration information, and pointers
to a variety of laptop-related mailing lists.
