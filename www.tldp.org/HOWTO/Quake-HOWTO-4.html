</H2>


<P>Quake has hundreds of user created levels - known variously as "mods", "total
conversions" or simply "maps".
To run new maps, place the bsp file into the "quake/id1/maps"
subdirectory, and start Quake with the <B>+map MAPNAME</B> option.</P>
<P>Installing mods is simply a matter of creating a subdirectory DIR and
extracting the contents of the mod zipfile/tarball into this directory.
It is then loaded by using the <B>-game DIR</B> command line option and,
sometimes, <B>+map MAPNAME</B> where MAPNAME is the mod's start map. </P>
<P>For both maps and mods, all files should be in 
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-8.html#lowercase_">lowercase</A>.</P>

<P>There has recently been an effort to archive many Quake maps at Quaddicted.

<P>Some of the more notable mods are:</P>

<DL>

<DT><B>Travail</B><DD><P>This recent mod is a must have. It includes 15 single
player levels, stunning bosses, and a couple of twisting spider infested
caverns. Distrans has also contributed a professional quality
<A HREF="http://www.quaddicted.com/filebase/travail_soundtrack.zip">soundtrack</A>
composed of moody and interesting electronic vibes.

<DT><B>Quoth</B><DD><P>Quoth began life as a sequel to the draw-dropping mod,
<A HREF="http://kell.spawnpoint.org/convoked.html">Contract Revoked</A>, but has
recently gained much support from mappers, as is becoming the defacto extension of Quake I.</P>
<P>It's new features include numerous crazy enemies with strong AI, destructable environments,
and other items including ladders and flashlights.

<DT><B>W a r p s p a s m</B><DD><P>A huge atmospheric Quoth mod by Ijed. The latest and greatest.

<A NAME="soe_"></A> </P>
<DT><B>Soul of Evil</B><DD><P>Gorgeous medieval themed mod with two single player
episodes, a melee style arena mode and nice documentation.  Many thanks to
Tronwyn, Fat Controller and their co-authors.

<P>
<A NAME="nehahra_"></A> </P>
<DT><B>Nehahra</B><DD><P>Epic. Ambitious. Otherwordly.
Nehahra is the definitive Quake mod, supported in Linux by LordHavoc's
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-3.html#darkplaces_">Darkplaces</A>, and 
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-3.html#qudos_">QuDos</A>'
port of the NehQuake engine. It has some great models and maps, uses fog effects well, and has an
(optional) two hour movie/demo which ties-in well with the original Quake
"story-line" but is also in desperate need of an edit.</P>
<P>Nehahra also features improved enemy AI - the grunts strafe behind cover, and
scrags in open space can be very hard to pin down. New gamers may wish to
disable this feature by typing <B>nomonsters 1</B> at the game console.

<DT><B>Zerstörer</B><DD><P>Dark and bloody, with Doom's paranoiac atmosphere. A classic.
Zerstörer also has some good death match levels -

<DT><B>Neil Manke's mods</B><DD><P>Neil wrote the definitive Half-Life mod "They Hunger".
The quality and fun is in these maps too -

<DT><B>Operation: Urth Majik</B><DD><P>Oum is one of the few Quake 1 mods with a sci-fi feel. It has five well made
levels, with cut-scenes and many new weapons -
