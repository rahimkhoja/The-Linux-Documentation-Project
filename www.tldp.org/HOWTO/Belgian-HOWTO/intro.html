>1.1. Why this document?</H2
><P
>&#13;Since there was no information anywhere on the net for Belgian Linux
users around 1998, we started to collect stuff that we thought could
be important.
This HOWTO aims to be the definitive list of all Belgian-related Linux
information. If you think not, you have no excuse to complain and
certainly not to not contribute. ;)

>1.5. The Linux.be-domain debacle</H2
><P
>&#13;As you might have heard, Belgium also has its problem with the Linux.be
domain. Similar to the Linux.nl case. Around March 1999, someone tricked
the DNS administration about the trademark 'Linux' in Belgium by using
'Linux' as a commercial representation of the company ('uithangbord')
which was according to the rules of the DNS administration at that time.
The company in fact was one that sold motor-parts and the registration was
done with a fake fax containing a penguin.
			</P
><P
>&#13;It is sad that the person who registered the Linux.be-domain name,
did this behind the back of some Open Source volunteers who
were planning to register a not-for-profit organisation to hold the domain
name to prevent any abuse.
			</P
><P
>&#13;Afterwards there were several meetings with this person to work out an
agreement so that the domain was not used for commercial purposes and
handed over to a neutral organisation. But after several attempts it
was very clear that the owner wanted full control over the domain, which
he later emphasized by 'handing it over' to his own not-for-profit
organisation. He stated several times he wanted to keep the right to add
advertissements to the website, but wouldn't mind that volunteers added
content to the site (that was empty at the time). After this, no one was
willing to work voluntarily for the content of the site. Sadly he managed
to get some people volunteer for it after all.

appreciate if you mailed us the improvements. Since we're just human
this document isn't bug-free, but your contribution can and will make
a difference.
