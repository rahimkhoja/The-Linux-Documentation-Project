><P
>These are the orignal acknowledgments documented by Michael De La Rue. They have been included in their entirety to 
      ensure that each persons efforts to make Linux more accessibile are acknowledged.</P
><P
>Much of this document was created from various information sources
      on the Internet, many found from Yahoo and DEC's Alta Vista Search
      engine.  Included in this was the documentation of most of the
      software packages mentioned in the text.  Some information was also
      gleaned from the Royal National Institute for the Blind's help sheets.</P
><P
>T.V. Raman, the author of Emacspeak has reliably contributed comments,
      information and text as well as putting me in touch with other people
      who he knew on the Internet.</P
><P
>Kenneth Albanowski <A
HREF="mailto:kjahds@kjahds.com"
TARGET="_top"
>kjahds@kjahds.com</A
> provided the
     patch needed for the Brailloterm and information about it.</P
><P
>Roland Dyroff of <A

>S.u.S.E. GmbH</A
> 
      (Linux distributors and makers of S.u.S.E. Linux (English/German)) looked up
      KTS Stolper GmbH at my request and got some hardware details and
      information on the Brailloterm.</P
><P
>The most major and careful checks over of this document were done by
      James Bowden, <A
HREF="mailto:jrbowden@bcs.org.uk"

>jrbowden@bcs.org </A
> 
      and Nikhil Nair <A
HREF="mailto:nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk"
TARGET="_top"
>nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk</A
>, the
      BRLTTY authors who suggested a large number of corrections as well as extra information 
      for some topics.</P
><P
>The contributors to the blinux and linux-access mailing lists have
      contributed to this document by providng information for me to read.</P
><P
>Mark E. Novak of the Trace R and D centre <A
HREF="http://trace.wisc.edu/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://trace.wisc.edu/</A
>
      pointed me in the direction of several packages of software and information which I had not seen before.  He
      also made some comments on the structure of the document which I have
      partially taken into account and should probably do more about.</P
><P
>Other contributors include Nicolas Pitrie and Stephane Doyon.</P
><P
>A number of other people have contributed comments and information.
      Specific contributions are acknowledged within the document.</P
><P
>This version was specifically produced for <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;      RedHat</A
>'s Dr. Linux book.  This is
      because they provided warning of it's impending release to myself and
      other LDP authors.  Their doing this is strongly appreciated since
      wrong or old information sits around much longer in a book than on the
      Internet.</P
><P
>No doubt you made a contribution and I haven't mentioned it.  Don't
      worry, it was an accident.  I'm sorry.  Just tell me and I will add
      you to the next version.</P
