<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Installing the Operating Systems</A></H2>

<P>When you install the OSes, make sure that all are installed on bootable
partitions.  I installed both Windows 95 and Windows NT on Fat 16
partitions, so this procedure works on Fat 16 drives.  If you decide to
use Fat32 for Windows 95 and NTFS for Windows NT, check to see if your
version of Linux supports them and, if so, to what extent.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Installing Windows 95</A>
</H2>

<P>Install Windows 95 on your first drive.  This will be your C: drive.
Remember to create the Windows 95 boot floppies when prompted to do so.
<P>I have found that it is better if the Linux drive is removed from the
system when installing Windows 95, so that it is never detected and it
doesn't exist as far as Windows 95 is concerned.
<P>At this point, if you did everything correctly, you should be able to
boot Windows 95.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Installing Windows NT 4.0</H3>

<P>Install Windows NT 4.0 on your second drive.  When you create the
partition on this drive, make the partition bootable.  Not all versions
of Linux support NTFS, so I created a FAT16 partition, just to be on the
safe side and because I wanted to exchange data between the Windows
drives.
<P>When Windows NT installs, it will detect the presence of Windows 95 and
will create an entry for it in the NT OS loader and you should see three
entries in the OS loader menu as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Windows NT Workstation Version 4.00
Windows NT Workstation Version 4.00 [VGA mode]
Microsoft Windows
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At this point, if you did everything correctly, you should be able to
multiboot to Windows NT and Windows 95.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Installing Linux</H3>

<P>Install Linux on your third drive.  When I installed Linux, I only had
Windows 95 installed so I only added the Windows 95 partition to Lilo.
You can go ahead and install all OSes while installing LILO, or edit the
Lilo configuration file later.  However you decide to do it, I will show
you how the /etc/lilo.conf file is supposed to look in the next section.
Once Linux is installed, you should be able to boot to Linux.
