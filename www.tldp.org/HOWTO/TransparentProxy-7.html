<P>Warning, this is really esoteric stuff.  If you need it, you'll know.  If
not, skip this section.  Thanks to Lewis Shobbrook (lshobbrook@fasttrack.net.au) for contributing to this section.
<P>If you are trying to setup a transparent proxy on a Linux machine that has
been configured as a bridge, you will need to add one additional iptables 
command to what we had in section 5.
Specifically, you need to explicitly allow connections to the machine
on port 3128 (or any other port squid is listening on), otherwise the 
machine will just forward them over to the other interface like a good 
little bridge.  Here's the magic words:
<UL>
<LI>iptables -A INPUT -i <B>interface</B> -p tcp -d <B>your_bridge_ip</B> -s <B>local-network</B> --dport 3128 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT</LI>
</UL>

Replacing <B>interface</B> with the interface that corresponds to
<B>your_bridge_ip</B> (typically eth0 or eth1).  First time bridge users 
should also note that you'll probably want to repeat the same command with
``3128'' replaced by ``telnet'' if you want to administer your bridge
remotely.
