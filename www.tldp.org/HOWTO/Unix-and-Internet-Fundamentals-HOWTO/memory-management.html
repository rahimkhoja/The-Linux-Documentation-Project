>8. How does my computer keep processes from stepping on each other?</H1
><P
>The kernel's scheduler takes care of dividing processes in time.
Your operating system also has to divide them in space, so that processes
can't step on each others' working memory.  Even if you assume that all
programs are trying to be cooperative, you don't want a bug in one of them
to be able to corrupt others.  The things your operating system does to
solve this problem are called <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>memory
management</I
>.</P
><P
>Each process in your zoo needs its own area of memory, as a place to
run its code from and keep variables and results in.  You can think of this
set as consisting of a read-only <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>code
segment</I
>
(containing the process's instructions) and a writeable <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>data
segment</I
>
(containing all the process's variable storage).  The data segment is truly
unique to each process, but if two processes are running the same code Unix
automatically arranges for them to share a single code segment as an
efficiency measure.</P

>8.1. Virtual memory: the simple version</H2
><P
>Efficiency is important, because memory is expensive.  Sometimes you
don't have enough to hold the entirety of all the programs the machine is
running, especially if you are using a large program like an X server.  To
get around this, Unix uses a technique called <A
NAME="vm"
></A
>
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>virtual memory</I
>.  It doesn't try to hold all the code and data
for a process in memory.  Instead, it keeps around only a relatively small
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>working set</I
>; the rest of the process's state is left in a
special <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>swap space</I
> area on your hard disk.</P
><P
>Note that in the past, that <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Sometimes"</SPAN
> last paragraph ago was
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Almost always"</SPAN
> &#8212; the size of memory was typically small
relative to the size of running programs, so swapping was frequent.  Memory
is far less expensive nowadays and even low-end machines have quite a lot
of it.  On modern single-user machines with 64MB of memory and up, it's
possible to run X and a typical mix of jobs without ever swapping after
they're initially loaded into core.</P

>8.2. Virtual memory: the detailed version</H2
><P
>Actually, the last section oversimplified things a bit.  Yes,
programs see most of your memory as one big flat bank of addresses bigger
than physical memory, and disk swapping is used to maintain that illusion.
But your hardware actually has no fewer than five different kinds of memory
in it, and the differences between them can matter a good deal when
programs have to be tuned for maximum speed.  To really understand what
goes on in your machine, you should learn how all of them work.</P
><P
>The five kinds of memory are these: processor registers, internal (or
on-chip) cache, external (or off-chip) cache, main memory, and disk.  And
the reason there are so many kinds is simple: speed costs money. I have
listed these kinds of memory in increasing order of access time and
decreasing order of cost.  Register memory is the fastest and most
expensive and can be random-accessed about a billion times a second, while
disk is the slowest and cheapest and can do about 100 random accesses a
second.</P
><P
>Here's a full list reflecting early-2000 speeds for a typical desktop
machine. While speed and capacity will go up and prices will drop, you can
expect these ratios to remain fairly constant &#8212; and it's those ratios that
shape the memory hierarchy.</P

>We can't build everything out of the fastest kinds of memory.  It
would be way too expensive &#8212; and even if it weren't, fast memory is
volatile.  That is, it loses its marbles when the power goes off.  Thus,
computers have to have hard disks or other kinds of non-volatile storage
that retains data when the power goes off.  And there's a huge mismatch
between the speed of processors and the speed of disks. The middle three
levels of the memory hierarchy (<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>internal
cache</I
>, <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>external
cache</I
>, and main memory) basically exist to bridge
that gap.</P
><P
>Linux and other Unixes have a feature called <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>virtual
memory</I
>.
What this means is that the operating system behaves as though it has much
more main memory than it actually does.  Your actual physical main memory
behaves like a set of windows or caches on a much larger "virtual" memory
space, most of which at any given time is actually stored on disk in a
special zone called the <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>swap
area</I
>.  Out of
sight of user programs, the OS is moving blocks of data (called "pages")
between memory and disk to maintain this illusion.  The end result is that
your virtual memory is much larger but not too much slower than real
memory.</P
><P
>How much slower virtual memory is than physical depends on how well
the operating system's swapping algorithms match the way your programs use
virtual memory.  Fortunately, memory reads and writes that are close
together in time also tend to cluster in memory space. This tendency is
called
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>locality</I
>,
or more formally <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>locality of
reference</I
> &#8212; and it's a good thing.  If memory
references jumped around virtual space at random, you'd typically have to
do a disk read and write for each new reference and virtual memory would be
as slow as a disk.  But because programs do actually exhibit strong
locality, your operating system can do relatively few swaps per
reference.</P
><P
>It's been found by experience that the most effective method for a
broad class of memory-usage patterns is very simple; it's called LRU or the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"least recently used"</SPAN
> algorithm.  The virtual-memory system grabs disk
blocks into its <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>working
set</I
> as it
needs them.  When it runs out of physical memory for the working set, it
dumps the least-recently-used block.  All Unixes, and most other
virtual-memory operating systems, use minor variations on LRU.</P
><P
>Virtual memory is the first link in the bridge between disk and
processor speeds.  It's explicitly managed by the OS.  But there is still a
major gap between the speed of physical main memory and the speed at which
a processor can access its register memory.  The external and internal
caches address this, using a technique similar to virtual memory as I've
described it.</P
><P
>Just as the physical main memory behaves like a set of windows or
caches on the disk's swap area, the external cache acts as windows on main
memory.  External cache is faster (250M accesses per sec, rather than 100M)
and smaller.  The hardware (specifically, your computer's memory
controller) does the LRU thing in the external cache on blocks of data
fetched from the main memory.  For historical reasons, the unit of cache
swapping is called a <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>line</I
> rather than a page.</P
><P
>But we're not done.  The internal cache gives us the final step-up in
effective speed by caching portions of the external cache.  It is faster
and smaller yet &#8212; in fact, it lives right on the processor chip.</P
><P
>If you want to make your programs really fast, it's useful to know
these details.  Your programs get faster when they have stronger locality,
because that makes the caching work better.  The easiest way to make
programs fast is therefore to make them small.  If a program isn't slowed
down by lots of disk I/O or waits on network events, it will usually run at
the speed of the smallest cache that it will fit inside.</P
><P
>If you can't make your whole program small, some effort to tune the
speed-critical portions so they have stronger locality can pay off.
Details on techniques for doing such tuning are beyond the scope of this
tutorial; by the time you need them, you'll be intimate enough with some
compiler to figure out many of them yourself.</P

>8.3. The Memory Management Unit</H2
><P
>Even when you have enough physical core to avoid swapping, the part
of the operating system called the <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>memory manager</I
>
still has important work to do.  It has to make sure that programs can only
alter their own data segments &#8212; that is, prevent erroneous or malicious
code in one program from garbaging the data in another.  To do this, it
keeps a table of data and code segments.  The table is updated whenever a
process either requests more memory or releases memory (the latter usually
when it exits).</P
><P
>This table is used to pass commands to a specialized part of the
underlying hardware called an
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>MMU</I
> or
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>memory management unit</I
>.  Modern processor chips have MMUs
built right onto them.  The MMU has the special ability to put fences
around areas of memory, so an out-of-bound reference will be refused and
cause a special interrupt to be raised.</P
><P
>If you ever see a Unix message that says <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Segmentation fault"</SPAN
>,
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"core dumped"</SPAN
> or something similar, this is exactly what has happened;
an attempt by the running program to access memory (core) outside its
segment has raised a fatal interrupt.  This indicates a bug in the program
code; the <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>core dump</I
> it leaves behind is diagnostic information
intended to help a programmer track it down.</P
><P
>There is another aspect to protecting processes from each other besides
segregating the memory they access.  You also want to be able to control
their file accesses so a buggy or malicious program can't corrupt critical
pieces of the system.  This is why Unix has <A
HREF="disk-layout.html#permissions"
>&#13;file permissions</A
> which we'll discuss later.</P
