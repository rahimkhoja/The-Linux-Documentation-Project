>7. How does my computer do several things at once?</H1
><P
>It doesn't, actually.  Computers can only do one task (or
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>process</I
>) at a time.  But a computer can change tasks
very rapidly, and fool slow human beings into thinking it's doing several
things at once.  This is called
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>timesharing</I
>.</P
><P
>One of the kernel's jobs is to manage timesharing.  It has a part
called the
<I
CLASS="firstterm"
>scheduler</I
>
which keeps information inside itself about all the other (non-kernel)
processes in your zoo.  Every 1/60th of a second, a timer goes off in the
kernel, generating a clock interrupt.  The scheduler stops whatever process
is currently running, suspends it in place, and hands control to another
process.</P
><P
>1/60th of a second may not sound like a lot of time.  But on today's
microprocessors it's enough to run tens of thousands of machine
instructions, which can do a great deal of work.  So even if you have many
processes, each one can accomplish quite a bit in each of its
timeslices.</P
><P
>In practice, a program may not get its entire timeslice. If an
interrupt comes in from an I/O device, the kernel effectively stops the
current task, runs the interrupt handler, and then returns to the current
task.  A storm of high-priority interrupts can squeeze out normal
processing; this misbehavior is called <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>thrashing</I
> and
is fortunately very hard to induce under modern Unixes.</P
><P
>In fact, the speed of programs is only very seldom limited by the
amount of machine time they can get (there are a few exceptions to this
rule, such as sound or 3-D graphics generation).  Much more often, delays
are caused when the program has to wait on data from a disk drive or
network connection.</P
><P
>An operating system that can routinely support many simultaneous
processes is called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"multitasking"</SPAN
>.  The Unix family of operating
systems was designed from the ground up for multitasking and is very good
at it &#8212; much more effective than Windows or the old Mac OS, which both
had multitasking bolted into them as an afterthought and do it rather poorly.
Efficient, reliable multitasking is a large part of what makes Linux
superior for networking, communications, and Web service.</P
