<H2><A NAME="s8">8. RCS and <CODE>emacs(1)</CODE> Version Control.</A></H2>

<P>The Version Control facility of <CODE>emacs(1)</CODE> works as a front end
to RCS.  This information applies specifically to Version 19.34 of GNU
Emacs, which is provided with the major Linux distributions.  When
editing a file with <CODE>emacs(1)</CODE> which is registered with RCS,
the command <CODE>vc-toggle-read-only</CODE> (bound to <CODE>C-x C-q</CODE> by
default) will check a file in to the emacs's Version Control, and then
into RCS.  Emacs will open a buffer where you can type a log message
to be included in the RCS log.  When you are finished typing a log
entry, type <CODE>C-c C-c</CODE> to terminate your input and proceed with
the check-in process.
<P>If you have selected strict locking for the file with RCS, you must
re-lock the file for editing by <CODE>emacs(1)</CODE>.  You can check the
file out for emacs's Version Control with the command <CODE>%</CODE> in
buffer-menu mode.
<P>For more information, see the GNU Emacs Manual and the Emacs info pages.
