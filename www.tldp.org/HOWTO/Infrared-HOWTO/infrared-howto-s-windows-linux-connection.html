>&#13;   Why this? Unfortunately Linux users are not always supplied with the
   necessary hardware information. Sometimes it is possible to look at
   this information in Microsoft-Windows. Sometimes its even useful to connect
   the two. Linux could also provide occasional access point services to
   a Microsoft-Windows laptop of a friend dropping by.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Where to get it from? At 
   <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>MicroSoft</A
>
   in the directory 
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/Windows95/downloads/contents/WURecommended/S_WUCommunications/W95IrDA/</TT
>
   you will find a support pack Infrared Transfer 2.0. It is a
   self-extracting archive W95IR.EXE with 331KB. Note: Microsoft seems to
   change the location of this file (and others) at random, the former
   URL is Microsoft Windows95 IrDA - Old
</P
><P
>&#13;   Microsoft(tm) has three versions of IrDA support for Windows95. The
   version number can be found in the "Software" icon in the Control
   Panel and the file <TT
CLASS="filename"
>infrared.inf</TT
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Version 1.0 is still delivered with some hardware.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Version 2.0 is the version they currently offer at their web site. It
   is in the self-extracting file <B
CLASS="command"
>W95IR.EXE</B
>. The last time I looked
   (1999-02-21) it was 434KB and was found at
   http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/W95IR.EXE the link
   is dead now.
   
   Their website is frequently changing, so do not be surprised to find
   the file (also) in another location or not at all.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Version 3.0 can/could be found in their downloadable Infrared
   development kit IRDDK30, but is mostly useful for developers. It is
   internally different from 2.0, it is based on "miniport" network
   drivers, just like the Linux version. It exists for some time and has
   some support for NT, but it clearly did not make it into the
   mainstream NT4.0 distributions. For 95 you are probably better off
   with 2.0. The choice may depend on the documentation of the drivers
   you get with your specific hardware.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The Microsoft website also used to contain a nice utility IrXfer, contained in
   the archive <B
CLASS="command"
>IRXFER.EXE</B
>, This is the Infrared Transfer utility, which
   uses an IrOBEX variant I think, it is referenced in the IrOBEX
   protocol description. The utility was freely downloadable, but I could
   not find it the last time. It is a nice graphical utility which can be
   used to transfer files over IrDA between computers.
</P
><P
>&#13;   With some machines, e.g. a HP Omnibook 800 it is necessary to use a
   vendor specific version of this package (for the HP Omnibook 800 you
   may find it on the recovery CD).
</P
><P
>&#13;   Especially the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>..\windows\inf\*.inf</TT
> files and the device manager are
   of interest to look for configuration details.
</P
><P
>&#13;   As far as I know Window$NT doesn't support IrDA(TM). About Window$98 I
   have heard there is no IrDA(TM) support yet.

   claims to sell an IrDA solution for NT4.0 to
   support their JetBeam product, Microsoft refers to them for it.

   is a driver by Jan Kiszka for Windows 2000 and XP. It emulates a serial port
   which can be used to exchange data with mobile devices. For example,
   some cellular phones are able to act as modems or fax devices. PDAs with
   infrared interface can be synchronized with the PC.
   IrCOMM2k is an Open Source project according
   to the terms of the GPL.
