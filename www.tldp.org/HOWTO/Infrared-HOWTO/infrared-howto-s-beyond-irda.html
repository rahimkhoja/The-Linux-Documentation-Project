>&#13;   According to the IrDA specification the range is up to 1 meter. From
   the "IrDA Data Link Design Guide" p. 20 by

   : " In some cases it may be desired to
   increase link distance beyond the 1 meter guaranteed by IrDA. The two
   ways to do this are to increase transmitted light intensity, or to
   increase receiver sensitivity. In order to extend the link distance,
   both sensitivity and intensity must be increased for both ends of the
   IR link. If it is desired to communicate with a standard IrDA device
   that may have minimum transmitter intensity, the receiver intensity
   must be increased. The standard IrDA device may also have minimum
   receiver sensitivity, so transmitter intensity must also be
   increased."

   idea whether the whole IrDA stack really relies on a two-way
   connection, or whether there are some parts of it that could be abused
   for a one-way connection, ideally for unreliable data? We're trying to
   modify some IR dongles to broadcast information to palm pilots over
   several meters distance (cover a whole room), and since we don't want
   to modify the pilots themselves, and increasing the sensitivity on the
   receiver side seems unlikely to work, we're stuck with a one way
   link.". Please see the mailing list archive for details of the
   discussion.

   This is supposed to be bi-directional, 75 kbps data rate, multiple

>"The main problem is that you generally have to
   make the receiver more sensitive. Basic physics has the inverse square
   law: the intensity drops with the SQUARE of the distance, so going
   from 1 to 5 meters requires 25x the power (and battery drain on a
   portable device), or 25x the sensitivity (and dynamic range - it still
   has to be able to work at 3 inches). And if you want to do it on the
   other end, it doesn't simply have to be 25x more sensitive, it must
   pick up the tiny IrDA pulse needle in a haystack of florescent lights,
   screen savers, moving shadows ..."</SPAN

>&#13;   Also laser diodes (pulsable) were recommended by K-H. Eischer: But they
   are more expensive. And the laser diodes are also dangerous if they
   have more than 1 mW. A better solution would be to use lenses to focus
   the beam. There is a minimum of absorbtion in the air (I don't know
   the right frequency) and you should use IR diodes with this frequency.

   Steve Carcia had a series on articles on modulating He-Ne lasers

>&#13;   "More and more people now think that IrDA and Bluetooth will live
   happily side by side, and the idea of Bluetooth as the IrDA killer
   just don't work anymore. IrDA is still unbeatable in price/performance
   and with the new additions to the standards family like AIR and VFIR,
   it's really good to see that IrDA is moving in the right direction."
