<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 A Wireless Linux distribution</A>
</H2>

<P>The wireless distribution FlyingLinux started in October 1999 in the Telecommunication
Systems Lab at Teleinformatics KTH with the objective of studying the possibilty
of using MobileIPv4 and standard DHCP-based wireless access for student labs.
<P>
<P>The result of that work was the FlyingLinux environment available for one
hundred students and teachers during the 2G1303 project course that was held
from March to May year 2000. 
<P>FlyingLinux is the first linux distribution oriented to mobility services.
We have taken care of the security issues including Kerberos support and OpenSSH.
<P>
<P>FlyingLinux is part of the Open Source movement. We have included software
that have been developed at KTH under the GPL licence. 
<P>You can find the Wireless Linux distribution at this
