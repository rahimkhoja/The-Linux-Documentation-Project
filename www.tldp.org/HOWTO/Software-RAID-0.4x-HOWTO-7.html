Are linear MD's expandable?
Can a new hard-drive/partition be added,
and the size of the existing file system expanded?

I changed the ext2fs code to be aware of multiple-devices
instead of the regular one device per file system assumption.

<P>So, when you want to extend a file system,
you run a utility program that makes the appropriate changes
on the new device (your extra partition) and then you just tell
the system to extend the fs using the specified device.
<P>
<P>You can extend a file system with new devices at system operation
time, no need to bring the system down
(and whenever I get some extra time, you will be able to remove
devices from the ext2 volume set, again without even having
to go to single-user mode or any hack like that).
<P>
<P>You can get the patch for 2.1.x kernel from my web page:

Can I add disks to a RAID-5 array?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Currently, (September 1997) no, not without erasing all
data. A conversion utility to allow this does not yet exist.  
The problem is that the actual structure and layout 
of a RAID-5 array depends on the number of disks in the array.

Of course, one can add drives by backing up the array to tape, 
deleting all data, creating a new array, and restoring from 
tape.

What would happen to my RAID1/RAID0 sets if I shift one
of the drives from being <CODE>/dev/hdb</CODE> to <CODE>/dev/hdc</CODE>?

Because of cabling/case size/stupidity issues, I had to 
make my RAID sets on the same IDE controller (<CODE>/dev/hda</CODE>
and <CODE>/dev/hdb</CODE>). Now that I've fixed some stuff, I want 
to move <CODE>/dev/hdb</CODE> to <CODE>/dev/hdc</CODE>.

What would happen if I just change the <CODE>/etc/mdtab</CODE> and 
<CODE>/etc/raid1.conf</CODE> files to reflect the new location?

For RAID-0/linear, one must be careful to specify the
drives in exactly the same order. Thus, in the above
example, if the original config is
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/hda /dev/hdb
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Then the new config *must* be
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/hda /dev/hdc
            
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


For RAID-1/4/5, the drive's ''RAID number'' is stored in
its RAID superblock, and therefore the order in which the
disks are specified is not important.

RAID-0/linear does not have a superblock due to it's older
design, and the desire to maintain backwards compatibility
with this older design.

Can I convert a two-disk RAID-1 mirror to a three-disk RAID-5 array?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Yes.  Michael at BizSystems has come up with a clever, 
sneaky way of doing this.  However, like virtually all
manipulations of RAID arrays once they have data on 
them, it is dangerous and prone to human error.  
<B>Make a backup before you start</B>.
<PRE>

I will make the following assumptions:
---------------------------------------------
disks 
original: hda - hdc
raid1 partitions hda3 - hdc3
array name /dev/md0

new hda - hdc - hdd
raid5 partitions hda3 - hdc3 - hdd3
array name: /dev/md1

You must substitute the appropriate disk and partition numbers for 
you system configuration. This will hold true for all config file 
examples.
--------------------------------------------
DO A BACKUP BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
1) recompile kernel to include both raid1 and raid5
2) install new kernel and verify that raid personalities are present
3) disable the redundant partition on the raid 1 array. If this is a
 root mounted partition (mine was) you must be more careful.

 Reboot the kernel without starting raid devices or boot from rescue 
 system ( raid tools must be available )

 start non-redundant raid1
mdadd -r -p1 /dev/md0 /dev/hda3

4) configure raid5 but with 'funny' config file, note that there is 
  no hda3 entry and hdc3 is repeated. This is needed since the
  raid tools don't want you to do this.
-------------------------------
# raid-5 configuration
raiddev                 /dev/md1
raid-level              5
nr-raid-disks           3
chunk-size              32

# Parity placement algorithm
parity-algorithm        left-symmetric

# Spare disks for hot reconstruction
nr-spare-disks          0

device                  /dev/hdc3
raid-disk               0

device                  /dev/hdc3
raid-disk               1

device                  /dev/hdd3
raid-disk               2
---------------------------------------
 mkraid /etc/raid5.conf
5) activate the raid5 array in non-redundant mode

mdadd -r -p5 -c32k /dev/md1 /dev/hdc3 /dev/hdd3

6) make a file system on the array

mke2fs -b {blocksize} /dev/md1

recommended blocksize by some is 4096 rather than the default 1024.
this improves the memory utilization for the kernel raid routines and 
matches the blocksize to the page size. I compromised and used 2048 
since I have a relatively high number of small files on my system.

7) mount the two raid devices somewhere

mount -t ext2 /dev/md0 mnt0
mount -t ext2 /dev/md1 mnt1

8) move the data

cp -a mnt0 mnt1

9) verify that the data sets are identical
10) stop both arrays
11) correct the information for the raid5.conf file
  change /dev/md1 to /dev/md0
  change the first disk to read /dev/hda3

12) upgrade the new array to full redundant status
 (THIS DESTROYS REMAINING raid1 INFORMATION)

ckraid --fix /etc/raid5.conf
