<P>This document is based on the work of many other people who have made it
possible for Linux to be what it is now: one of the best network operating
systems. All credit is theirs. A lot of effort has been put into this
document to make it simple but accurate and complete but not excessively
long. Nevertheless, no liability will be assumed by the author under any
circumstance. Use the information contained here at your own risk. Please
feel free to e-mail me suggestions, corrections or general comments about
the document so I can improve it. Other topics that will probably be
included in futures revisions of this document may include radius, web/ftp
mirroring tools such as wget, traffic analyzers, CORBA... and many others
that may be suggested and suitable. You can reach me at
