>The second biggest problem with DocBook is the effort needed to
convert old-style presentation markup to DocBook markup.  Human beings
can usually parse the presentation of a document into logical
structure automatically, because (for example) they can tell from 
context when an italic font means `emphasis' and when it means
something else such as `this is a foreign phrase'.</P
><P
>Somehow, in converting documents to DocBook, those
sorts of distinctions need to be made explicit.  Sometimes
they're present in the old markup; often they are not, and the
missing  structural information has to be either deduced by 
clever heuristics or added by a human.</P

various other formats:</P

support DocBook as an interchange format.  Texinfo has enough
structure to make reasonably good automatic conversion possible, and
the 4.x versions of <B

module that translates Plain Old Documentation markup to DocBook.  It
claims to translate every POD tag except the L&#60;&#62; italic tag.
The man page also says "Nested =over/=back lists are not supported
within DocBook." but notes that the module has been heavily
tested.</P

>LaTeX is a (mostly) structural markup macro language built on
top of the TeX formatter.  There is a project called <A

>This is generally considered the biggest and nastiest conversion
problem.  And indeed, the basic
<SPAN
CLASS="citerefentry"
><SPAN
CLASS="refentrytitle"
>troff</SPAN
>(1)</SPAN
> markup is at too low a presentation
level for automatic conversion tools to do much of any good.  However,
the gloom in the picture lightens significantly if we consider
translation from sources of documents written in macro packages like
<SPAN
CLASS="citerefentry"
><SPAN
CLASS="refentrytitle"
>man</SPAN

features for automatic translation to get some traction.</P

interesting).  It's called <A
