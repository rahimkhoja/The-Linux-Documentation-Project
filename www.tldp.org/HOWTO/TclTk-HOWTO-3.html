<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What is Tcl?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Tcl is the acronym for "Tool Command Language" (it is pronounced "tickle").
Tcl is actually divided into two things: a language and a library.
<P>Tcl is a simple textual programming language, intended for issuing commands
to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers and shells. It has
a simple syntax and it is also programmable.
<P>Tcl users can write command procedures to provide more powerful commands
than those given in the built-in set.
<P>Second, Tcl is a library package embeddable in applications. The Tcl library
consists of a parser for the Tcl language, routines to implement the Tcl built
-in
commands, and procedures which allow each application to extend Tcl with addit
ional
commands specific to that application. The application program generates Tcl
commands and passes them to the Tcl parser for execution.
<P>Commands may be generated by reading characters from an input source, or
by associating command strings with elements of the application's user interfa
ce,
such as menu entries, buttons, and other widgets. When the Tcl library receive
s
commands it parses them into component fields and executes built-in commands
directly.
<P>For commands implemented by the application, Tcl calls back to the application
to execute the commands. In many cases commands will make recursive invocation
s
of the Tcl interpreter by passing in additional strings to execute (in fact
procedures and conditional-looping commands all work in this way). An applicat
ion
program can obtain many advantages by using Tcl for its command language:
<UL>
<LI>Tcl provides a standard syntax: once users know Tcl, they will be able
to issue commands easily to any Tcl-based application.</LI>
<LI>Tcl succeeds to provides programmability. All a Tcl application needs to
do is to implement a few application-specific low-level commands. Tcl provides
many utility commands and a general programming interface for building up comp
lex
command procedures. By using Tcl, applications need not reimplement these feat
ures.
</LI>
<LI>Extensions to Tcl, such as the Tk toolkit, provide mechanisms for communi
cating
between applications by sending Tcl commands back and forth. The common Tcl
language framework makes it easier for applications to communicate with one
another.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is important to note that Tcl was designed thinking that the programmer
should actually use two or more languages when designing large software system
s.
One for manipulating complex internal data structures, or where performance
is important, and another, such as Tcl, for writing very small scripts that
glue together the other pieces, providing hooks for the user to extend.
<P>For the Tcl script writer, ease of learning, ease of programming and ease
of gluing are more important than performance or facilities for complex data
structures and algorithms.
<P>Tcl was designed to make it easy to drop into a lower language when you
come across tasks that make more sense at a lower level. In this way, the basi
c
core functionality can remain small and one need only bring along pieces that
one particular wants or needs.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 What is Tk?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Tk (pronounced "tee-kay") is an extension to Tcl which provides the programmer
with an interface to the X11 windowing system . Note that Tk has been successf
ully
compiled under X11 R4, X11 R5, X11 R6, as well as Sun's NeWS/X11 environments.
<P>
<P>Many users will encounter Tcl/Tk via the "wish" command. Wish is a simple
windowing shell which permits the user to write Tcl/Tk applications in a proto
typing
environment.
<P>At present Tcl/Tk cannot handle Japanese, Chinese, Korean, .... language
fonts.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Extensions</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Since Tcl is so easy to extend, many try to share extensions, including
the popular itcl, 
<A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com/itcl/">[incr Tcl]</A>,
ObjectTcl, TclX, 
<A HREF="http://tix.mne.com/">Tix </A>, and
<A HREF="http://www.tcltk.com/blt/">BLT</A>.
<P>These extensions, of course, require an extended Tcl interpreter. Moreover,
many Tcl free applications require a particular Tcl extension to run.
<P>One of the most popular extension is called
<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov">Expect</A>.
It allows you to place a
friendly front-end inside most command-line based UNIX applications, such as
ftp, telnet, rlogin, passwd, fsck, and so on.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Supported Platforms</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This section contains information about Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0, the most recent
version of Tcl/Tk. They were originally released on August 18, 1997 and the
most recent patch releases (8.0.3) were made on September 3, 1998.
<P>When you download Tcl and Tk you get two programs, wish and tclsh, supporting
script libraries, and on-line reference documentation. These programs are gene
ral
purpose platforms for writing applications with Tcl. Wish includes the graphic
al
user interface toolkit Tk. The packages are ready to use after installation.
<P>
<P>Tcl 8.0 and Tk 8.0 run on most releases of the following operating systems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows 95</LI>
<LI>Windows NT</LI>
<LI>Solaris and SunOS</LI>
<LI>Linux</LI>
<LI>HP-UX</LI>
<LI>SGI</LI>
<LI>IRIX</LI>
<LI>Digital Unix</LI>
<LI>AIX</LI>
<LI>SCO Unix</LI>
<LI>Most other Unix-like operating systems Macintosh (68K and Power Mac)</LI>
<LI>Pre-compiled releases are available for different Linux distribution.</LI>
