>This section is included unchanged from the original document. It's
clearly out of date, and I'm not sure if it's worth keeping in. It's a
bit offtopic for a Linux howto, and the effort of keeping it current
seems a bit pointless. Instead I've added a section detailing devices 
that use the Palm operating system, and which therefore should work with 
the instructions in this HOWTO.</P
><P
>There are two versions of
the Pilot.  They are the <EM
>1000</EM
> and the
<EM
>5000</EM
> and have 128k and 512k of RAM,
respectively. They come with Palm OS 1.0 in ROM.  </P
><P
>Then came two devices with the name <EM
>PalmPilot</EM
>.  They are the <EM
>PalmPilot Personal</EM
> and the <EM
>PalmPilot Professional</EM
> and have 512k and 1 Meg
of RAM, respectively.  They also have a backlighting feature for the
LCD panel and version 2.0 of the operating system.  The <EM
>Professional</EM
> also comes with a TCP/IP stack and
a few extra programs built-in.	</P
><P
>IBM has released a rebadged version of the PalmPilot Professional,
which they call a <EM
>WorkPad</EM
>.  </P
><P
>Now we have the Palm III, which has a redesigned case and an
infrared port, not to mention the 2 Meg of RAM and Palm OS 3.0.  </P
><P
>There is an announced product from Qualcomm, called the
<EM
>pdQ smartphone</EM
>, which is a cell phone
that incorporates a Palm OS PDA.  Don't get all excited about it yet,
it will not be released until sometime in 1999.  </P
><P
>It is possible to upgrade any Pilot by swapping out the memory
card, which includes both RAM &#38; ROM.  Of course, this doesn't get
you backlighting for the original Pilot series.  </P
