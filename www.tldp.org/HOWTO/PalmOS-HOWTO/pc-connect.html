NAME="PC-CONNECT">2. Connecting to the PC</H1
><P
>The first step to getting your PDA running under Linux is to connect it
to your PC. Until recently, all PalmOS devices connected via a serial
cable. The latest devices use USB, and some can also connect via infrared.</P
><P
>Another development allows the PDA to physically connect to one
machine on the network and synchronise remotely with another machine.</P

NAME="PC-CONNECT-SERIAL">2.1. Serial Connection</H2
><P
>The serial connection is currently the easiest way to connect
your PDA to your PC. Simply connect the cradle to a serial port,
then refer to that port when using coldsync or the pilot-link
suite. The serial connection is slow, but has the advantage of
being tried and tested. It should work with any Palm OS device for
which a serial cable is available. Serial cradles and cables are
available as accessories for the Palm PDAs, including those which
come with USB cradles as standard.</P
><P
>For convenience, you may wish
to create a device called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/pilot</TT
>
as a link to the serial port. The pilot-link suite uses this device
by default, so if the link exists it will save you having to specify
it each time you call one of the programs. </P

>To create the link, log on as root and enter the following command: </P

this case <TT

be a symbolic link to <TT

references to <TT

>If you use symbolic links with devfs, you may find that the links do not persist 
correctly after you reboot. The <TT

>USB access to Palm devices is relatively new. The Handspring
Visor seems to be well supported, and works with the pilot-link
suite. Currently, the Palm m500 series only works with coldsync, although
pilot-link support is in active development. <EM
>Update:</EM
> 
the current development version of pilot-link, 0.10.x, has support for 
USB devices. See the pilot-link section for more about this release. </P
><P
>To use any
USB device under Linux, you need to have USB support in your kernel. You
will also need the relevant modules available. Most (TODO: Check which
distros work out of the box) recent Linux distributions have USB support
enabled by default. To check your system, try the following command as

>If you have problems synchronising via USB, try an updated kernel. There 
may be some timing issues with the USB driver. For example, I found that 
stock Mandrake 8.1 did not work on one PC, but worked first time on a faster
 PC. Upgrading to a stock 2.4.17 kernel solved the problem and worked fine on
 both PCs.</P
