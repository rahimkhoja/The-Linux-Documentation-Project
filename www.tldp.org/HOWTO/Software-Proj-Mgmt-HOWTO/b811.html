       done with law, but with the code itself and how the nature of
       the code will determine the nature of future freedoms. In
       addition to being a quick and enjoyable read, it gives some

>       Although I have to honestly say that I am not the ESR fan that
       I used to be, this book proved invaluable in getting me where I
       am today. The essay that gives the book its title does a good
       job of sketching the free software process and does an an
       amazing job of making an argument for free software/open source
       development as a road to better software. The rest of the book
       has other of ESR's articles, which for the most part are posted
       on his website. Still, it's nice thing to own in hard copy and
       something that every free software/open source hacker should
       read.

><P
>This paper examines the latest of
	paradigms - the Virtual Network(ed) Organisation - and whether
	geographically dispersed knowledge workers can virtually
	collaborate for a project under no central
	planning. Co-ordination, management and the role of knowledge
	arise as the central areas of focus. The Linux Project and its
	development model are selected as a case of analysis and the
	critical success factors of this organisational design are
	identified. The study proceeds to the formulation of a
	framework that can be applied to all kinds of virtual
	decentralised work and concludes that value creation is
	maximized when there is intense interaction and uninhibited
	sharing of information between the organisation and the
	surrounding community. Therefore, the potential success or
	failure of this organisational paradigm depends on the degree
	of dedication and involvement by the surrounding
	community.</P

>This paper was referred to me in my capacity as author of
      this HOWTO and I was very impressed. It's written by a graduate
      student in management and I think it succeeds at evaluating the
      Linux project as an example of a new paradigm in management--one
      that <EM

      center of in your capacity as maintainer of a free software
      project.</P

>As a developer trying to control an application and guide
      it to success in the free software world, I'm not sure how
      useful Dafermos's argument is. It does however, provide a
      theoretical justification for my HOWTO--free software project
      management <EM
>is</EM
> a different creature than
      proprietary software project management. If you are interested
      in the conceptual and theoretical ways that free software
      project management differs from other types of management, this
      is a great paper to read. If this paper answers questions of
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

      defend) questions of <SPAN

       Monty sums up some of the major points I touch on including:
       starting a project, testing, documentation, organizing a team and
       leadership, and several other topics. While more opinionated that
       I try to be, I think its an important article that I found very
       helpful in writing this HOWTO. I've tried to cite him in
       the places where I borrowed from him most.

>At first glance, ESR's release practice HOWTO seems to
      share a lot of terrain with this document. Upon closer
      examination, the differences become apparent but they are
      closely related. His document, read in conjunction with mine,
      will give a reader a good picture of how to go about managing a
      project. ESR's HOWTO goes into a bit more detail on how to write
      and what languages to write in. He tends to give more specific
      instructions and checklists (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"name this file this, not
      this"</SPAN
>) while this HOWTO speaks more conceptually. There
      are several sections that are extremely similar. It's also
      <EM
>much</EM
> shorter.</P
><P
>My favorite quote from his HOWTO is: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>""Managing a
      project well when all the participants are volunteers presents
      some unique challenges. This is too large a topic to cover in a
      HOWTO."</SPAN

>Venugopalan provides one of the best essays on
      effective use of CVS that I've come across. It is written for
      people who already have a good knowledge of CVS. In the chapter
      on branching, he describes when and how to branch but gives no
      information on what CVS commands you should use to do this. This
      is fine (technical CVS HOWTO have been written) but CVS newbies
      will want to spend some time with Fogel's reference before they
      will find this one very useful.</P
><P
>Venugopalan creates checklists of things to do before,
      after, and around releases. It's definitely worth a read through
      as most of his ideas will save tons of developer head aches over
      any longer period of time.</P

       author argues that Monty calls simply for the application of

       something new. I found his article to be extremely well thought
