NAME="INTRO">1. Introduction</H1
><P
>   Skimming through freshmeat.net provides mountains of reasons for this
   HOWTO's existence--the Internet is littered with excellently
   written and useful programs that have faded away into the universe
   of free software forgottenness. This dismal scene made me ask
   myself, "Why?"
  </P
><P
>   This HOWTO tries to do a lot of things (probably too many), but it
   can't answer that question and won't attempt it. What this HOWTO
   will attempt to do is give your Free Software project a fighting
   chance--an edge. If you write a piece of crap that no one is
   interested in, you can read this HOWTO until you can recite it in
   your sleep and your project will probably fail. Then again, you can
   write a beautiful, relevant piece of software and follow every
   instruction in this HOWTO and your software may still not make
   it. Sometimes life is like that. However, I'll go out a limb and
   say that if you write a great, relevant pieces of software and
   ignore the advise in this HOWTO, you'll probably fail <EM
>   more often</EM
>.
  </P
><P
>   A lot of the information in this HOWTO is best called common
   sense. Of course, as any debate on interfaces will prove, what is
   common sense to some programmers proves totally unintuitive to
   others. After explaining bits and pieces of this HOWTO to Free
   Software developers on several occasions, I realized that writing
   this HOWTO might provide a useful resource and a forum for
   programmers to share ideas about what has and has not worked for
   them.
  </P
><P
>   As anyone involved in any of what seems like an unending parade of
   ridiculous intellectual property clashes will attest to, a little
   bit of legalese proves important.

NAME="CREDITS">1.4. Credits</H2
><P
>    In this version I have the pleasure of acknowledging:
   </P
><P
>Fellow Debian developer Martin Michlmayr and Vivek
   Venugopalan who sent me information and links to extremely
   interesting articles. I've added both to the bibliography and I've
   added information from each into the HOWTO. Thanks to Andrew Shugg
   who pointed out several errors in the document. Also, a big thanks
   to Sung Wook Her (AKA RedBaron) who is doing the first translation
   of the HOWTO into Korean. I've been happy to see that people have
   enjoyed and benefited from the HOWTO so far.</P
><P
>    Older thanks that I don't want to take out yet include: Josh
    Crawford, Andy King, and Jaime Davila who all read through this in
    entirety and gave me feedback that has helped me make changes and
    improvements to this document. I can't thank you guys enough for
    your help. An extra <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Thank You"</SPAN
> goes to Andy King who
    who read through this several times and submitted patches to make
    life easier for me.
   </P
><P
>    Karl Fogel, the author of <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Open Source Development with
    CVS</I
> published by the Coriolis Open Press. Large parts
    of his book are available <A
HREF="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com"
TARGET="_top"
>on the web</A
>. 225 pages of
    the book are available under the GPL and constitute the best
    tutorial on CVS I've ever seen. The rest of the book covers,
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the challenges and philosophical issues inherent in running
    an Open Source project using CVS."</SPAN
> The book does a good job
    of covering some of the subjects brought up in this HOWTO and much
    more. <A
HREF="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com"
TARGET="_top"
>The book's
    website</A
> has information on ordering the book and provides
    several translations of the chapters on CVS. If you are seriously
    interested in running a Free Software project, you want this
    book. I tried to mention Fogel in sections of this HOWTO where I
    knew I was borrowing directly from his ideas. If I missed any, I'm
    sorry. I'll try and have those fixed in future versions.

><P
>    Also providing support material, and inspiration for this HOWTO is
    Eric S. Raymond for his prolific, consistent, and carefully
    crafted arguments and Lawrence Lessig for reminding me of the
    importance of Free Software. Additionally, I want to thank every
    user and developer involved with the <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Debian Project</A
>. The project
    has provided me with a home, a place to practice free software
    advocacy, a place to make a difference, a place to learn from
    those who have been involved with the movement much longer than I,
    and proof of a free software project that definitely, definitely
    works.
   </P
><P
>    Above all, I want to thank <EM
>Richard Stallman</EM
>
    for his work at the Free Software Foundation and for never giving
    up. Stallman provides and articulates the philosophical basis that
    attracts me to free software and that drives me toward writing a
    document to make sure it succeeds. RMS can always be emailed at

    I'd love for this HOWTO to gain the kind of international reach
    afforded by translated versions.
   </P

>    I've been contacted by a reader who promises a translation into
    Korean. However, this HOWTO is still young and other than the
    promise of Korean, English is all that is currently available. If
    you would like to help with or do a translation, you will gain my
    utmost respect and admiration and you'll get to be part of a cool
    process. If you are at all interested, please don't hesitate to
