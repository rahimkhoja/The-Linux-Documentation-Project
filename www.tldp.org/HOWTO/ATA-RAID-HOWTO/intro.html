NAME="INTRO">1. Introduction</H1
><P
>The goal of this HOWTO document is to explain how to setup RAID 1 (mirroring) with the two hard disks and install bootable RedHat Linux Operating System on the mirror device. This document discusses both methods of achieving this goal: 1. Using Promise supplied driver 2. Using Linux native RAID. If you choose the first method (using Promise supplied driver), you must use the Kernel 2.4.7-10 that comes with RedHat 7.2 CD. If you choose the second method, you can upgrade the kernel to the latest kernel (2.4.18). This document does not discuss Striping or other disk configurations, although the author believes that this document might help setup those configurations.  This document does not yet cover: 1. Installation using GRUB instead of LILO and 2. Installation with Latest development kernels (2.5.x).</P
><P
>   First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development
   shows it is quite important.
