<H2><A NAME="s3">3. How Electronic Mail Works</A></H2>

<P>Now we'll explain the flow of information that typically takes place when
two people to communicate by email.  Let us suppose that 
Alice, on her machine <CODE>wonderland.com</CODE>, wants to send mail to
Bob, on his machine <CODE>dobbs.com</CODE>.  Both machines are connected
to the Internet.
<P>It helps to know that an Internet mail message consists of two parts;
mail headers and a mail body, separated by a blank
line.  The mail headers contain the source and destination of the
mail, a user-supplied subject line, the date it was sent, and various
other kinds of useful information.  The body is the actual content
of the message.  Here's an example:
<P>

<P>To send mail, Alice will invoke a program called a mail user agent
(or MUA for short).  The MUA is what users think of as `the
mailer'; it helps her compose the message, usually by calling out to a
text editor of her choice.  When she hits the MUA `send' button, her
part of the process is done.  Later in this HOWTO we will survey
popular MUAs.
<P>The MUA she uses immediately hands her message to a program called a
mail transport agent (or MTA). Usually this
program will be <CODE>sendmail</CODE>, though some alternative MTAs are
gaining popularity and may appear in future Linux distributions.  Later
in this HOWTO we will also survey MTAs.
<P>The MTA's job is to pass the mail to an MTA on Bob's machine.  It
determines Bob's machine by analyzing the To header and seeing the
<CODE>dobbs.com</CODE> on the right-hand side of Bob's address.  It uses
that address to open an Internet connection to Bob's machine.  The
mechanics of making that connection are a whole other topic; for this 
explanation, it's enough to know that that connection is a way for
Alice's MTA to send text commands to Bob's machine and receive replies
to those commands.
<P>The MTA's commands don't go to a shell.  Instead they go to a service port on Alice's machine.  A service port is a sort of
rendezvous, a known place where Internet service programs listen for
incoming requests.  Service ports are numbered, and Alice's MTA knows
that it needs to talk to port 25 on Bob's machine to pass mail.
<P>On port 25, Bob's machine has its own MTA listening for commands
(probably another copy of sendmail).  Alice's MTA will go through
a dialogue with Bob's using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(or SMTP).  Here is what an SMTP dialogue looks like.
Lines sent by Alice's machine are shown with S:, responses from
Bob's machine are shown with R:.
<P>

      S: DATA
      R: 354 Start mail input; end with &lt;CRLF>.&lt;CRLF>
      S: From: "Alice" &lt;alice@wonderland.com>

      R: 250 OK
</PRE>
<P>Usually an SMTP command is a single text line and so is its response.
The DATA command is an exception; after seeing that, the SMTP listener
accepts message lines until it sees a period on a line by itself.
(SMTP is defined by the Internet standard 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc821.txt">RFC821</A>.)
<P>Now Bob's MTA has Alice's message.  It will add a header to the
message that looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Received: (from alice@wonderland.com)
        by mail.dobbs.com (8.8.5/8.8.5) id MAA18447
        for bob@dobbs.com; Thu, 13 Nov 1997 12:04:05 -0500
</PRE>
<P>This is for tracking purposes in case of mail errors (sometimes a
message has to be relayed through more than one machine and will have
several of these).  Bob's MTA will pass the modified message to a
local delivery agent or LDA.  On Linux systems
the LDA is usually a program called <CODE>procmail</CODE>, though others
exist.
<P>The LDA's job is to append the message to Bob's mailbox.  It's
separate from the MTA so that both programs can be simpler, and
so the MTA can concentrate on doing Internet things without
worrying about local details like where the user mailboxes live.
<P>Bob's mailbox will normally be a file called /usr/spool/mail/bob
or /var/mail/bob.  When he reads mail, he runs his own MUA (mail
user agent) to look at and edit that file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Notifiers</A>
</H2>

<P>There's yet another kind of program that is important in the mail
chain, though it does not itself read or transmit mail.  It's 
a <EM>mail notifier</EM>, a program that watches your email in-box
for activity and signals you when new mail is present.
<P>The original notifier was a pair of Unix programs called biff(1) and
comsat(8). The biff program is a front end that enables you to turn on the
comsat service.  When this service is on, the header of new 
mail will be dumped to your terminal as it arrived.  This facility
was designed for people using line-oriented programs on CRTs; it's
not really a good idea in today's environment.
<P>Most Unix shells have built-in mailcheck facilities that allow them to
function as notifiers in a rather less intrusive way (by emitting a
message just before the prompt when new mail is detected).  Typically
you can enable this by setting environment variables documented on the
shell's manual page.  For shells in the sh/ksh/bash family, see the
MAIL and MAILPATH variables
<P>Systems supporting X come with one of several little desktop gadgets
that check for new mail periodically and give you both visible and
audible indication of new mail.  The oldest and most widely used of
these is called <EM>xbiff</EM>; if your Linux has a preconfigured X desktop
setup, xbiff is probably on it.  See the xbiff(1) manual page for
details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Mail to part-time Internet machines</A>
</H2>

<P>If you were reading carefully, you may have noticed that the
information flow we described above depends on Alice's machine 
being able to talk to Bob's machine immediately.  What happens
if Bob's machine is down, or is up but not connected to the
Internet?
<P>If Alice's MTA can't reach Bob's immediately, it will stash Alice's
message in a mail queue on <CODE>wonderland.com</CODE>.  It will
then retry sending the mail at intervals until an expiration time is
reached, at which point a bounce message notifying Alice
of the failure will be sent back to her.  In the default configuration
of the most popular MTA (sendmail), the retry interval is 15 minutes and the 
expiration time is 4 days.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Remote mail and remote-mail protocols</A>
</H2>

<P>Many Linux users nowadays are connected to the Internet via ISPs
(Internet Service Providers) and don't have their own Internet
domains.  Instead they have accounts on an ISP machine.
Their mail gets delivered to a mailbox on that ISP machine.  But
typically these users want to read and reply to their mail using their
own machines, which connect to the ISP intermittently using
SLIP or PPP.  Linux supports remote mail
protocols to support this.
<P>Note how this is different from the scenario we discussed in the
last section.  Mail sitting in a queue awaiting retransmission is not
the same as mail dispatched to a server mailbox; mail in a queue is
not considered to have been delivered and is subject to expiration,
but mail delivered to an ISP server mailbox <EM>is</EM> considered
`delivered' and can sit there indefinitely.
<P>A remote-mail protocol allows mail on a server to be pulled across a
network link by a client program (this is the opposite of normal
delivery in which an MTA pushes mail to a receiving MTA).  There are
two remote-mail protocols in common use; POP3 (defined by the Internet
standard 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1939.txt">RFC1939</A>)
and IMAP (defined by the Internet
standard 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2060.txt">RFC2060</A>).
Effectively all ISPs support POP3; a growing number support IMAP (which
is more powerful).
<P>Here is what an example POP3 session looks like:
<P>
<PRE>
      S: &lt;client connects to service port 110>
      R:    +OK POP3 server ready &lt;1896.697170952@mailgate.dobbs.org>
      S:    USER bob
      R:    +OK bob
      S:    PASS redqueen
      R:    +OK bob's maildrop has 2 messages (320 octets)
      S:    STAT
      R:    +OK 2 320
      S:    LIST
      R:    +OK 2 messages (320 octets)
      R:    1 120
      R:    2 200
      R:    .
      S:    RETR 1
      R:    +OK 120 octets
      R:    &lt;the POP3 server sends message 1>
      R:    .
      S:    DELE 1
      R:    +OK message 1 deleted
      S:    RETR 2
      R:    +OK 200 octets
      R:    &lt;the POP3 server sends message 2>
      R:    .
      S:    DELE 2
      R:    +OK message 2 deleted
      S:    QUIT
      R:    +OK dewey POP3 server signing off (maildrop empty)
      S:  &lt;client hangs up>
</PRE>
<P>An IMAP session uses different commands and responses, but is
logically very similar.
<P>
<P>To take advantage of POP3 or IMAP, you need a remote mail
client program to pull your mail.  Some mail user agents have
client capabilities built in (which one supports which is noted
below), and the Netscape browser's mail facility supports both POP and
IMAP natively.
<P>The main drawback of POP client facilities built into MUAs is that you
have to explicitly tell your mailer to poll the server; you don't get
notified by xbiff(1) or equivalent, as you would for mail that is
either local or delivered by a conventional SMTP `push' connection.
Also, of course, not all MUAs can do POP/IMAP, so you may find
yourself compromising on other features.
<P>Your Linux probably comes with a program called 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/fetchmail">fetchmail</A> that is designed
specifically to talk to remote-mail servers, fetch mail, and feed it
into your normal mail delivery path by speaking SMTP to your listener.
<P>Unless you need to keep your mail on the server (for example, because
you move around between client machines a lot) fetchmail is probably a
better solution than whatever POP/IMAP features your user agent has.
Fetchmail can be told to run in background and poll your server
periodically, so your xbiff(1) or other mail-notifier program will
work as it would for SMTP mail.  Also, fetchmail is rather more
tolerant of various idiosyncracies and nonstandard server quirks than
the clients in MUAs, and has better error recovery.
<P>Here's a diagram showing how both cases (with and without fetchmail) work:

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Mailbox formats</A>
</H2>

<P>When incoming mail gets appended to a mailbox, it's up to the MTA 
to provide some kind of delimiters that tell where one message stops
and the next begins. 
<P>Under Unix, the convention almost all mailers use is that each line
beginning with ``From '' (the space is significant) begins a new
message.  If ``From '' occurs at the beginning of a line in text, a
Unix MTA will generally prefix it with a greater-than sign, so it looks
like ``>From ''.  RFC822 headers follow this From line (which usually
continues with the sender name and receipt date).
<P>This convention originated with Unix Version 7, so this kind of
mailbox is referred to as a ``V7 mailbox''; it is also sometimes
called ``mbox format''.  Unless otherwise noted, all programs
mentioned in this HOWTO expect this format.  It is not, however, quite
universal, and tools expecting and generating different formats can
confuse each other badly.
<P>The four other formats to know about (and beware of!) are BABYL, 
MMDF, MH, and qmail maildir.  Of these, MMDF is the simplest; 
it uses a delimiter line consisting four control-As (ASCII 001) 
characters followed by CR-LF.  MMDF was an early and rather 
crude Internet mail transport; a descendant is still in use on
SCO systems.
<P>BABYL is another survival, from an early mail system at MIT.  It is
still used by Emacs's mail-reader mode.
<P>MH and qmail maildir are `mailbox' formats which actually burst 
each mailbox into a directory of files, one per message.  Running
grep on such a `mailbox' will get you nowhere, since all grep will
see are the directory bits.
<P>Microsoft Outlook Express .mbx mailboxes can be converted to 
RFC822 format with mbx2mbox app.
