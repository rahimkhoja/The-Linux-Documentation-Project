<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Troubleshooting</A></H2>

<P>Here are some common problems that may arise.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Server Appears to start, but you cannot access the secure site</A>
</H2>

<P>Check the <CODE>error_log</CODE> file.  If you did not set your virtual
host to write to an error log, you may want to reconsider.  The
example SSL virtual host writes to an error log file.  Most likely
you will have a few warnings and an error at the end of the log that
basically say that the private key does not match the certificate.

<P>
<P>If you get the error messages above, chances are the key and certificate do
not match.  Make sure you aren't using the default <CODE>server.key</CODE> file.  You
should also check the <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE> file to make sure that the directives are
pointing to the correct private key and certificate.
<P>
<P>You can check to make sure that you your private key and certificate are in
the correct format and match each other.  To do this, give the commands
below to decrypt the private key in one terminal window and decrypt the
certificate in the other.  What you will be comparing are the Modulus and
the Exponent of each key.  If the modulus and exponent from the key matches
the set from the certificate, you have just confirmed that your certificate
and key are correctly paired.
<P>
<P>If all else fails, create a new private key, CSR or self-signed
certificate.  Before you do this, check your CA's re-issue policy.  You may
be charged for a re-issue.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Certificate Name Check Warning is issued by the client's browser</A>
</H2>

<P>The most common cause for this is omitting the "www" at the beginning of the
domain name when creating the CSR.  The name defined by the "ServerName"
directive for that virtual host must match the domain name presented by the
certificate exactly or the browser will let the client know.  The exception
is a wild card certificate.  A wild card certificate's domain name field
would look like *.somedomain.com.  This enables you to use one certificate
for any number of sub-domains of somedomain.com (e.g. host1.somedomain.com
and host2.somedomain.com).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Certificate was Signed by an Untrusted Certificate Authority Warning</A>
is issued by the client's browser</H2>

<P>If you are using a self-signed certificate, you will get this warning.  Your
clients will be given the option to trust your certificate or not.  If you
have a CA signed certificate and are getting the untrusted warning, you
probably need to install their intermediate (root) certificate.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 SSLEngine on is an un-recognized command (when starting Apache)</A>
</H2>

<P>This error message is issued if you do not have ModSSL compiled with
Apache.  Some SSL packages use a different directive to start SSL within a
virtual host.  If you are using a package that does use a different
directive, you will also receive this error message.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 You have forgotten your "PEM Passphrase" and you would like to know</A>
how to reset it</H2>

<P>There is no way to reset this passphrase.  The only solution is to remember
the passphrase or create a new private key.  You will then need to obtain a
new certificate or create a new self-signed certificate.
