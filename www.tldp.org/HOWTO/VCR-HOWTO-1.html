This is a guide to setting up your GNU/Linux computer as a VCR.  Setting up my VCR took a little research, but it
didn't turn out to be as difficult as I thought.  I decided to publish my results so others may benefit from what
I've done.  This is by no means the only method to achieve the same results as there are several applications out
there that may perform similar tasks.  Hopefully any unique procedures for configuring other software or devices
may be incorporated into this document.
