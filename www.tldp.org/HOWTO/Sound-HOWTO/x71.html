>This section gives a <EM
>very</EM
> cursory overview of
computer audio technology, in order to help you understand
the concepts used later in the document. You should consult a book on
digital audio or digital signal processing in order to learn more.</P
><P
>Sound is an <EM
>analog</EM
> property; it can take on any value over a
continuous range. Computers are <EM
>digital</EM
>; they like to work
with discrete values. Sound cards use a device known as an <EM
>Analog
to Digital Converter</EM
> (A/D or ADC) to convert voltages
corresponding to analog sound waves into digital or numeric values
which can be stored in memory. Similarly, a <EM
>Digital to Analog
Converter</EM
> (D/A or DAC) converts numeric values back to an analog
voltage which can in turn drive a loudspeaker, producing sound.</P
><P
>The process of analog to digital conversion, known as
sampling, introduces some error. Two factors are key in determining
how well the sampled signal represents the original. <EM
>Sampling
rate</EM
> is the number of samples made per unit of time (usually
expresses as samples per second or Hertz). A low sampling
rate will provide a less accurate representation of the analog
signal. Sample size is the range of values used to represent each
sample, usually expressed in bits. The larger the sample size, the
more accurate the digitized signal will be.</P
><P
>Sound cards commonly use 8 or 16 bit samples at sampling rates from
about 4000 to 44,000 samples per second. The samples may also be
contain one channel (mono) or two (stereo).</P
><P
><EM
>FM Synthesis</EM
> is an older technique for producing
sound. It is based on combining different waveforms (e.g. sine,
triangle, square). FM synthesis is simpler to implement in
hardware that D/A conversion, but is more difficult to program and
less flexible. Many sound cards provide FM synthesis for backward
compatibility with older cards and software. Several independent sound
generators or <EM
>voices</EM
> are usually provided.</P
><P
><EM
>Wavetable Synthesis</EM
> combines the flexibility of
D/A conversion with the multiple channel capability of FM
synthesis. With this scheme digitized voices can be downloaded into
dedicated memory, and then played, combined, and modified with little
CPU overhead. State of the art sound cards all support wavetable
synthesis.</P
><P
>Most sound cards provide the capability of <EM
>mixing</EM
>, combining
signals from different input sources and controlling gain levels.</P
><P
><EM
>MIDI</EM
> stands for Musical Instrument Digital
Interface, and is a standard hardware and software protocol for
allowing musical instruments to communicate with each other. The
events sent over a MIDI bus can also be stored as MIDI files for later
editing and playback. Many sound cards provide a MIDI interface. Those
that do not can still play MIDI files using the on-board capabilities
of the sound card.</P
><P
><EM
>MOD files</EM
> are a common format for computer
generated songs. As well as information about the musical notes to be
played, the files contain digitized samples for the instruments (or
voices). MOD files originated on the Amiga computer, but can be played
on other systems, including Linux, with suitable software.</P
><P
><EM
>MP3 files</EM
> are a popular format for distributing
computer music and speech. MP3 uses a sophisticated encoding scheme
(MPEG layer 3) to compress audio by roughly a factor of 10 with little
reduction in quality as compared to CD audio.</P
