>6.7. Port Forwarding with IPTABLES or external tools like IPPORTFW, 
IPMASQADM, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, UDPRED, and other Port Forwarding tools</H1
><P
>IPTABLES as well as IPPORTFW, IPAUTOFW, REDIR, UDPRED, and other programs offer
generic TCP and/or UDP port forwarding for Linux IP Masquerade.  These 
tools are typically used with or as a replacement for specific IP MASQ modules 
to get a specific network traffic through the MASQ server.  </P
><P
>With port forwarders, you can redirect data connections from the Internet to 
an internal, privately addressed machine behind your IP MASQ server.  This 
forwarding ability includes network protocols such as TELNET, WWW, and SMTP. 
Protocols such as FTP, legacy ICQ, and others require special handling via
kernel modules (see below). </P
><P
><STRONG
>NOTE:  </STRONG
>If you are just looking to do simple 
port forwarding but you don't need Masquerading support, you don't have any 
choice.  You will <STRONG
>STILL NEED</STRONG
> to enable IP 
Masquerading support in the kernel AND either run a IPTABLES, IPCHAINS, or 
IPFWADM ruleset to be able to use Linux's port forwarding tools.</P
><P
>So why all the different choices?  IPTABLES, IPPORTFW, MARK (MFW), IPMASQADM 
(PORTFW or AUTOFW), IPAUTOFW, REDIR, and UDPRED (all URLs are in 
<A
HREF="ipmasq-compiling3.1.html#IPMASQ-COMPILING3.1.3"
>Section 3.2.3</A
>) are the various tools available to IP 
MASQ users to allow this type of functionality depending on their kernel
version.  Later, as the Linux IP Masquerade feature matured, many of these 
tools were eventually replaced by the IPTABLES or PORTFW and MARK systems 
which are far more intelligent solutions.  </P
><P
>For the later 2.2.x kernels, the IPMASQADM tool combined the legacy IPAUTOFW and 
IPPORTFW 2.0.x kernel tools into one binary.  Both the IPMASQADM tool for 2.2.x
kernels as well as IPTABLES for the 2.6.x and 2.4.x kernels also supports a 
new mechanism called "MARK" or MFW for PORTFW functionality.  The MARK system 
works where a specific IPTABLES or IPCHAINS ruleset would match a given packet 
sequence.  Once matched, the tool would "mark" these packets.  Later, the 
IPMASQADM tool or a specific IPTABLE "table" could be instructed to change 
these packets as needed and forward them off to their desired internal 
destination.  Currently, this HOWTO doesn't cover the MARK solution but it 
will in the future.</P
><P
>Anyway, because of the availablity of the newer tools, it is *HIGHLY 
DISCOURAGED* to use the old tools such as IPAUTOFW (even AUTOFW in IPMASQADM) 
and REDIR because they don't properly notify the Linux kernel of their 
presence and can ultimately <STRONG
>CRASH</STRONG
> your 
Linux server with extreme use.  </P
><P
><STRONG
>NOTE #2:  </STRONG
>With enabling PORTFW functionality 
in ANY 2.2/2.0 Linux kernel (2.6.x. and 2.4.x users won't use these specific 
tools anyway), <STRONG
>internal 
machines typically CANNOT use the same "external" PORTFWed IP address to 
access a given internal" machine.</STRONG
>  To put it another way, PORTFW 
was only intended to be used with "external" computers on the Internet.  If 
this is an issue for you, you can also use the REDIR tool for older 2.2.x and 
2.0.x kernels to let internal machines get redirected to the internal servers 
too.  2.6.x and 2.4.x kernels users running IPTABLES solves this issue once 
and for all and is fully covered in a FAQ entry in 
<A
HREF="portfw-local.html"
>Section 7.19</A
> below.  If you would like a technical 
explination on why this internal/external forwarding doesn't work, please page 
down towards the bottom of the 2.2.x PORTFW section for a note from 
Juan Jose Ciarlante.</P
><P
>NOTE #3: The forwarding of non-NAT friendly traffic such as FTP server traffic 
to an internal MASQed FTP server, known as <STRONG
>PORTFW 
FTP</STRONG
>, is now fully supported in the 2.6.x and 2.4.x kernels as well 
as in the 2.2.x kernels via a BETA version FTP kernel module (does NOT come 
with the stock Linus kernels).  It should also be noted that you can also 
PORTFW FTP traffic using an external FTP proxy program (not covered in this 
HOWTO).  It should be noted that the Beta 2.2.x FTP 
kernel module code is still experimental and some people get better results 
simply using ACTIVE FTP sessions compared to PASSIVE connections.  
Interestingly enough, other people have seen the exact opposite behavior.  
Please let us know what your results are like.  More about this is 
covered below in both the 2.2.x and 2.0.x sections as the solutions require
the use of different patches.</P
><P
><STRONG
>WARNING!</STRONG
>  Before jumping right into 
installing ANY of these tools, it needs to be mentioned that network security 
can be an issue with <EM
>ANY</EM
> PORT FORWARD tool.  The reason 
for this is because these tools basically create a hole in strong packet 
firewalls for the required TCP/UDP ports.  Though this doesn't pose any threat 
to your Linux machine, it might be an issue to the PORTFW'ed internal 
machine(s).  No worries though, this is what Steven Clarke (the author of 
IPPORTFW) had to say about that:</P

>   "Port Forwarding is only called within masquerading functions so it 
   fits inside the same IPFWADM/IPCHAINS rules. Masquerading is an extension to 
   IP forwarding. Therefore, ipportfw only sees a packet if it fits 
   both the input and masquerading ipfwadm rule sets."</PRE

>What that means in English is that if you have a strong packet firewall
running, PORTFW doesn't directly bypass any of that security.  You will still 
be able to allow or deny specific IPs and/or domains to this new PORTFW'ed 
resource if you so wish.</P

>Please note, if you setup PORTFW to redirect traffic to an internal FTP server 
that is running on a NON-standard FTP port, say port 8021 instead of the usual
port 21, you MUST tell the "ip_conntrack_ftp" module to be aware of the new 
FTP port.  The reason for this configuration change is that FTP is not a 
NAT-friendly protocol.  By telling the FTP NAT module about this non-standard 
FTP port, the NAT module and do it's job again.  To enable this, edit your

>In the past, if users PORTFWed port 80 on their EXTERNAL IP address to some 
internal machine, only the machines out on the Internet would be able to 
properly reach this internal WWW server.  If you tried to contact this 
internal WWW server via the MASQ server's EXTERNAL address, it would fail.  
Fortunately, there are workarounds for all Linux kernels.  IPTABLES for the 
2.6.x and 2.4.x kernels supports this functionality natively.  IPCHAINS support 
for the 2.2.x kernels and IPFWADM support for the 2.0.x kernels need to use 
the external REDIR tool (not currently covered in the HOWTO).  For those of 
you who understand IPTABLES fairly well, the rule of thumb is a 
PREROUTING/DNAT rule is for enabling PORTFW from *external* machines and a 
POSTROUTING/SNAT rule is for enabling PORTFW from *internal* machines.</P
><P
>To support redirection like this from an internal host, add a rule like 
the one shown below ABOVE the "Catch all" FORWARDing rule in the rc.firewall-* 
file.  The following example will REDIRECT all external as well as internal 
WWW traffic to the internal machine noted as PORTFWIP (192.168.0.10).  This 
traffic will have the source IP address of the IP Masq server's internal

--

&#62;If I use:
&#62;
&#62; ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp  -L 1.2.3.4 80 -R 192.168.2.3 80
&#62;
&#62;Everything works great from the outside but internal requests for the same
&#62;1.2.3.4 address fail. Are there chains that will allow a machine on localnet 
&#62;192.168.2.0 to accesss www.periapt.com without using a proxy? 

Actually not.

I usually setup a ipmasqadm rule for outside, *AND* a port
redirector for inside. This works because ipmasqadm hooks before
redir will get the eventual outside connection, _but_ leaves things
ok if not (stated by APPROPIATE rules).

The actual "conceptual" problem comes from the TRUE client (peer) IP
goal (thanks to masq) being in the same net as target server.

The failing scenario for "local masq" is :
   client: 192.168.2.100
   masq:   192.168.2.1
   serv:   192.168.2.10

1)client-&#62;server packet
 a) client:  192.168.2.100:1025  -&#62; 192.168.2.1:80   [SYN]
 b) (masq):  192.168.2.100:1025  -&#62; 192.168.2.10:80  [SYN]
            (and keep  192.168.2.1:61000 192.168.2.100:1025 related)
 c) serv:    gets masqed packet (1b)

2)server-&#62;client packet
 a) serv:    192.168.2.10:80     -&#62; 192.168.2.100:1025  [SYN,ACK]
 b) client:  192.168.2.100:1025  -&#62; 192.168.2.10:80     [RST]

Now take a moment to compare (1a) with (2a).
You see, the server replied DIRECTLY to client bypassing masq (not
letting masq to UNDO the packet hacking) because it is in SAME net, so
the client resets the connection.

hope I helped.

Warm regards

>  Once you enable a port forwarder on

To be more specific, if you have a WWW server already running on the MASQ 
server and then you port forward port 80 to an internal MASQed computer, ALL 
internet users will see the WWW pages pages from the -INTERNAL- WWW server and 
not the pages on your IP MASQ server.  This only performs a port forward to 
some other port, say 8080, to your internal MASQ machine.  Though this will 
work, all Internet users will have to append <STRONG
>:8080</STRONG

>Port Forwarding FTP servers:</P
><P
>If you plan on port forwarding FTP to an internal machine, things get more 
complicated.  The reason for this is because the standard 
<STRONG
>IP_MASQ_FTP</STRONG
> kernel module wasn't written 
for this though some users report that it works without any problems.  
Personally, without the patch, I've heard that extended file transfers in 
excess of 30 minutes will fail without the patch while other users swear that 
it works flawlessly.  Anyway, I recommend that you try the following PORTFW 
instruction with the STOCK ip_masq_ftp module and see if it works for you.  If 
it doesn't, try using the modified ip_masq_ftp module.</P
><P
>For those who need the module, Fred Viles wrote a modified IP_MASQ_FTP module 
to make things work.  If you are curious what EXACTLY are the issues, download 
the following archive since Fred documents it quite well.  Also understand that 
this patch is somewhat experimental and should be treated as such.  It should 
be noted that this patch is ONLY available for the 2.0.x kernels though there 
is a different patch available for 2.2.x kernels.</P

# /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp ports=21,2121,2112
#
# Re-run the /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall-* script for these changes to
# take effect.


#Please note that PORTFWing port 20 is probably NOT required
