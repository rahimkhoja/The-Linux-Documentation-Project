Though this isn't a Masquerading issue but many users do this so it should be 
mentioned.  </P

>SMTP:  The issue is that you are probably using your Linux box as an SMTP 
relay server and get the following error:</P

Newer versions of Sendmail and other Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) disable 
relaying by default (this is a good thing).  So do the following to fix this:</P

>Sendmail:  Enable specific relaying for your internal MASQed machines by editing 
the /etc/sendmail.cw file and add the hostname and domain name of your internal 
MASQed machine.  You should also check to see that the /etc/hosts file has the 
IP address and Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) configured in it.  Once this 
is done, you need to restart Sendmail for it to re-read its configuration 
files.  This is covered in

>POP-3:  Some users configure their internal MASQ'ed computer's POP-3 clients to 
connect to some external SMTP server.  While this is fine, many SMTP servers 
out there will try to IDENT your connection on port 113.  Most likely your 
problem stems around your default Masquerade policy being set to DENY.  This is 
BAD.  Set it to REJECT and re-run your rc.firewall-* ruleset.</P
