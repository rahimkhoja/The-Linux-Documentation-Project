>7.19. ( PORTFW - Locally ) - I can't reach my PORTFWed server from the INTERNAL lan</H1
><P
>Basically, say your domain, acme.com, has an external IP address of 1.2.3.4 
and you are PORTFWing all WWW traffic to an internal machine, say, 
192.168.0.20/24.  Then an /internal/ user on the 192.169.0.x network tries to 
contact to http://www.acme.com and expects things to work.  Well, that isn't 
going to happen with a basic config.  Let me explain.  Basically, 
http://www.acme.com is being resolved to the IP of http://1.2.3.4 by your
chosen DNS server.  What really should be happening is the web request should
resolve that request to http://192.168.0.20.</P
><P
>See the difference?</P
><P
>The proper solution to this is to setup a SPLIT DNS server.  Internal users
would be configured to use an /internal/ DNS server which would resolve 
requests like this with the 192.168.0.20 address when asked for www.acme.com.  
All external users should be serviced by an /external/ DNS server which will 
will resolve the requrest to the 1.2.3.4 IP address.  From there, 
IPTABLES/IPCHAINS/IPFWADM would then PORTFW the traffic to the 192.168.0.20 
server as normal.</P
><P
>But you're probably thinking that you don't want to setup a split DNS server
and there has to be another way.  There are a few alternatives!  The first
alternative is if you only have a few internal machines.  Here, you can  
setup a "hosts" file entry on *all* internal machines.  That static hosts entry 
would basically look like:</P

></FONT

></TABLE
></P
><P
>Got it?  With that in place, the machine would consult the hosts table before
going to the DNS server to resolve the host.  This works well but if you change
the IP address on that internal web server, you're going to need to manually 
update the hosts file on all of those internal machines.  If you are 
interested in doing the more scalable split DNS approach, TrinityOS completely 
covers split and chrooted DNS servers.

>Now, if neither the split DNS nor the hosts file approach interests you, you 
still have a simple but effective alternative to get things working.  What you
can do is add some specific rules to your rc.firewall-* ruleset.  Please see 
the "PORTFW Redirection of Internal requests" section under the

>Section 6.7</A
> chapter.</P
><P
>Why didn't I mention this alternative solution first?  The main reason is
that it's not the ideal solution.  The primary problem with this approach is 
that every packet will be going from the internal MASQed client to the MASQ 
server.  There, the MASQ server will SNAT each packet to the internal MASQed 
WWW server's IP and then forward it to the internal web server.  Once the 
packet is received and responded to by the web server, that response has to
go back through all that processing back to the original client machine. This 
process is overly wasteful on both network bandwidth and MASQ server CPU 
cycles!</P
