>IP Masquerade has been in the Linux kernels for several years now and is quite 
mature as the kernel enters the 2.4.x stage.  Kernels since Linux 1.3.x have 
had MASQ support built-in.  Today, many individuals and commercial businesses 
are using it with excellent results.  </P

>2.4.x kernel users:

>  The 2.4.x kernel hosts an entirely re-written set of NAT code which is 
  both far superior, faster, and more secure than any previous versions
  written for Linux.  Unfortunately, several kernel modules that were
  written for the 2.2.x kernel to support things like UDP-based RealAudio,
  etc. have not been ported to 2.4.x yet.  Because of this, some people 
  should consider NOT upgrading if these network applications are critical 
  to them.  But, at the same time, some of these programs have been updated
  and now use different, NAT-friendly protocols.  Thus special NAT treatment 
  is no longer required.  As always, please see the

>Common network functionalities like Web browsing, telnet, ssh, ping, 
traceroute, etc. work well over stock IP Masquerade setups.  Other network 
applications such as ftp, irc, and Real Audio work well with the appropriate 
additional IP MASQ modules loaded into the kernel as modules.  Other 
network-specific programs like streaming audio (MP3s, True Speech, etc) should
work too without any special module.  Some users on the mailing list also had 
good results with video conferencing software.   </P
><P
>It should be noted that running IP Masquerade with only ONE network card (NIC) 
to MASQ between internal and external Ethernet networks is NOT recommended.
