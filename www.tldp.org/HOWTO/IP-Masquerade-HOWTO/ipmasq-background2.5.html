In the above drawing, a Linux box with IP_MASQUERADING is installed as Linux 
#1 and is connected to the Internet via PPP, Ethernet, etc.  It has an 
assigned public IP address of 111.222.121.212.  It also has another network
interface (e.g. modem2) connected to allow incoming network traffic be it
from a PPP connection, Ethernet connection, etc.</P
><P
>The second system (which does not need to be Linux) connects into the 
Linux #1 box and starts its network traffic to the Internet.  This second 
machine does NOT have a publicly assigned IP address from the Internet, so it 
uses an 
<A

TARGET="_top"
>RFC1918 private address</A
>, say 192.168.0.100. (see below for more info)</P
><P
> With IP Masquerade and the routing configured properly, this second machine 
"Anybox" can interact with the Internet as if it was directly connected to 
the Internet with a few small exceptions [noted later].</P
><P
>Quoting Pauline Middelink (the founder of Linux's IPMASQ):</P
><P
>"Do not forget to mention that the "ANYBOX" machine should have the Linux #1 
box configured as its default gateway (whether it be the default route or 
just a subnet is no matter). If the "ANYBOX" machine is connected via a PPP
or SLIP connection, the Linux #1 machine should be configured to support 
proxy arp for all routed addresses. But, the setup and configuration of 
proxy arp is beyond the scope of this document.  Please see the <A

for more details."</P

>The following is an excerpt on how IPMASQ briefly works though this will be
explained in more detail later.  This short text is based from a previous post 
on comp.os.linux.networking which has been edited to match the names used in

>   o I tell machine ANYBOX that my PPP or Ethernet connected Linux box is its 
     gateway.

   o When a packet comes into the Linux box from ANYBOX, it will assign the 
     packet to a new TCP/IP source port number and insert its own IP address 
     inside the packet header, saving the originals.  The MASQ server will 
     then send the modified packet over the PPP/ETH interface onto the 
     Internet.

   o When a packet returns from the Internet into the Linux box, Linux 
     examines if the port number is one of those ports that was assigned 
     above.  If so, the MASQ server will then take the original port and 
     IP address, put them back in the returned packet header, and send 
     the packet to ANYBOX.

   o The host that sent the packet will never know the difference. </PRE

>In this example, there are (4) computer systems that we are concerned about.   
There is also presumably something on the far right that your PPP/ETH 
connection to the Internet comes through (modem server, DSL DSLAM, Cablemodem
router, etc.).   Out on the Internet, there exists some remote host (very far 
off to the right of the page) that you are interested in communicating with).  
The Linux system named <EM
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Masq-Gate</TT

> is 
the IP Masquerading gateway for ALL internal networked machines.  In this 
example, the machines <EM
><TT

></EM
>, <EM
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>B-box</TT
></EM
>, and <EM

> would have to go through the Masq-Gate to reach the Internet.  The 
internal network uses one of several 
<A
HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc1918.html"
TARGET="_top"
>RFC-1918 assigned private network addresses</A
>, where in this case, would 
be the Class-C network 192.168.0.0.  If you aren't familiar with RFC1918, it
is encouraged to read the first few chapters of the RFC but the jist of it is
that the TCP/IP addresses 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16-31.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 
are reserved.  When we say "reserved", we mean that anyone can use these
addresses as long as they aren't routed over the Internet.  ISPs are even
allowed to use this private addressing space as long as they keep these
addresses within their own networks and NOT advertise them to other ISPs.
Unfortunately, this isn't always the case but thats beyond the scope of
this HOWTO.</P

>Anyway, the Linux box in the diagram above has the TCP/IP address 192.168.0.1 
while the other systems has the addresses:</P

>The three machines, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>A-box</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>B-box</TT
> and 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C-box</TT
>, can have any one of several operating systems, just 
as long as they can speak TCP/IP.  Some such as <EM
>Windows 
95</EM
>, <EM
>Macintosh MacTCP or OpenTransport </EM
>, or 
even another <EM
>Linux box</EM
> have the ability to connect to 
other machines on the Internet.  When running the IP Masquerade, the 
masquerading system or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>MASQ-gate</TT
> converts all of these 
internal connections so that they appear to originate from the 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>masq-gate</TT
> itself.  MASQ then arranges so that the data 
coming back to a masqueraded connection is relayed to the proper originating 
system.   Therefore, the systems on the internal network are only able to see 
a direct route to the internet and are unaware that their data is being 
masqueraded.  This is called a "Transparent" connection.</P
