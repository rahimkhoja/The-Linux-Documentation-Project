>7.15. ( MTU ) - IP MASQ seems to be working fine but some sites don't work.  
This usually happens with WWW and some FTP sites.</H1
><P
>Depending on what Linux kernel version you are running on the MASQ server, 
some will people disagree on the real problem.  The two following arguments 
have valid points, are inter-related, and users from each camp continue to 
debate this to this day.  

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>   With modern 2.4.x Linux systems, most users point their finger at the 
   adminstrators of these remote broken sites (typically SSL-encrypted WWW
   sites, etc.) or your MASQ server's upstream router run by your ISP.  The
   main though it that these machines are either filtering or not properly 
   responding to SOME or ALL FORMS of ICMP packets (specifically ICMP Code 3 
   Type 4 - Fragmentation Needed) messages due to a fray of misplaced security 
   paranoia.  
   </P
><P
>   What does that all mean?  Basically, say your machine is connected to the 
   Internet with a MTU of 1492 bytes (Maximum Transmission Unit -- the maximum 
   packet size your computer can transmit) which is common for PPPoE users.  
   At the same time, the remote WWW/FTP site is connected to the Internet at a 
   MTU of 1500 bytes.  The way that TCP/IP works is that when a TCP connection 
   is being negotiated for your HTTP / FTP  connection, the remote side will 
   try to verify that a 1500 byte packet can reach your computer via the 
   initial TCP "SYN" packet.  
   </P
><P
>   Since the packet is too big for your connection, your upstream router (run 
   by your ISP) will send a ICMP 3:4 (fragmentation needed) packet back to the 
   remote WWW / FTP server.  Within this packet is a recommended smaller MTU 
   size to retry with.  The problem is that either your local upstream router, 
   some router between you and the remote server, or the remote HTTP / FTP 
   server is either misconfigured or has a firewall in front of it that is 
   BLOCKing these ICMP packets.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>  The final UNCOMMON possibility is a debatable 2.0 / 2.2 kernel bug in the 
  IPMASQ code.  Some users point their finger to the fact that IPMASQ might 
  have problems with ICMP packets that have the DF or "Don't Fragment" bit set.  
  Basically, when a MASQ box connects to the Internet with an MTU of anything 
  less than 1500, some packets will have the DF field set.  Though changing 
  the MTU of the MASQ server's Internet link to 1500 seemingly fixes the 
  problem, the possible bug is still there.  What is believed to be happening 
  in these older kernels is that the MASQ code is not properly re-writing the 
  return IP addresses of the ICMP 3 Sub 4 code packets back to the originating 
  MASQed computer.  Because of this, these critical packets get dropped.  
  </P

><P
>No worries though.  A there are several perfectly good ways to fix this
nasty MTU problem:

><P
>   Enable PMTU clamping in PPPoE
  </P
><P
>   This solution is mostly for modern 2.4.x and 2.2.x kernel users connected 
   to the Internet via a PPPoE DSL or Cablemodem connections.  This solution 
   allows for changes to be done ONLY on the MASQ server itself and not on all 
   of the internal MASQ clients.

   of Internet connection.  This solution allows for changes to be done ONLY on

><P
>   Change your MASQ server's Internet Link MTU
  </P
><P
>This solution will work for any Linux kernel version but is is NOT a 
   solution if you have a PPPoE connection for DSL or Cablemodem users.  
  </P
><P
>   It should be noted that some users will balk at this solution because it 
   can hurt some latency specific programs like TELNET and Internet games but 
   the impact is only slight.  On the other hand, most HTTP and FTP traffic 
   will SPEED UP!  
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   Change the MTU of all internal MASQed machines
  </P
><P
>   This solution requires the most work as you have to make minor changes to 
   ALL of the internal IPMASQed machines.  Basically, you would be changing the 
   MTU on all of the internal machines to match the MTU of your MASQ server's
   Internet connection.  Fortunately, this solution is usually bulletproof 
   where as some of the other solutions mentioned in this section might rarely
   not work.

>7.15.1. Enabling PMTU Clamping for PPPoE and some PPP Users:</H2
><P
>  For those users who use PPPoE clients for (DSL / Cablemodem) or PPP (Dialup), 
  your Internet connection is NOT "eth0" (for example) but usually "ppp0".   
  In addition to this, your Internet link's MTU or Maximum Transmission Unit 
  (largest packet you can transmit over the Internet) isn't 1500 bytes but 
  1492.  The 1492 byte MTU comes from the link size of Ethernet (1518 bytes) - 
  Ethernet MAC overhead (18) = 1500.  Then you subtract the PPPoE header (8 
  bytes) == MTU of 1492.  This overhead isn't a big deal but sometimes ISPs or 
  remote Internet sites do stupid things to break PPPoE or non-1500 byte MTU 
  connected machines.

 ICMP packets like MTU Path Discovery.  Because of this, many users might find
 more Internet sites work but others hang or work poorly.  Fortunately, 
 recent IPTABLES have added PMTU Clamping support which should help you.  If 
 your using IPTABLES and think you're hitting this issue, try adding the 
 following line to the end of your rc.firewall-iptables ruleset.  It should be noted
 that there is no PMTU clamping support in IPCHAINS.

>7.15.3. Changing the External MTU of the MASQ server:</H2
><P
> This solution usually only applies to DIALUP users since PPPoE users cannot 
 INCREASE their MTU because of PPPoE's header overhead.</P
><P
> To use this solution, first see what your current MTU for your Internet link 
 is.  To do so, run "/bin/ifconfig" on the MASQ server.  Look at the lines 
 that corresponds to your Internet connection and look for the MTU (for
 example, ppp0).  This NEEDs to be set to 1500.  Usually, Ethernet links 
 will default to 1500 for Ethernet but serial / DIALUP modem PPP links might 
 default to 576.</P

><UL
><LI
><P
>   To change the MTU on a standard Ethernet link to your bridged or routed 
   DSL, Cablemodem, etc. connection, you need to edit the correct network 
   startup scripts for your Linux distribution.  Please see the

>   CUA Users: Lastly, though this isn't a common problem, some Linux 2.0.x 
   kernel users have found a MTU solution to the following problem.  With PPP 
   users, verify what port is your PPPd code connecting to.  Is it a /dev/cua* 
   port or a /dev/ttyS* port?  It NEEDS to be a /dev/ttyS* port as the 
   /dev/cua* device ststem has been deprecated and it breaks some things in 
   very odd ways.

>7.15.4. Changing the MTU of various operating systems:</H2
><P
>If you reconfigure ALL of your MASQed PCs to use the SAME MTU as your external 
Internet link's MTU (for example, 1492 for PPPoE users), everything should 
work fine and this method is sometimes the MOST EFFECTIVE way of fixing things.  
This is including ALL of the solutions mentioned above.  But doing things this 
way can be a lot of work if there are lots of internal MASQed machines or be
even impossible to do if you don't have administrative access to all the 
internal MASQed machines. </P
><P
>Follow these simple steps for your respective operating system:  </P
><P
>The follow examples utilize an MTU of 1492 for typical PPPoE connections for 
some DSL and Cablemodem users.  It is recommended to use the HIGHEST values 
possible for all connections that are 128Kb/s and faster.  
It should be noted that some PPPoE ISPs might require an MTU setting of 1460 
(not 1492) for proper connectivity due to additional overhead in the ISP's 
internal network.  </P
><P
>The only real reason to use smaller MTUs than 1492 or 1460 is to lower your
Internet link's latency but at the cost of throughput.  Please see

1. The setting of MTU can vary from Linux distribution to distribution.  

   For Redhat: You need to edit the various "ifconfig" statements in 
               the /sbin/ifup script

   For Slackware: You need to edit the various "ifconfig" statements in 
                  the /etc/rc.d/rc1.inet

2. Here is one good, any-distribution-will-work example, edit the 
   /etc/rc.d/rc.local file and put the following at the END of the file: 

        echo "Changing the MTU of ETH0"
        /sbin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 1492

     Replace "eth0" with the interface name that is the machine's upstream 
     connection which is connected to the Internet.

3. For advanced options like "TCP Receive Windows" and such, detailed examples
   on how to edit the respective networking scripts for your specific Linux
   distro, etc., please see Chapter 16 of
