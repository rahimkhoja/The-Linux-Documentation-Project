>7.32. ( MULTIPLE IPs - DMZ segments) -  I have several EXTERNAL IP addresses that I want to
PORTFW to several internal machines.  How do I do this?</H1
><P
>Though technically possible, DON'T do this with IP MASQ.  There are far better
solutions for this network design.</P
><P
>MASQ is a 1:Many NAT setup which is the incorrect tool to perform what you are 
looking for.  You are looking for is either Many:Many NAT solution or a Briding
setup.  </P
><P
><STRONG
>NOTE: </STRONG
>For users out there who are thinking 
about enabling multiple IP addresses on one internal NIC using "IP Alias" and 
then just PORTFWeding ALL of those ports (0-65535), and and finally use 
IPROUTE2 to maintain the proper source/destination IP pairs.  This has been 
done SUCCESSFULLY on 2.0.x kernels and less successfully on 2.2.x kernels.  
Regardless of success, that isn't the proper way to do it, it's a total HACK, 
and it is not a supported MASQ configuration.  Please, give IPTABLES on the 
2.4.x kernels a serious look or to a much lesser extent,

>1. Route the external IPs 

   (This does NOT involve IPMASQ at all but requires special WAN addressing 
    and routing setup from your ISP):

    Internet -- Some public WAN -- Linux -- DMZ segment
                   IP address      Server     PUBLIC IPs
                                     |
                                     +------ Internal net
                                              private IPs</PRE

>2. 1:1 NAT 

   (Most easily done via IPTABLES or with IPCHAINS and IPROUTE2 but still 
    some protocols cannot deal with NAT)

    Internet -- Linux -- DMZ segment
                Server     Private IPs natted to 1:1 PUBLIC IPs
                   |
                   +------ Internal net
                            private IPs&#13;</PRE

>3. Bridging or ProxyARP:  

   The Bridging method is one of the more popular methods that many commercial 
   firewalls do and it's very slick.  Alternatively, you can use the ProxyARP 
   method which works well without some of the complications (or benefits of
   bridging).  With both solutions, all public IPs can transparently flow 
   through the Linux server to the DMZ but via firewall inspection.

    Internet -- Linux -- DMZ segment
                Server     PUBLIC IPs
                  |
                  +------ Internal net
                           private IPs&#13;</PRE

><P
>Each of these solutions have pros and cons</P
><P
>Item #1: If you're lucky enough to have an ISP that will set this up for you
(pretty rare), all you need to do is use basic 'route' commands to get this 
running.  This is the most rebust solution and doesn't require any form of 
IPMASQ or NAT to work.</P
><P
>Item #2:  1:1 NAT isn't covered in this HOWTO yet but if you need a hand, just 
email me and I'll give you a hand.  </P
><P
>Item #3: ProxyARP is pretty strait forward but only works in specific
situations and only works with Ethernet networks.  Bridging is more powerful 
but will probably require the re-compiling of the kernel and some advanced 
configuration.  Ultimately, neither of these solutions are IPMASQ anymore and 
thus I can't help you set them up.  Fortunately, there are other HOWTOs out 
there that cover this topic:
