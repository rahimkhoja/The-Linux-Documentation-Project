<P> All HOWTOs and other LDP documents are copyright by the authors so
the LDP doesn't have any special rights to your writing.  We only accept
documents that have a license which  permits anyone to copy and
distribute the document.  We encourage authors to also allow
modification in their license.  This way, if the author stops
maintaining a document, someone else can do so.  For more details see
our Manifesto.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="Howtos-with-LinuxDoc.html#toc2.2">Choosing a topic</A>
</H2>

<P> If you are not sure what to write about, take look at some of
LDP's documents including the ones in 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/authors/unmaint.html">Unmaintained HOWTOs</A>.  Pick a topic you're interested in that needs good
documentation.  If you find something already written and maintained
that needs improvement, try to contact the author, first and make
suggestions.  If you can't reach the author, look at the license and
see if you're allowed to modify the document.  But even in the cases
where you are not allowed to make modifications and improvements, you
can just write a new document on the same topic from scratch, using a
new outline new sources of information.</P>
