<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 How fast is Ftape ?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You can achieve quite respectable backup and restore speeds with
<EM>Ftape</EM>: a Colorado DJ-20 and an Adaptec 1542CF controller, has
been measured at 4.25Mbyte/min sustained data transfer rate (no
compression) across a 70Mbyte tar archive, while comparing the archive
on the tape with data on an IDE disk.  The speed of <EM>Ftape</EM> is
mostly dependent on the data transfer rate of your FDC: The AHA1542CF
has a ``post-1991 82077'' FDC, and it will push 1Mbit/sec at the tape
drive.  If you have an FDC which can only deliver 500Kbit/sec data
rates, you will see half the transfer rate (well, roughly).

<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 When I write to some of my tapes, they seem to spend a lot of time "shoe-shining," or repositioning instead of streaming.  Is something wrong with my system?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There has been a few reports of "shoeshining".  This is when the tape just  
seems to run back and forth endlessly.  This has been seen on a Jumbo  
250 (74407.3051@compuserve.com) and on an Iomega 250 Ditto Insider  
(tom@opus.cais.com). In the latter case it has been narrowed own to  
using an ELF Linux and running off a SCSI hard disk (connected to an  
Adaptec 1542cf).  Please contact me if you have an update to this  
problem.
<P>&lt;from the Ftape-Howto&gt;
<P>Probably not. If you are backing up a large number of &lt; 2K files, you're   
just going to have to live with it.  In this event, the repositions are caused  
by file system access overhead. If you are backing up a normal system's files,  
this may be caused by slop or media stretching in the tape cartridge. By   
simply retensioning the tape, you should see this go away. Try  
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ftmt -f /dev/zqft0 reten
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to retension the tape. If retensioning doesn't solve this, and it's only   
happening on certain tapes, it might be wise to replace the tapes in question.
<P>&lt;answer from Tim Jones&gt;
<P>If you use afio as your backup tool you can set it to write a very large   
number of buffers in one hit by using the -c flag. Make it large enough so   
that you supply enough data for most of a single end-to-end pass over the tape.
For my system, the following streams quite nicely - stopping relatively few  
times per tape pass on an unloaded system:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
find /usr/local -xdev -print | afio -o -v -f -b 10240 -c 800 /dev/qft0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In my case I'm writing 800 x 10240 bytes per tape write, i.e. about 8MB.   
haven't experimented that much with these settings - so someone might like   
to establish more optimal ones.
<P>Presumably other backup utilities could be modified to use a similar technique.
<P>&lt;answer by Michael Hamilton&gt;
<P>GNU tar doesn't use buffering in this way. The commercial backup program   
"bru" is able to multi-buffer using shared memory; this works only when   
writing compressed archive with bru (regardless whether you use <EM>Ftape's</EM>   
builtin compression)
<P>Another way to overcome the problem might be to use more dma buffers in the   
<EM>Ftape kernel driver</EM> like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/qft0 setdrvbuffer $((6&ast;32786))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

$((6&ast;32786)) should be expanded by your shell when using a Bourne  
compatible one. This has a negative impact on the system's memory pool:   
<EM>Ftape's</EM> dma buffers cannot be used by any other part of the kernel nor   
by any other application. And kernel memory cannot be swapped out. If you   
decide to use this kind of multi-buffering then you should unload the driver   
as soon as it isn't needed any longer.

</H2>

<P>
<P>If you look at the difference, you will notice that <EM>Ftape</EM>
always detects 2784 sectors more than DOS.
<P>The number that <EM>Ftape</EM> reports is correct (of course <CODE>:-)</CODE>. Each
correctly formatted QIC-3020 tape has 2784 sectors at fixed positions
that are marked in the bad sector map. To quote from the specs:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tracks 5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25 and 27 within 4 segments of
either EOT or BOT are prone to increased error rates due to hole
imprints.  Therefore, these regions shall be mapped as bad at format
time and entered in the bad sector map by indicating that all sectors
within the identified segments are bad.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This gives 12 tracks &ast; 2 &ast; 4 segments &ast; 29 sectors == 2784 sectors.
<P>So <EM>Ftape</EM> choose to report the real number of sectors that cannot be
used on the tape, while DOS gives a more optimistic number giving a
better indication of tape quality.  (<EM>Ftape's</EM> behavior might change in
the future to detect correct formatting and display the separate
numbers. It has rather low priority though).

the next read or write access to the tape drive.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.8">11.8 Why does my XYZ backup program complain about "Invalid argument" errors?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><CODE>zftape</CODE> requires the data to be written in multiples of a fixed minimal   
block size. This is a very usual behavior for a tape device. There are three   
ways to get rid of those errors:
<UL>
<LI>set <EM>Ftape's</EM> block size to the block size used by the backup program. The example below works for "afio":
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/qft0 setblk 5120
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>If you don't want to use <EM>Ftape's</EM> built in compression you can also use
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/qft0 setblk 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to switch <EM>Ftape</EM> to variable block size mode and be able to write the   
data in arbitrary portions to the tape (BUT: the builtin compression doesn't   
work with this setting). When you intend to use "KBackup" then this is the   
only way to make it work together with <EM>Ftape</EM> (it _may_ work, don't know   
if it does)</LI>
<LI>tell your backup program about <EM>Ftape's</EM> default block size of 10k (which   
is also the default of GNU tar). For "afio" you can use the following command   
line switch:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
afio -b 10k ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>You may want to read the section "Tape blocks" of the manual (use its   
"Concept index" to directly jump to that section)
<P>When using GNU tar's builtin compression with GNU tar versions prior to
tar-1.12 one needs to run tar with the <CODE>--block-compress</CODE> switch to
<CODE>re-block</CODE> the output to the tape.  Otherwise tar will compress the data 
it reads, and write it in arbitrary portions to the tape.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Example :

tar -czvf /dev/qft0 --block-compress /etc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>WARNING:</B>
One shouldn't use tar's builtin compression with large backups as it makes the
entire data stream one huge compressed block.  If such archives are corrupted
right at the beginning it will be very difficult to recover.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.9">11.9 I/O errors and FDC - some explanations.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When you get next messages, this could be interesting for you !
<P>
<UL>
<LI>fdc-io.c (ft_handle_perpend) - Your FDC does not support QIC-3020.</LI>
<LI>Cannot write to /dev/qft0: I/O error</LI>
</UL>
<P>The explanations: 
<P>"FDC" menas "Floppy Disk Controller". The
problem is that your floppy disk controller must be able to support
something that is called "perpendicular mode" to be able to read and
write QIC-3020/QIC-3010 cartridges (i.e. TR-3 cartridges). To my
knowledge all FDCs that are capable of at least 1Mbit/sec data
transfer rate also support "perpendicular mode" ("perpendicular"
refers to the direction of magnetization of the ferro-magnetic
particles on the tape).
<P>This means that you need to purchase another FDC. Either look around
some computer stores and ask for an IO controller cards that is able
to support 2.88 Mb floppies (which imlies 1Mbit data transfer rate and
perpendicular mode).
<P>Or get one of the so called "high speed" controllers that even support
2Mbit/sec data transfer rate. Those controllers are based on an Intel
82078 FDC. Iomega sells such a card under the name "Ditto Dash". I
think Exabyte sells their 2Mbit controllers separately, too, whereas
Seagate ships its TR-3 drives (i.e. the TST-3200) together with such a
controller.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.11">11.11 I get "device busy" when I make multiple backups on a tape using some script.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The "device busy" messages can only occur while the <EM>Ftape devices</EM> are   
still held open by some program. As soon as the close() system call has   
completed the busy flag is cleared. May be "bru" or some other program has   
still forked off a child that dies delayed?
<P>Yes, this will reproduce the problem, it seems:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cvvzf /dev/nqft0 --block-compress ; mt rewind
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You can skip the "--block-compress" if using the most recent version  
of GNU tar.
<P>However, this is not a bug of <EM>Ftape</EM>. It seems that the parent tar  
process exits before its child has closed the tape device. I know,  
however, from hacking the tar code ages ago, that tar properly waits  
for its parent to die.
<P>However, the busy message simply means that the "busy" variable is  
still held at 1 (zftape/zftape-init.c). And this simply means that  
there still is a process hanging around that holds the tape device  
open. 
<P>I think I have it (only for the case of tar 'cause I have the source
code.
<P>If on uses tar with compression, then it forks a child which will
become the compressor bei execing  "gzip" or whatever. Before the call
to execlp() the child will fork off a grand child of its parent
tar. That grandchild will do the actual tape I/O.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar - fork() - write to child tar
        |
      child tar - fork() - gzip (will pipe to grand child tar)
                    |
                  grand child tar - open archive.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, parent tar only waits for its child to die. gzip surely doesn't
wait for the grand child as the gzip is a result of an execlp().
<P>What I don't know is whether the grand child should be implicitly
waited for by the parent tar, or if the wait() function also waits for
grand childs.
<P>But this seems to be the problem: the parent tar already has exited
while its grandchild still is busy closing the archive. One hardly
will notice this problem if the close() happens fast (i.e. regular
files, block devices, also other tape devices?), but it isn't a bug in
<EM>Ftape</EM>, but either in the backup programs or in the kernel or maybe
libc exit code.
<P>Don't know if the considerations above also apply to bru. If there is
no grandchild and the parent process properly waits for its childs
then there shouldn't be a problem.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.13">11.13 What block-size should I use with tar ?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When using compression, and in all general, it can be a benefit to  
specify to <CODE>tar</CODE>, that it should block the output into chunks.  
Since <EM>Ftape</EM> cuts things into 29Kbyte blocks, saying `<CODE>-b58</CODE>'  
should be optimum.
<P>"Why 29Kbyte?", I hear you cry.  Well, the QIC-80 standard specifies  
that all data should be protected by an Error Correcting Code (ECC)  
code.  The code specified in the QIC-80 standard is known as a  
Reed-Solomon (R-S) code.  The R-S code takes 29 data bytes and  
generates 3 parity bytes.  To increase the performance of the ECC  
code, the parity bytes are generated across 29 1Kbyte sectors.  Thus,  
<EM>Ftape</EM> takes 29Kbytes of data, adds 3Kbytes of ECC parity, and  
writes 32Kbytes to the tape at a time.  For this reason, <EM>Ftape</EM> will  
always read and write 32K byte blocks to be able to detect (and  
correct) data errors.
<P>If you are curious, and wish to know more, look in the <CODE>ecc.c</CODE> and  
<CODE>ecc.h</CODE> files, for an explanation of the code and a reference to a  
textbook on Reed-Solomon codes.

<P>
<P>It is not bad as such to compress data twice (which would be the case
when using tapers compression together with <EM>zftape's</EM> compression) but
it doesn't make any sense. You won't gain much further compression,

<H2><A NAME="ss11.20">11.20 How does `mt eom' work when you've started overwriting a tape in the middle?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>(EOM is "End Of recorded Media", the position right after all data  
already recorded to the tape)
<P>One cannot use tape "files" like files on an ordinary file system.  
<P>In principle, a tape doesn't allow anything but appending new data at  
EOM.  However, if one positiones just in the middle of the already  
recorded data AND starts writing, then the driver first deletes all  
following files (thus moving the EOM to the actual position) and then  
starts writing.
<P>Thus, the new EOM after finishing the write process, is then after the  
newly recorded data.
<P>One of the consequences of the above is, of course, that writing to  
the tape in the middle of the already recorded area, is destructive in  
the sense, that it not only overwrites the "file" the tape is  
positioned at, but also deletes all following files.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.21">11.21 When I made backups before using taper, under the 2.0.29 ftape my drive didn't support fsf, under the new zftape it does, why would this be, and what exactly is fsf ?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>It probably didn't work before because you didn't use a 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/rft0 erase
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

before writing data to the cartridge. THIS ISN'T necessary any more.
<P>But, hey, what does <I>mt fsf</I>? Tape drives don't store files in the
sense that you can use 
<PRE>
cp somefile /dev/my_what_ever_tape
</PRE>
 
or be able to mount the tape drive like you could mount a harddisk. 
You can't do nothing with a tape drive but write data to it in a sequential 
manner.
<P>As this is quite inconvenient, somebody invented something which is
known under the name <I>file mark</I> or <I>eof mark</I> (eof == End Of
File). Those marks don't separate files that have been backed up to
the tape device, but only separate blocks of data (whatever data that
might be).
<P>Normally, the kernel tape device drivers take care of writing file
marks when the tape device is closed, i.e.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cf /dev/nqft0 /bin
tar -cf /dev/nqft0 /etc
mt -f /dev/nqft0 rewind
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

would result in a backup of all files under <I>/bin</I> and <I>/etc</I>. When
the first <I>tar</I> finishes, the kernel driver will take care of writing
a file mark to the tape at the the current tape position, and when the
second <I>tar</I> process has finished, another file mark is written to the
tape cartridge at that position.
<P>Now, the sense of those file marks is, that it is possible to skip
between different archives on the tape more quickly than would be
possible with reading the data back.
<P>The commands to do that are:
<DL>
<DT><B>mt fsf</B><DD><P>fast skip to the next file mark towards EOT (End Of Tape)
<DT><B>mt bsf</B><DD><P>fast skip to the next file marks towards BOT (Begin Of Tape)
</DL>

Thus, to extract the second archive in the example above, one doesn't
need to read the first archive back, but can proceed as follows:

<H2><A NAME="ss11.22">11.22 What exactly is the difference between ftape, and zftape?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When <EM>Ftape</EM> was young there were two versions of the floppy tape
driver, one of them was called <EM>zftape</EM> because of its built-in
user-transparent on-the-fly compression. Whether such a thing is a
feature or a bug ('cause this needn't be done in kernel space) is
another question. However, the ioctl interface and file mark handling
provided by <EM>zftape</EM> was much better and had less bugs. And <EM>zftape</EM>
allows to use floppy tape cartridges with different OS. Well, you
can't exchange data, but <EM>zftape</EM> won't overwrite volumes created by
your Windoze program, and vice versa.
<P>Nowadays, <EM>Ftape</EM> is name of the entire floppy tape driver package AND
<I>ftape.o</I> is the file-name of the kernel module that implements the
low-level hardware support. <EM>zftape</EM> has ceased to exist as a separate
package, but the new <EM>Ftape</EM> versions (since ftape-3.00) contain a
<EM>zftape.o</EM> module that needs to be loaded on top of <EM>ftape.o</EM>
(i.e. you need to load BOTH modules to be able to access your floppy
tape drive) and implements the file system interface and the advanced
(?) features of the previous verions <EM>zftape</EM>.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.23">11.23 What is the difference between a rewinding, and non rewinding drive?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Well, the rewinding tape devices rewind the tape to BOT (Begin Of
Tape) when the device is closed, i.e.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cvf /dev/qft0 /bin
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will rewind the tape cartridge when the tar job has finished. In contrast, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tar -cvf /dev/nqft0 /bin 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will NOT rewind the tape cartridge and leave the tape R/W head at its
current position.
<P>Rewinding devices should be used when performing a single backup,
non-rewinding devices can be useful when doing multiple backups as one
doesn't need to space to EOM (End Of recorded Media) before appending
another archive.
<P>Non-rewinding devices MUST be used when sending any of the tape motion
command to the tape drive, such as 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/nqft0 fsf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

, because when the <I>mt</I> process finishes then the tape device is closed  
which would result in rewinding the cartridge with the rewinding devices.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.24">11.24 Can someone tell me how to use mt to rewind my TR-3 drive one record using zftape record, so I can verify it?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Well, it depends. If the tape is still positioned inside the volume  
just written, "mt bsf 1" (or equivalently "mt bsf") will backspace  
just to the beginning of that volume (this is how "tar --verify"  
works). If the tape is already positioned AFTER the filemark that  
marks the end of the last written volume, then you need to issue   
"mt bsf 2"
<P>The logic behind this is as follows:
"MTBSF count" backspaces over count file marks, stops, and then  
positions on the <CODE>EOT</CODE> side of the last skipped file mark. This means,  
an "mt bsf 2" will position right at the beginning of the previous  
volume. 
<P>&lt;answer form Claus Heine&gt;
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.25">11.25 By non-rewinding, they mean that it doesn't automatically rewind, correct? It doesn't mean that under no circumstances it will rewind, right?  I tried using /dev/zqft0, and it instantly rewinds the tape.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You are right: auto-rewind means, the tape is rewound when the tape  
device is closed, non-rewinding  means, the tape isn't automatically  
rewound when the tape device is closed (but you can, of course, use  
the tape motion commands BSF/FSF etc. to position the tape head at  
every position you like).
<P>&lt;answer form Claus Heine&gt;
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.26">11.26 What is the difference between what mt considers a record and what it considers a file?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>A record is the minimal amount of bytes that will be accepted by the
tape in one read/write operation (except in "variable block size mode"
where it just should be the amount of data actually written in a
single write operation??). 
<P>For <EM>zftape</EM> every read and write access has to be a multiple of a fixed
block size (fixed, but tunable with <CODE>MTSETBLK</CODE>). This block size is a
"tape record" (as mentioned in the GNU mt man page and defaults to
10kb for <EM>zftape</EM>.
<P>A "file" (in the sense of the mt man page) is a, well, misleading
terminus. What is meant is an area of the tape between two file
marks. This is not a file like a file on the file system, in the sense
that it could have a name, file access modes, could be moved or copied
with cp, mv, rm etc. 
<P>Instead, It simply is the area of the tape that was recorded in one
backup session, its end is marked by a tape file mark, and its
beginning is delimited by either <CODE>BOT</CODE> or the file mark of the previous
tape "file". That tape "files" are the things that can be skipped with
the <CODE>MTBSF/FSF</CODE> commands.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.27">11.27 Reusing tapes with zftape without reformatting the tape.</A>

<P>
<P>We try to answer the followong questions :
<UL>
<LI>Is there a good way to erase, as in remove the data or at least the volumes 
from a tape, without reformating?  </LI>
<LI>Can you overwrite the last volume on a tape with making a mess out of it? </LI>
<LI>Can you overwrite the last several volumes without making a mess? </LI>
<LI>Can you delete the last volume?</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you want to "erase" an entire cartridge, then simply do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mt -f /dev/qft0 erase
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will erase the volume table (i.e. the "file marks").
<P>Pre-ftape-3.x releases of zftape and ftape used to allow overwriting
of already existing volumes on a cartridge. I have removed this
feature as it was reported that it already has caused data-loss with
some backup programs.
<P>If you indeed need to remove some volumes on the tape then you should
use the
