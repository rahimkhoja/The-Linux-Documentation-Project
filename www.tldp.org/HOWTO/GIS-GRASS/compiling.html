      the source code?

      source code to my GIS, so I can see how it works, and maybe fix some 
      things to work the way I like them?"  (You probably know the answers 
      to this question, at least for many commercial software packages.)

      Guide.  You may also want to get the GRASS Programmer's Manual and 
      User's Reference Manual.  To do this:

>      Don't forget this site.  There are several tutorials on some of GRASS' 
      more advanced programs in the pub/grass/grass4.1/document directory.  
      There are two options for source code (I'm only discussing GRASS 
      version 4.14 here, though version 4.15 is also available)  The 
      pub/grass/outgoing directory contains many contributed functions (and 
      many other candidates for enhancing your system).
    </P
><P
>      Follow the README.4 file for installing GRASS version 4.14 (which is 
      sometimes called version 4.1.4) source code.  Follow the README.5 file 
      for installing GRASS version 4.15 (which is sometimes called version 
      4.1.5) source code.
    </P
><P
>      After installing the source code, uncompress and print 
      installGuide.ps.Z (or the troff version, if you prefer that and got it 
      from a neighboring directory).  You might also want to uncompress and 
      print refman.ps.Z and progman.ps.Z at the same time.  Note that 
      progman.ps.Z is called the programmer's manual, but also contains 
      valuable information about data formats and directory structures.  
      Advanced users may also want to know the GRASS system utilities, even 
      if they won't be calling them in code.
    </P
><P
>      Now, use the GRASS Installation Guide (from installGuide.ps.Z) to 
      guide yourself through the installation.  The thickness of this 
      document may at first be intimidating.  However, if you installed 
      Linux yourself, you should be ready to tackle a GRASS installation.  
      Don't be surprised if a function or two does not compile on your 
      system.  I have a couple of uncompiled functions on my own Linux 
      system.  Fortunately, these are functions that I don't use...  Some 
      day I'll get back to them, fix them, and compile them!?
