>      GRASS used to be available on tape from various companies that signed 
      distribution agreements with USA/CERL.  These companies usually 
      supported specific platform environments, such as Masscomp, Sun, DEC, 
      Hewlett Packard, IBM (risc), PC (running some flavor of UNIX), and 
      Macintosh (running AUX).  Until recently, the flavors of UNIX working on 
      PCs generally were too low-end, or required too much added programming 
      support (e.g. programming drivers for high-end graphics boards like the 
      Number Nine boards of several years back) to be stable or complete.  
      However, with robust systems like Linux, this problem is history.  
      Similarly, few people acquire GRASS on tape, though a few do on CD-ROM.

          Baylor has source code for GRASS 4.1 and 4.2, as well as Sun Solaris
          compiled binaries. Blackland GRASS for Windows 95/NT is linked to 
          from this site.  Baylor is considering its own Linux and Windows NT
          binaries, as well.  You should be able to compile the Baylor 
          source code under Linux yourself, using information in this mini-HOWTO.

>          Linux distribution developers!  Might you be interested in including 
          GRASS with your distribution?  Remember, GRASS source code is in the 
          completely unrestricted, copyright-free, public domain.  Your 
          distribution might be more valuable if it contained source code and/or 
          compiled binaries for GRASS.
