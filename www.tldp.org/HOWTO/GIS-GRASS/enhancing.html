>      GRASS has been developed for over a decade as completely unrestricted 
      public domain source code and executables.  Though there was initial 
      resistance to the existence of such robust software in the public 
      domain, many competitors learned to take advantage of GRASS.  It has 
      reputedly been the intellectual stimulus for several enhancements to 
      other GISs.  Several companies conducted business by installing and 
      customizing public domain GRASS for customers, and by providing other 
      value-added services such as data base development.

>      As USA/CERL no longer supports the public version of GRASS, users are 
      free to use what currently exists.  They're also currently completely 
      on their own.  At least where the public domain version is concerned.

      adapted from the public domain
      version by Logiciels et Applications Scientifiques (L.A.S) Inc. of 
      Montreal.  In a recent check, LAS 
      sold its GRASSLAND for Sun, Linux and Windows NT.  LAS is trying to 
      encourage the continuation of a robust public domain Linux, partly as 
      a source of new ideas and code for their own developments.
