>      There are many ways to describe a Geographic Information System.  Here 
      are three working definitions (from David A. Hastings, 1992, Geographic 
      Information Systems: A Tool for Geoscience Analysis and Interpretation):

>          (The minimal definition):  A GIS is a hardware/software system 
          for the storage, management, and (with hardcopy or screen 
          graphic) selective retrieval capabilities of georeferenced data.  
          Definitions like this one are often used by vendors and users of 
          vector-only GIS, whose objective is sophisticated management and 
          output of cartographic data.

>          (A parallel definition): A GIS is a hardware/software system for 
          managing and displaying spatial data.  It is similar to a 
          traditional Data Base Management System, where we now think in 
          <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>spatial</I
> rather than in tabular terms, and where the 
          "report writer" now allows output of maps as well as of tables 
          and numbers.  Thus we can consider a GIS a "spatial DBMS" as 
          opposed to traditional "tabular DBMSs."  Few people use this 
          definition, but it might help to explain GIS to a DBMS user.

>          (A more aggressive definition): A GIS is a system of hardware, 
          software, and data that facilitates the development, 
          enhancement, modeling, and display of multivariate (e.g. 
          multilayered) spatially referenced data.  It performs some 
          analytical functions itself, and by its analysis, selective 
          retrieval and display capabilities, helps the user to further 
          analyze and interpret the data.  Properly configured, the GIS 
          can model (e.g. synthetically recreate) a feature or phenomenon 
          as a function of other features or phenomena which may be 
          related - where all features or phenomena are represented 
          (characterized) by spatial and related tabular data.  The 
          analytical objectives described here are sometimes controversial 
          - and often given lip service by cartographic GIS specialists 
          who have not yet seen what can be accomplished scientifically by 
          a select few GISs that go beyond cartographic approaches.
