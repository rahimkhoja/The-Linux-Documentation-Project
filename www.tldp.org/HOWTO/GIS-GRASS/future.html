>          USA/CERL's announced intention is to use GRASS and COTS (commercial 
          off-the-shelf software) for internal uses, to leave the GRASS 
          public web- and ftp-site on its system indefinitely, and to sign 
          cooperative research and development agreements with three 
          companies: (1) the Environmental Sciences Research Institute 
          (ESRI), (2) Intergraph, and (3) Logiciels et Applications 
          Scientifiques (L.A.S.) Inc.  The first two agreements encouraged 
          the incorporation of GRASS concepts into ESRI's and Intergraph's 
          commercial GISs.  The third encouraged the adaptation of GRASS' 
          concepts and code into a new commercial GIS by L.A.S.  L.A.S. also 
          offered to encourage the continuation of a public domain GRASS, as 
          a viable stand-alone system and as a potential source of new ideas 
          and code for L.A.S.'s GRASSLAND.  One observer noted that the first 
          two agreements might be akin to someone signing Linux over to 
          Microsoft.  The same observer considers the experiment by/with 
          L.A.S. to be an interesting possibility - an attempt to keep viable 
          public domain and commercial versions of GRASS.

>          Some people believe that GRASS will wither without USA/CERL's 
          central management.  Some believe that the Open GIS Consortium will 
          successfully guide industry into an open architecture that will 
          benefit all developers and users.  Others believe that OGIS' effort 
          will lead to a cacophony of almost similar (but not quite 
          interoperable) vendor-specific "standards," so the loss of GRASS as 
          an open development platform will be felt sorely.

>          Some people believe that developments on some campuses and other 
          sites may result in those institutes keeping GRASS for awhile, but 
          in non-standard forms.  In short, GRASS will undergo "cell 
          division" and lead to a cacophony of internally valuable, but 
          externally unused, GISs.

>              Clearly the topics are a bit tongue-in-cheek.  However, under this 
              model, a Central Committee (including representation of academic, 
              public service [government and nongovernmental organizations], 
              commercial distributors and value added firms, programmers, and 
              users) would guide overall grass development and testing.  The 
              other special interest groups would serve their user communities.  
              Academics, for example, would involve GIS and GRASS education, but 
              would also try to pull GRASS development in its direction.  Value 
              added commercial developers would serve their own interests, 
              including trying to pull GRASS development in a direction that 
              would help their businesses.  Users would help each other learn 
              GRASS, develop workarounds to bugs, etc.

>          Use as a scientific, as well as a traditional graphically oriented 
          GIS.  Many GISs can make pretty maps.  Many of those GISs cannot 
          easily perform certain scientific analytical functions as easily or 
          powerfully as GRASS.  GRASS was designed and developed in response 
          to a perceived need for scientific GIS, specifically for 
          environmental analysis, and the environmental management/protection 
          of public lands.  Incidentally, there is at least one Web-based 
          GRASS version.

>          Education.  GRASS is easier to teach and learn than some other 
          GISs.  It is easier to modify (for those that want to learn GIS as 
          computer science, rather than as "geography") than most other GISs 
          that come without source code and treat the program as a magical 
          black box.  And, of course, it is more affordable for the student 
          of GIS than many other GISs.

>          Applications research and development.  Many universities have used 
          GRASS.  Its available source code, easy modification, easy 
          scriptability, etc., give it distinct advantages over some more 
          closed systems.

>          Public Service.  GRASS has been used as a scientific GIS for many 
          public service applications.  There is considerable value in 
          continuing a robust GIS that can ba packaged with any UNIX 
          workstation.  There is considerably more value if that UNIX 
          workstation universe can include Linux (but is not constrained only 
          to Linux).

>      Who would be the Linus Torvalds equivalent in this management model?  
      Perhaps no single person.  I have been involved in GRASS for about a 
      decade, when GRASS was the only GIS that satisfied my needs in 
      scientific data management and GIS application.  Indeed, I had been a 
      dedicated avoider of the user-unfriendly UNIX environment until GRASS 
      forced me to learn it.  Several senior GRASS developers are active in 
      GRASS-related activities and would like to see the continued vitality of 
      an open GRASS.  It's likely that a reborn GRASS would attract a new crop 
      of friends.  Thus the concept of a "Central Committee" to collectively 
      lead GRASS' transition to a more open management and development style.
    </P
><P
>      In short, the Linux community has an opportunity to take under its wing 
      a killer ap.  GRASS' current public domain status is slightly different 
      from Linux's.  However, that status could be discussed....
