<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P> Bzip2 is a groovy new algorithm for compressing data.  It generally
makes files that are 60-70% of the size of their gzip'd counterparts.
<P>
<P> This document will take you through a few common applications for bzip2.
<P>
<P> Future versions of the document will have applications of
libbzip2, the bzip2 C library which bzip2's author,
<A HREF="mailto:Julian_Seward@muraroa.demon.co.uk">Julian Seward</A> has kindly written.  The bzip2 manual, which includes
low-level information about the library, can be found 
<A HREF="http://www.bzip2.org/bzip2/docs/manual_toc.html">here</A>.
<P>
<P> Future versions of the document may also include a summary of the
discussion over whether (and how) bzip2 should be used in the Linux kernel.
