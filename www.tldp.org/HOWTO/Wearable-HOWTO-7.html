<P>
<P>Sulawesi:  An intelligent user interface system for ubquitous computing.
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Background</A>
</H2>

<P>A few years ago, wearable computers were dedicated systems constructed
by and for a single person. The machine was customised to suit the owners
personal preferences using alternative input/output devices to achieve
different interaction techniques, and until now most of the interfaces
used on these machines have been an amalgamation of existing desktop user
interface systems and novel input/output devices.
<P>The ideal human-computer interface for use in a mobile/ubiquitous environment
would be one which listens for its user, understands what the user has
asked it to do using speech recognition, gestures, machine vision and other
channels of information, carried out the users request automatically, and
presented the results back to the user when it is most appropriate and
in a suitable format. For example; a machine which could monitor the users
respiratory levels, heart rate and movement, the user could ask ``when
I fall asleep could you turn off those &lt;user pointing> lights''. This
type of interaction with a mobile device or an ubiquitous environment,
using spoken sentences and gestures, fall under the category of multi-modal
and intelligent user interfaces; and Sulawesi is a framework which provides
a basic multimodal development system.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 The Sulawesi Architecture</A>
</H2>

<P>The Sulawesi system that has been designed comprises of three distinct
parts,
<UL>
<LI>An input stage, which gathers raw data from the various sensors.</LI>
<LI>A core stage, which contains a natural language processing module and service
agents.</LI>
<LI>An output stage, which decides how to render the results from the service
agents.</LI>
</UL>

Programming API's allow third partys to create new input, service and output
modules and integrate them with Sulawesi.
<H3>The input stage</H3>

<P>The system gathers real world information through a well defined API. The
current implementation includes a keyboard input, a network input, a speech
recognition input, a video camera input, a G.P.S. input and infra-red input.
The inputs do not do any pre-processing of the data, they only provide
the raw data to the core of the system for interpretation by the services
within.
<P>
<H3>The core stage</H3>

<P>The core of the system contains a basic natural language processor which
performs sentence translations. This converts a sentence into a command
stream from which two pieces of information are extracted, which service
to invoke and how the output should be rendered. A service manager is responsible
for the instantiation and monitoring of the services, it also checkpoints
commands to try and provide some kind of resiliance against system failures.
The services produce, where possible, a modal neutral output which can
be send to the output stage for processing.
<P>
<H3>The output stage</H3>

<P>The output stage takes a modal neutral result from a service and makes
a decision on how to render the information. The decision is made based
on two criteria, what the user has asked for, and how the system percieves
the users current context/environment.
<P>If the user has asked to be shown a piece of information, this implies
a visual rendition. If the system detects that the user is moving at speed
(through the input sensors) an assumption can be made that the user attention
might be distracted if a screen with the results in is displayed in front
of them. (imagine what would happen if the user was driving!).. In this
case the system will override the users request and would redirect the
results to a more suitable renderer, such as speech.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Sentence translations</A>
</H2>

<P>When humans recognise speech they do not understand every word in a sentence,
sometimes words are misheard or a distraction prevents the whole sentence
from being heard. A human can infer what has been said from the other words
around the ones missed in a sentence, this is not always sucessfull but
in most cases it is satisfactory for the understanding of a conversation.
This type of sentence decoding has been called semi-natural language processing
and has been implemented using a few basic rules, the example below explains
how the system converts human understandable sentences into commands that
the system understands :
<UL>
<LI><CODE>could you show me what the time is</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>I would like you to tell me the time</CODE></LI>
</UL>

It can be argued that in practice these sentences result in similar information
being relayed to a user. The request is for the machines interpretation
of the time to be sent to an appropriate output channel, the result is
the user receiving the knowledge of what the time is. Closer inspection
reveals that almost all the data in the sentences can be thrown away and
the request can still be inferred from the resulting information.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>show time</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>tell time</CODE></LI>
</UL>

In the example above there has been a reduction to 1/4 and 2/9 of the number
of words (data) in the sentences, while it can be argued that close to
100% of the information content is still intact.
<P>The system implemented allows sentences to be processed and interpreted.
The semi-natural language processing is achieved through a self generated
lookup table of services and a language transformation table.
<P>The service names have to be unique (due to the restrictions on the
file system) and this provides a simple mechanism to match a service such
as ``time'' within a sentence. It is impractical and almost impossible
to hard code all predefined language transformations, and such a system
would not be easily adaptable to diverse situations. The use of lookup
tables provides a small and efficient way in which a user can customise
the system to their own personal preferences without having to re-program
or re-compile the sentence understanding code. The system knows what the
words '<CODE>show</CODE>' and '<CODE>tell</CODE>' mean in the sentences by referring
to the lookup table to determine which output renderer the results should
be sent to.
<P>Example of a lookup file.
<PRE>
|tell|speak| 
|read|speak| 
|show|text| 
|display|text| 
|EOF| 
</PRE>

The top entry in this lookup table specifies that the first time the
word "say" is encountered in a sentence the results of the service should
be sent to the "speak" output renderer.
<P>The use of lookup tables inherently restricts the use of sentences,
in order to create a sentence which is to be understood the following rule
must be adhered to.
<PRE>
&lt;render type> &lt;service name> &lt;service arguments> 
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Summary</A>
</H2>

<P>The above system enables a sentence like ``I would like you to turn the
lights on when it gets dark''. The system interprets the sentence as a
request to invoke the `light' service and to render the output using some
kind of light controller device to turn on or off the lights. There are
two points which need to be emphasised here, the first is on the machine
inferring a meaning from a relatively natural sentence rather than the
user having to adapt to the machine and remember complex commands or manipulate
a user interface. The second is on the machine being asked to perform a
certain task when certain conditions are met in the real world, ``when
it gets dark'' requests that when the computers interpretation of the current
lighting conditions cross a certain threshold, it should respond and send
a message to the light controller output.
<P>The Sulawesi system provides the flexability to achieve this type of
interaction but it does not provide the underlying mechanisms for controlling
lighting circuits, that's the part you have to code up ;)..
