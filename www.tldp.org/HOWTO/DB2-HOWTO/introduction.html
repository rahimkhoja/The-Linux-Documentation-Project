>1.1. Who should read this HOWTO</H2
><P
>This HOWTO is intended for anyone interested in installing and
    using IBM DB2® Express-C 9 on a Linux® distribution. The goal is
    to include as many distributions as possible, on both 32&#8211;bit and
    64&#8211;bit architectures, however both hardware and time resources are
    constrained, so if you come across a distribution/architecture combination
    that isn't covered in here or if you encounter a problem that isn't
    addressed, send a note to db2howto@gmail.com and I'll try to help verify or
    resolve your issue and add the information here.</P
><P
>The information found in this document is based on personal experiences
    installing and configuring IBM DB2 9 Express-C.</P

><P
>Ian Hakes, has worked for IBM DB2 since 1999. Currently,
    he is involved in technical marketing for the DB2 Express-C product,
    developing technical documentation and evangelizing DB2 Express-C.
    Before that, he was the technical team lead for the DB2 Information

    Reference manual. His free time is spent mainly typing on computers,
    thinking about how much nicer it would be to watch a movie or to be
    sailing.</P
