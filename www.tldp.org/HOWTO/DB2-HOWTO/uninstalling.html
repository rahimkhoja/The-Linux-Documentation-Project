>19. Removing DB2 Express-C</H1
><P
>Uninstalling DB2 Express-C is a bit more detailed than the installation
  process. Unfortunately, at this time, there is no GUI-based uninstaller
  utility like there is for installation. Follow the steps below to completely
  remove the DB2 Express-C software from your system. Since the database files
  are kept in the home directory of the instance user, you can keep the database
  files by skipping the removal of the instance owner (the last step).</P

>Remove the Database Administration Server. Switch to the DAS owner
      (dasusr1 by default), either through the <B
CLASS="command"
>su - dasusr1</B
>
      command or by logging in to the system directly as the DAS user, and issue
      the command <B
CLASS="command"
>db2admin stop</B
>. Then switch to the root
      user, and issue the 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>/opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/instance/dasdrop</B
> command.</P

>Remove the DB2 instance(s). Switch to the instance owner
      (db2inst1 by default), either through the <B

>
      command or by logging in to the system directly as the instance user, and
      issue the command <B
CLASS="command"
>db2stop</B

      instance by issuing the <B
CLASS="command"
>/opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/instance/db2idrop
      db2_instance</B
> command, where <TT
CLASS="varname"
>db2_instance</TT
>
      refers to the actual instance name you want to drop (for example,
      /opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/instance/db2idrop db2inst1). If you want to verify which
      instances are present on your system, run the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>/opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/instance/db2ilist</B
> command.</P

>Remove the software installation. As root, run the

      remove the installation of DB2 from your system.</P
