<P>I believe that the majority of security and ease of use issues are dealt with by the technologies I have described here.  Certainly there are many issues that this technology could expose (mostly internal political or policy issues within your own institution). </P>
<P>If you discover any flaws in the technology.  Please contact me about it.</P>
<P>Also, if you can explain the proper pf rules to get *bsd to properly forward (masquerade the 10. network) packets to Internet-routed network segments on the internal side of the VPN, I would definitely like to hear from you.  I could not get it to work, whereas the Linux masquerading rule I found just works.</P>
