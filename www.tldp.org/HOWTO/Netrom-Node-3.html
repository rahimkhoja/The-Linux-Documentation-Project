<P>Below is a list of all the applications and files that are
needed to set up a working ax.25 system. The Applications are all in
the /usr/sbin/ directory and the Configuration files are in the
/etc/ax25/ directory. Note: Kissattach is used only if you have TNC's
in the Kiss Mode.

<P>There are several names that a ax25-util user must invent.
Since this paper uses the files of k5di, a listing of those names can
be made.

It's a good idea to make a list like this on paper before you
start to change things. It is easy to put the wrong name in a control
file. 
<P>Kissattach is an application that connects the kernel
to the TNC, sets the tcp/ip address up, sets the speed of the
connection, and is given the serial port to use.
<P>Axports is a file that defines the name of the ax.25 ports
and tells kissattach what call-sign, baud-rate and window size to use.
Below is an example of a 2 TNC system.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/ax25/axports
# Be very careful with the speed setting. This is the speed in
# bits/second that data passes from the computer to the TNC, and has
# nothing to do with the radio baud rate! 
#
# The format of this file is:
#
# name call-sign speed paclen window description
#
ax0     K5DI-9          9600    255     3       445.1 (9600 bps)
ax1     K5DI-10         9600    255     1       145.07 (1200 bps)

<P>AX25D is the application that reads the ax25d.conf
Configuration file and answers calls made to the system. Below is a
sample ax25d.conf that has no Netrom defined. In fact all it will do
is answer calls to k5di-9 and k5di-10. When it answers it starts the
node application and logs the caller in.  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf
#
#  AX25D Configuration File.
#
# AX.25 ports begin with a '['.
#
[k5di-4 VIA ax0]
default  * *    *   *   *    0 - root   /usr/sbin/node  node 
[k5di-4 VIA ax1]
default  * *    *   *   *     0 - root  /usr/sbin/node  node 
#
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The next step is to get ax25d to answer a call to the alias
CRUCES as well as the call-sign. This is easy to do and is shown
below:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

# /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf
#
#  AX25D Configuration File.
#
# AX.25 ports begin with a '['.
#
[CRUCES VIA ax0]
default  * *    *   *   *    0 - root   /usr/sbin/node  node
[k5di-4 VIA ax0]
default  * *    *   *   *    0 - root   /usr/sbin/node  node 
[CRUCES VIA ax1]
default  * *    *   *   *    0 - root   /usr/sbin/node  node
[k5di-4 VIA ax1]
default  * *    *   *   *     0 - root  /usr/sbin/node  node 
#

<P>If you have trouble, as root kill ax25d if it is running and
then at the prompt type ax25d &amp;. As ax25d loads the ax25d.conf file
it will print out any errors it finds. This print out is very accurate
and tells you which row in the file is wrong. 
<P>A connect from any adjacent node to k5di-4 or CRUCES will
connect to the k5di node. But Netrom is not transmitting a node
listing for CRUCES or k5di-4. This is done by changing some Netrom
Configuration files.
