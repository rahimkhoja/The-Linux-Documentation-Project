<P>Should you still need assistance, you may wish to check the squid FAQ or
the squid mailing list at www.squid-cache.org. You may also e-mail me at 
drk@unxsoft.com, and I'll try to answer your questions if time permits (sometimes 
it does, but sometimes it doesn't).  Please, please, please, send the output of
``iptables -t nat -L'' and relavent portions of any configuration files in your
e-mail, or else I will probably not be able to help you out much.  And please
make sure you've read the whole HOWTO before asking a question.
Regrettably, even though this document has been translated to many
different languages, I can only answer questions asked in English.
