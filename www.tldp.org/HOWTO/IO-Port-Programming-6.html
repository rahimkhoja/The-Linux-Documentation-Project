<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Some useful ports</A></H2>

<P>Here is some programming information for common ports that can be directly
used for general-purpose TTL (or CMOS) logic I/O.
<P>If you want to use these or other common ports for their intended
purpose (e.g., to control a normal printer or modem), you should most
likely use existing drivers (which are usually included in the kernel)
instead of programming the ports directly as this HOWTO describes.
This section is intended for those people who want to connect LCD
displays, stepper motors, or other custom electronics to a PC's
standard ports.
<P>If you want to control a mass-market device like a scanner (that has
been on the market for a while), look for an existing Linux driver for
it. The 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO">Hardware-HOWTO</A> is a good place to start.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/">http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/</A> is a good source for
more information on connecting devices to computers (and on
electronics in general).

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 The parallel port</A>
</H2>

<P>The parallel port's base address (called ``<CODE>BASE</CODE>'' below) is 0x3bc
for <CODE>/dev/lp0</CODE>, 0x378 for <CODE>/dev/lp1</CODE>, and 0x278 for
<CODE>/dev/lp2</CODE>. If you only want to control something that acts like
a normal printer, see the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Printing-HOWTO">Printing-HOWTO</A>.
<P>In addition to the standard output-only mode described below, there is
an `extended' bidirectional mode in most parallel ports. For
information on this and the newer ECP/EPP modes (and the IEEE 1284
standard in general), see 
<A HREF="http://www.fapo.com/">http://www.fapo.com/</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.senet.com.au/~cpeacock/parallel.htm">http://www.senet.com.au/~cpeacock/parallel.htm</A>. Remember
that since you cannot use IRQs or DMA in a user-mode program, you will
probably have to write a kernel driver to use ECP/EPP; I think someone
is writing such a driver, but I don't know the details.
<P>The port <CODE>BASE+0</CODE> (Data port) controls the data signals of the port (D0
to D7 for bits 0 to 7, respectively; states: 0 = low (0 V), 1 = high
(5 V)). A write to this port latches the data on the pins. A read
returns the data last written in standard or extended write mode, or
the data in the pins from another device in extended read mode.
<P>The port <CODE>BASE+1</CODE> (Status port) is read-only, and returns the state
of the following input signals:
<UL>
<LI>Bits 0 and 1 are reserved.</LI>
<LI>Bit 2 IRQ status (not a pin, I don't know how this works)</LI>
<LI>Bit 3 ERROR (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 4 SLCT (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 5 PE (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 6 ACK (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 7 -BUSY (0=high)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The port <CODE>BASE+2</CODE> (Control port) is write-only (a read returns the
data last written), and controls the following status signals:
<UL>
<LI>Bit 0 -STROBE (0=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 1 -AUTO_FD_XT (0=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 2 INIT (1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 3 -SLCT_IN (0=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 4 enables the parallel port IRQ (which occurs on the
low-to-high transition of ACK) when set to 1.</LI>
<LI>Bit 5 controls the extended mode direction (0 = write, 1 =
read), and is completely write-only (a read returns nothing
useful for this bit).</LI>
<LI>Bits 6 and 7 are reserved.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Pinout (a 25-pin female D-shell connector on the port) (i=input, o=output):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
1io -STROBE, 2io D0, 3io D1, 4io D2, 5io D3, 6io D4, 7io D5, 8io D6,
9io D7, 10i ACK, 11i -BUSY, 12i PE, 13i SLCT, 14o -AUTO_FD_XT,
15i ERROR, 16o INIT, 17o -SLCT_IN, 18-25 Ground
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The IBM specifications say that pins 1, 14, 16, and 17 (the control
outputs) have open collector drivers pulled to 5 V through 4.7 kiloohm
resistors (sink 20 mA, source 0.55 mA, high-level output 5.0 V minus
pullup). The rest of the pins sink 24 mA, source 15 mA, and their
high-level output is min. 2.4 V. The low state for both is max. 0.5 V.
Non-IBM parallel ports probably deviate from this standard. For more
information on this, see 
<A HREF="http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/lptpower.html">http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/lptpower.html</A>.
<P>Finally, a warning: Be careful with grounding. I've broken several
parallel ports by connecting to them while the computer is turned
on. It might be a good thing to use a parallel port not integrated on
the motherboard for things like this. (You can usually get a second
parallel port for your machine with a cheap standard `multi-I/O' card;
just disable the ports that you don't need, and set the parallel port
I/O address on the card to a free address. You don't need to care
about the parallel port IRQ if you don't use it.)

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 The game (joystick) port</A>
</H2>

<P>The game port is located at port addresses 0x200-0x207. If you want to
control normal joysticks, you're probably better off using the drivers
distributed with the Linux kernel.
<P>Pinout (a 15-pin female D-shell connector on the port):
<UL>
<LI>1,8,9,15: +5 V (power)</LI>
<LI>4,5,12: Ground</LI>
<LI>2,7,10,14: Digital inputs BA1, BA2, BB1, and BB2, respectively</LI>
<LI>3,6,11,13: ``Analog'' inputs AX, AY, BX, and BY, respectively</LI>
</UL>
<P>The +5 V pins seem to often be connected directly to the power lines
in the motherboard, so they may be able to source quite a lot of
power, depending on the motherboard, power supply and game port.
<P>The digital inputs are used for the buttons of the two joysticks
(joystick A and joystick B, with two buttons each) that you can
connect to the port. They should be normal TTL-level inputs, and you
can read their status directly from the status port (see below). A
real joystick returns a low (0 V) status when the button is pressed
and a high (the 5 V from the power pins through an 1 Kohm resistor)
status otherwise.
<P>The so-called analog inputs actually measure resistance. The game port
has a quad one-shot multivibrator (a 558 chip) connected to the four
inputs. In each input, there is a 2.2 Kohm resistor between the input
pin and the multivibrator output, and a 0.01 uF timing capacitor
between the multivibrator output and the ground. A real joystick has a
potentiometer for each axis (X and Y), wired between +5 V and the
appropriate input pin (AX or AY for joystick A, or BX or BY for
joystick B).
<P>The multivibrator, when activated, sets its output lines high (5 V)
and waits for each timing capacitor to reach 3.3 V before lowering the
respective output line. Thus the high period duration of the
multivibrator is proportional to the resistance of the potentiometer
in the joystick (i.e., the position of the joystick in the appropriate
axis), as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
R = (t - 24.2) / 0.011,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

where R is the resistance (ohms) of the potentiometer and t the high
period duration (microseconds).
<P>Thus, to read the analog inputs, you first activate the multivibrator
(with a port write; see below), then poll the state of the four axes
(with repeated port reads) until they drop from high to low state,
measuring their high period duration. This polling uses quite a lot of
CPU time, and on a non-realtime multitasking system like (normal
user-mode) Linux, the result is not very accurate because you cannot
poll the port constantly (unless you use a kernel-level driver and
disable interrupts while polling, but this wastes even more CPU
time). If you know that the signal is going to take a long time (tens
of ms) to go down, you can call usleep() before polling to give CPU
time to other processes.
<P>The only I/O port you need to access is port 0x201 (the other ports
either behave identically or do nothing). Any write to this port (it
doesn't matter what you write) activates the multivibrator. A read
from this port returns the state of the input signals:
<UL>
<LI>Bit 0: AX (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 1: AY (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 2: BX (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 3: BY (status (1=high) of the multivibrator output)</LI>
<LI>Bit 4: BA1 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 5: BA2 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 6: BB1 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
<LI>Bit 7: BB2 (digital input, 1=high)</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 The serial port</A>
</H2>

<P>If the device you're talking to supports something resembling RS-232,
you should be able to use the serial port to talk to it. The Linux
serial driver should be enough for almost all applications (you
shouldn't have to program the serial port directly, and you'd probably
have to write a kernel driver to do it); it is quite versatile, so
using non-standard bps rates and so on shouldn't be a problem.
<P>See the <CODE>termios(3)</CODE> manual page, the serial driver source code
(<CODE>linux/drivers/char/serial.c</CODE>), and 
<A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/">http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/</A> for more
information on programming serial ports on Unix systems.
