<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Understanding Firewalls</A></H2>

<P>A firewall is a structure intended to keep a fire from spreading.  Building have firewalls made of brick walls completely dividing sections of the building. In a car a firewall is the metal wall separating the engine and passenger compartments.
<P>Internet firewalls are intended to keep the flames of Internet hell out of your private LAN. Or, to keep the members of your LAN pure and chaste by denying them access the all the evil Internet temptations. ;-)
<P>The first computer firewall was a non-routing Unix host with connections to two different networks. One network card connected to the Internet and the other to the private LAN. To reach the Internet from the private network, you had to logon to the firewall (Unix) server.  You then used the resources of the system to access the Internet. For example, you could use X-windows to run Netscape's browser on the firewall system and have the display on your work station. With the browser running on the firewall it has access to both networks.
<P>This sort of dual homed system (a system with two network connections) is great if you can TRUST ALL of your users. You can simple setup a Linux system and give an account accounts on it to everyone needing Internet access. With this setup, the only computer on your private network that knows anything about the outside world is the firewall. No one can download to their personal workstations. They must first download a file to the firewall and then download the file from the firewall to their workstation. 
<P>BIG NOTE: 99% of all break-ins start with gaining account level access on the system being attacked.  Because of this I don't recommend this type of firewall.  It is also very limiting.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Firewall Politics</A>
</H2>

<P> 
You shouldn't believe a firewall machine is all you need.  <EM>Set policies first</EM>.
<P>Firewalls are used for two purposes. 
<P>
<OL>
<LI> to keep people (worms / crackers) out. </LI>
<LI> to keep people (employees / children) in. </LI>
</OL>
<P>When I started working on firewalls I was surprised to learn the company I worked for were more interested in &quot;spying&quot; on their employees then keeping crackers out of their networks.
<P>At least in my state (Oklahoma) employers have the right to monitor phone calls and Internet activity as long as they inform the employees they are doing it.
<P>Big Brother is not government. Big Brother = Big Business. 
<P>Don't get me wrong. People should work, not play at work. And I feel the work ethic has been eroding.  However, I have also observed that management types are the biggest abusers of the rules they set. I have seen hourly workers reprimanded for using the Internet to looking for bus routesto get to work while the same manager used hours of work time looking for fine restaurants and nightclubs to take prospective customers.
<P>My fix for this type of abuse is to publish the firewall logs on a Web page for everyone to see.
<P>The security business can be scary. If you are the firewall manager, watch your back. 
<P>
<H3>How it create a security policy</H3>

<P>I have seen some realy high folutin documentation on how to create a security policy.  After many years of experence I know now say, don't believe a word of them. Create a security policy is simple.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> describe what you need to service</LI>
<LI> describe the group of people you need to service</LI>
<LI> describe which service each group needs access to</LI>
<LI> for each service group describe how the service should be keep secure</LI>
<LI> write a statment making all other forms of access a vialation</LI>
</OL>
<P>Your policy will become more complicated with time but don't try to cover to much ground now.  Make it simple and clear.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Types of Firewalls</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two types of firewalls.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Filtering Firewalls - that block selected network packets. </LI>
<LI>Proxy Servers (sometimes called firewalls) - that make network 
connections for you.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Packet Filtering Firewalls</H3>

<P>Packet Filtering is the type of firewall built into the Linux kernel.
<P>A filtering firewall works at the network level. Data is only allowed to leave the system if the firewall rules allow it.  As packets arrive they are filtered by their type, source address, destination address, and port information contained in each packet.
<P>Many network routers have the ability to perform some firewall services. Filtering firewalls can be thought of as a type of router. Because of this you need a deep understanding of IP packet structure to work with one.
<P>Because very little data is analyzed and logged, filtering firewalls take less CPU and create less latency in your network.
<P>Filtering firewalls do not provide for password controls. User can not identify themselves. The only identity a user has is the IP number assigned to their workstation. This can be a problem if you are going to use DHCP (Dynamic IP assignments). This is because rules are based on IP numbers you will have to adjust the rules as new IP numbers are assigned.  I don't know how to automate this process. 
<P>Filtering firewalls are more transparent to the user.  The user does not have to setup rules in their applications to use the Internet. With most proxy servers this is not true.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Proxy Servers</H3>

<P> 
Proxies are mostly used to control, or monitor, outbound traffic. Some application proxies cache the requested data. This lowers bandwidth requirements and decreases the access the same data for the next user.  It also gives unquestionable evidence of what was transferred.
<P>There are two types of proxy servers. 
<OL>
<LI>Application Proxies - that do the work for you.</LI>
<LI>SOCKS Proxies  - that cross wire ports.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Application Proxy</H3>

<P>The best example is a person telneting to another computer and then telneting from there to the outside world. With a application proxy server the process is automated. As you telnet to the outside world the 
client send you to the proxy first. The proxy then connects to the server you requested (the outside world) and returns the data to you.
<P>Because proxy servers are handling all the communications, they can log everything they (you) do. For HTTP (web) proxies this includes very URL they you see.  For FTP proxies this includes every file you download. They can even filter out &quot;inappropriate&quot; words from the sites you visit or scan for viruses.
<P>Application proxy servers can authenticate users. Before a connection to the outside is made, the server can ask the user to login first. To a web user this would make every site look like it required a login.
<P>
<P>
<H3>SOCKS Proxy</H3>

<P> 
A SOCKS server is a lot like an old switch board.  It simply cross wires your connection through the system to another outside connection.  
<P>Most SOCKS server only work with TCP type connections.  And like filtering firewalls they don't provide for user authentication. They can however record where each user connected to.
