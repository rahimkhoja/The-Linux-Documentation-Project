>The first step is to change your kernel so that it knows you
				have a BocaBoard. Unfortunately, this is not a part of the configure script;
				you must go in and modify the source by hand. In the older versions of the
				kernel, this consists of putting the following line at the beginning of

>At least to me, digging into my kernel and re-compiling it was
				quite a stressful venture! Relax; as long as you copy it to a floppy, your new
				kernel is completely harmless. It won't bite! Honest! :-)</P

>Once you have compiled your new kernel, switch off the machine
				and install the card. Then, turn your machine on with the new kernel floppy in
				the drive. If the installation succeeded, you should see all sorts of strange
				stuff about 16550 UARTS being connected to ttyS16-ttyS32. The system will then
				come up normally.</P
><P
>The odds are pretty good that you don't actually have entries in
				<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev </TT
>for those lines. Remember that they start at 16 and go on to 32. If you
				look at the source code, you'll see why; support for other cards is included in
				the code for lower line numbers. Creating them is pretty simple, once you know
				the trick. </P

>n = 64 + {line number}. The C indicates that this is a character
				mode device. For example, to create the first couple of lines on your board,
				type:

><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>#mknod /dev/ttySxx c 5 n</PRE

></TD

></TABLE
><P
>It is recommended that you create both dial in and dial out
				lines for each port, so that you have maximum flexibility. It turns out to be
				very handy to call another line of your system by activating one of your lines
				as dial-out and calling your main number. I've done this already and it works
				great! It's most useful for checking how things look "on the other side of the
				fence"; I used it to find out how my software looked at 2400bps. (It's slower
				than the Linux console. A LOT slower, in fact).</P
><P
>Once you've finished with this, you can add entries to your
				<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>inittab</TT
> file in the same way as you would for a standard ttySx entry, and the
				modems or terminals should come up!</P
