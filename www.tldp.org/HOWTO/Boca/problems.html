>If you have problems, you may find that this is due to conflicts

>Is the kernel recognising the board? (i.e. Right at the start of
				the boot process, all sixteen ports should be listed on screen with ttySxx, I/O
				Port, and IRQ identified.) Also, 
				<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setserial -bg ttyS*</B
> should list *every* port in
				your system.</P
><P
>By default, the BB2016 is configured to use IO Ports between
				0100 and 017f. This creates problems on systems with two IDE controllers. The
				second controller, ide1, uses 0170-0177 which falls into this range. Big
				problems!!!</P
><P
>So, the solution, in my cases, is to go with an IO base of 0200
				through 027f. I haven't had any conflicts in this region; however, you may want
				to check you system to be sure. (run 
				<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cat /proc/ioports</B
> - better run 
				<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cat /proc/interrupts</B
> to make sure IRQ 12 isn't
				used either.)</P
><P
>Once you've found an IO range and IRQ that isn't used, you'll
				have to change the jumpers on the BB2016 and edit
				<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/serial.c</TT
> to reflect the new
				settings. Then, compile the kernel and install as per normal.</P

> If you want to use your new Boca card with any standard DB-25
				RS232 connector, you will have to get a special breakout box, which costs about
				$80. The card itself comes with a breakout box that plugs into the card through
				a truly formidable cable. It then supplies phone-like cables for the ports. The
				special $80 box has phone-like cables that plug into the breakout box included
				with the Boca card; you can then plug your modems or terminals into standard
				RS-232 connectors on the box. Unless you actually have a system that accepts
				the phone-like connectors, you should add the price of the box to the cost of
				the card when comparing it to other alternatives.</P
><P
>I got my Boca 2016 card through a special wholesale deal that I
				don't think many people will be able to reproduce. It was available quickly.
				However, the breakout box for RS-232 took about two weeks to ship. You should
				be aware of your need for this box before you acquire the card. The 2016 board
				was $235 and the additional box was $79.95.</P
><P
>I've heard that this breakout box is no longer available, and
				that now people just have special cables made. I'm not sure how you would go
				about doing this, though.</P
><P
>Only one port of my first Boca 2016 worked. I called Boca,
				expecting to hear a long string of questions and advice. When they said,
				"Linux? What's that?" I feared the worst. However, upon hearing my actual
				problem, they cheerfully told me that the card was defective and I should send
				it back; full 5-year factory warranty, 30-days exchange. I was struck by how
				cheery the lady was. It was as though they were expecting the worst, and very
				kindly making the most of it!</P
><P
>I had my hardware guy exchange the card. Unfortunately, the
				cards were back-ordered and they took about two more weeks to give me my new
				card. I have to say that I was quite annoyed at this, since I was anxiously
				chomping at the bit to get this thing up and running. </P
><P
>Some people have problems with ports past the first eight. I
				have tested my card up to port 11 and all the ports appear to be working. Boca
				Research quality control may be lacking; I would recommend that people with
				troubles with the card call Boca and deal with them directly. I suspect that if
				I'd exchanged the card directly through the factory I would have had better
				service than through my dealer. The factory people were all quite nice and
				eager to please.</P
><P
>Right now, I have only four phone lines. I bought the 16-port
				card for two reasons: because it has modem control (unlike the smaller ones),
				and in anticipation of future expansion. </P

>BTW, I've used the BB2016 several times and found them to work
					really well under Linux. I'm extremely happy with them. They perform very well,
					are very inexpensive, and are reliable. They claim 115200 bps per port. I've
					got a unique situation whereby I've got two systems with a PPP serial link
					between them. I'm running this link at 115200 and I experience almost 0% error
					rate (with hundreds of thousands of packets transmitted). My next step is to
					implement EQL and additional PPP links between the boxes to increase the
					bandwidth. We'll see how it goes.</P
><P
>One final note. Contrary to the suggestion in the HOWTO, I
					build my own cables for the BB2016 (they've got RJ ports on them). At first, I
					"dabbled" with RJ45-8 conductor plugs, but the BB2016 has RJ48-10 conductor
					jacks, so to get full modem support, I ended up going that route.</P
><P
>I now run all 10 wires between the BB2016 and my modems. It
					works great! No problems, no regrets! The only initial problem I had was
					finding a source for RJ48 plugs, 10 conductor wire, and RJ48 to DB25
					adapters. None of these are very cheap due to the low demand. Oh, yeah, and
					you need an RJ48 crimper as well.</P
><P
>If you want, I can build these cables for you and send them
					to you. If you're interested, e-mail me and I'll let you know pricing, etc. I
					found building my own was cheaper than the adapter that is mentioned in the
					HOWTO - which I couldn't find a source for anyway.</P

>I believe the adapter mentioned in this document is no longer
				being manufacturered, leaving cables such as your own the only remaining way of
				connecting the device.</P
