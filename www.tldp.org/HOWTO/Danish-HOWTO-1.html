<P>All European users of almost any operating system have two problems:
The first is to tell the computer that you have a non-American keyboard,
and the second is to get the computer to display the special
characters. To make matters worse some applications will also consider you
an exception if you are not an American and require special options or the
setting of environment variables.
<P>Under Linux you change the way your computer interprets the
keyboard with the commands <CODE>loadkeys</CODE> and <CODE>xmodmap</CODE>. <CODE>loadkeys</CODE>
will modify the keyboard for plain Linux while <CODE>xmodmap</CODE> makes the
modifications necessary when the handshaking between X11 and Linux is
imperfect.
<P>To display the characters you need to tell your applications that you
use the ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. Latin-1) international set of glyphs. This is
not always necessary, but a number of key applications need special
attention.
<P>This HOWTO is intended to tell Danish users how to do this. If
you continue to have problems after reading this you can try the
German HOWTO, the Linux Keyboard and Console HOWTO or the ISO 8859-1 National
Character Set FAQ. Many of the hints contained herein are cribbed from
there. See section 
<A HREF="Danish-HOWTO-8.html#docs">Other documents of relevance</A> for
pointers to these documents. You should also send me a mail describing your
problems.
<P>A final problem is that error-messages, menus and documentation of the
applications are mostly in English. There is a GNU project under way to
address this problem. You can see what it is all about by downloading
the file <CODE>ABOUT-NLS</CODE> or the package <CODE>gettext-0.10.tar.gz</CODE> (or any
later version) from your favourite mirror of the GNU archive. This
project needs volunteers for the translations. Send a mail to
<CODE>da-request@li.org</CODE> with the body ``subscribe'' if you want to contribute
to the Danish part of the project. The documentation in the <CODE>gettext</CODE>
package describes how to use such translations in your own programs.
