<!--

<P>There is nothing "special" about configuring &amp; running UUCP under
Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do *NOT* want
to be posting generic UUCP-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*
newsgroups.
<P>Don't post in comp.os.linux hierarchy unless it's really linux specific, for
example: "What's wrong with Debian 1.2 uucp?" or "RedHat 5.0 uucp crashes
when I run it" ...
<P>Let me repeat that.
<P>There is virtually no reason to post anything uucp-related in the
comp.os.linux hierarchy any more.  There are existing newsgroups in the
comp.mail.* hierarchy to handle *ALL* your questions.
<P><EM>IF YOU POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.* FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, YOU ARE
LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR HELP.  THE UUCP EXPERTS HANG OUT IN THE PLACES
INDICATED ABOVE AND GENERALLY DO NOT RUN LINUX.</EM>
<P><EM>POSTING TO THE LINUX HIERARCHY FOR NON-LINUX-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WASTES YOUR
TIME AND EVERYONE ELSE'S AND IT FREQUENTLY DELAYS YOU FROM GETTING THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION.</EM>
<P>The GOOD PLACE is <CODE>comp.mail.uucp</CODE> since you can get answers for most of
your UUCP questions.

<!--
UUCP!information resources!HOWTOs, related
-->
<P>There is plenty of exceptional material provided in the other Linux HOWTO
documents &amp; from the Linux DOC project.
<P>In particular, you might want to take a look at the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>on your own computer in /usr/doc/uucp &amp; /usr/info/uucp* :-)</LI>
<LI>the Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</LI>
<LI>the Serial Communications HOWTO</LI>
<LI>the Ethernet HOWTO</LI>
<LI>the News HOWTO</LI>
<LI>the Mail HOWTO</LI>

</H2>

<P>
<!--
UUCP!information resources!books
-->
<P>HDB &amp; V2 versions of UUCP are documented in about every vendor's
documentation as well as in almost all *nix communications books.
<P>Taylor config. files are currently only documented in the info files provided
with the sources (&amp; in your distribution hopefully). 
The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>"Managing UUCP &amp; USENET"</CODE> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates is in my
opinion the best book out there for figuring out the programs &amp; protocols
involved in being a USENET site.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"Unix Communications"</CODE> from The Waite Group contains a nice
description of all the pieces (&amp; more) &amp; how they fit together.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"Practical Unix Security"</CODE> from O'Reilly &amp; Associates has a
nice discussion of how to secure UUCP.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"The Internet Complete Reference"</CODE> from Osborne is a fine
reference book that explains the various services available on Internet &amp; is
a great source for information on news, mail &amp; various other Internet
resources.
</LI>
<LI>"<CODE>The Linux Networking Administrators' Guide</CODE>" from Olaf Kirch of
the Linux DOC Project is available on the net &amp; is also published by (at
least) O'Reilly &amp; SSC.  It makes a fine <EM>one-stop shopping</EM> to learn
about everything you ever imagined you'd need to know about Unix networking.</LI>
