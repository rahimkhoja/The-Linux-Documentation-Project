<P>This section covers books, web sites, newsgroups, mailing lists,
and other places you can find more information about Emacs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Books</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a a few really good books available for learning
Emacs. In addition to these, you'll find that many Linux and Unix
books also contain a chapter or two about Emacs (and <CODE>vi</CODE>).

<H3>Learning GNU Emacs</H3>

<P>Authors: Debra Cameron, Bill Rosenblatt, Eric S. Raymond 
<P>
<P>Publisher: O'Reilly &amp; Associates - 
<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">http://www.ora.com/</A><P>
<P><B>Commentary:</B> This is probably the best book to start
with. After you've read the HOWTO and looked through the FAQ this book
serves as a comprehensive and very approachable tutorial.

<H3>Writing GNU Emacs Extensions</H3>

<P><B>Commentary:</B> After you've used Emacs for a while and have
decided that you'd like to try writing your own mode or maybe try out
some advanced customization, this is the book for you. While it
doesn't attempt to teach Lisp, it does contain a brief introduction to
the language.

<H3>Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction</H3>

<P>Author: Robert J. Chassell
<P>
<P>From the README file:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is an elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp for
people who are not programmers, and who are not necessarily interested
in programming, but who do want to customize or extend their computing
environment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>You can retrieve the manual in its entirety via anonymous FTP from
the GNU FTP server: 
<A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/gnu/emacs/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/gnu/emacs/</A>.
<P>
<P><B>Commentary:</B> This a good introductory manual for Emacs
Lisp--even if you're not a heavy-duty programmer.

<H3>EMACSulation</H3>

<P>EMACSulation is a column written by Eric Marsden that appears in
the on-line magazine Linux Gazette located at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.com/">http://www.linuxgazette.com/</A>. The most recent column as of
this writing is located at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue39/marsden.html">http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue39/marsden.html</A>. Scan to the
bottom of the article for links to previous ones.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Newsgroups</A>
</H2>

<P>Search you local news feed for newsgroups which contain the string
``emacs'' and you'll probably find many. Those which my server carries
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>comp.emacs</LI>
<LI>comp.emacs.sources</LI>
<LI>gnu.emacs</LI>
<LI>gnu.emacs.bug</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Mailing Lists</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a mailing list for GNU Emacs which is hosted by the Free
Software Foundation. See the web site 
<A HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs">http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs</A> for more
information.
<P>
<P>The only mailing list devoted to Emacs that I know of right now is
the NT-Emacs list. It is a list for folks who are using the Micro$oft
Windows version of Emacs. See the NT-Emacs FAQ 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html">http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html</A> for
more information.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 The Emacs Lisp Archive</A>
</H2>

<P>From the Emacs Lisp Archive README:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Emacs Lisp archives on ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu contain
various pieces and packages of Emacs Lisp code.  Emacs Lisp is the
language used to extend the GNU Emacs editor published by the Free
Software Foundation.  Although much Emacs Lisp code is included in the
GNU Emacs distribution, many people have written packages to interface
with other systems, to better support editing the programming language
they use, to add new features, or to change Emacs' default behavior.
Most of the contents of this archive have been written by individuals
and distributed publicly over the Internet through the info-emacs or
info-gnu-emacs mailing lists or the comp.emacs, gnu.emacs, or
gnu.emacs.sources newsgroups.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The archives are available via anonymous FTP from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/emacs-lisp/">ftp://ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/emacs-lisp/</A>.
<P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> As far as I can tell, the Emacs Lisp Archive is
slowly becoming out of date. I see very few new (or updated) packages
appearing there, though I know they exist. They <EM>do</EM> get posted
to the <CODE>comp.emacs.sources</CODE> newsgroup. (Feel free to correct me
if this is wrong.)
