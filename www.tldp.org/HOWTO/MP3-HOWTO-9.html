<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Encoding from Audio.</A></H2>

<P>Firstly, make sure you have enough space on your drive.  At CD quality, 44.1
Khz 16 Bit stereo, 1 minute takes nearly 10 Mb (5 MB per channel). 
<P>I normally record at DAT quality, which is 48 Khz 16 Bit stereo.
<P>Using wavrec I use the following syntax:
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ /usr/local/bin/wavrec -t 60 -s 48000 -S /mp3/temp.wav
</PRE>
<HR>

The first part is an explicit path to wavrec.  The '-t 60' specifies the
length of time to record for, in seconds.
<P>The third option, -s 48000 refers to the sample rate in samples/sec. (48000 is the rate for DAT, 44100 is CD)
<P>The last option is the path to the output file.
<P>To see the full set of options, run waverec -help, or see it's man page.
<P>This will produce your WAV file  Next you will need to encode it into MP3
format.
<P>Use bladdenc with the following command line.
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ /usr/local/bin/bladeenc &lt;em/[source file] [destination file]/ -br 256000
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The -br option  sets the bit rate, in this case I've set the rate to the maximum
rate of 256k bits/s.  The path to bladeenc may also be different on your
system to the one I've used in my example.
<P>To see the full set of options, run bladeenc -help, actually this is an
invalid option, but will display the list of options.
<P>The same encoding using Lame (as well as Gogo as it is based on Lame) would need the command line
<HR>
<PRE>
[dj@megajukebox]$ /usr/local/bin/lame &lt;em/[source file] [destination file]/ -b 256
</PRE>
