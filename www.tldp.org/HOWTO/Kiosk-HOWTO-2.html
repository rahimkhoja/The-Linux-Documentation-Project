<P>Setting up Linux for use as a web-based kiosk is similar to setting up
Linux as a graphical workstaion, with a few extra considerations. If
the machine is to be a standalone unit, it must boot straight into
kiosk mode. Furthermore, the browser environment must be modified in
to disable standard dialog screens and to eliminate parts of the
browser that allow inappropriate interaction, such as the Location Bar
in Netscape.
<P>Essentially a kiosk website is self-contained. Users navigate through
the site via clicks with a pointing device. The pointing device can be
a touchscreen, a trackball, or a mouse. Mice are difficult to secure
in a public area.
<P>A Linux kiosk can be connected back to a home site via a direct
network or PPP link, requesting pages from the home site, or it can be
a self-contained website, running Apache and any corresponding CGI
modules.
