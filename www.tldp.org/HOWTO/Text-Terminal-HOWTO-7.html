<H2><A NAME="devices_"></A> <A NAME="s7">7.</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7">Terminal Special Files such as /dev/tty </A></H2>

<P> "tty" is an abbreviation for "Teletype".  The first terminals were
Teletypes (like remotely controlled typewriters).  See subsection 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-24.html#teletype">Teletypes</A>.  A list of Linux devices (the stuff
in the /dev directory) may be found in "Linux Allocated Devices" which
should be included with kernel sources.  It "describes" what each
device used for in only a word or two but doesn't tell you how to use
them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7.1">Serial Port Terminals </A>
</H2>

<P> The computer considers each serial
port to be a "device".  It's sometimes called a terminal device since
at one time terminals were the most common use for a serial port.  For
each such serial port there is a special file in the /dev (device)
directory.  /dev/ttyS0) is the special file for the serial port known
as COM1 in the DOS/Windows world. </P>
<P>To send text to a terminal you may redirect standard output of some
command-line command to the appropriate special file.  For example
typing "echo test > /dev/ttyS1" at the command prompt should send the
word "test" to the terminal on ttyS1 (COM2) provided you have write
permission on /dev/ttyS1.  Similarly, typing "cat my_file >
/dev/ttyS0" will send the contents of the file my_file to COM1
(ttyS0).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7.2">Pseudo Terminals</A>
</H2>

<P> Pseudo terminals are pairs of devices such as  /dev/ptyp3 and
/dev/ttyp3.  There is no physical device directly associated with
either of them, not even a serial port connector.   But if a program
treats ttyp3 like it was a serial port, what is read and written to
that port appears on the other member of the pair ptyp3 which another
program uses to read and write to.  Thus two programs talk to each
other via this method and one program on ttyp3 thinks it's talking to
a serial port.  It's something like a "pipe" between these two tty's.</P>
<P>For talking to ttyp3, any program designed to talk to a serial port
will do.  But for the other program that talks to ptyp3, it must have
been specially written to talk to it.  It's mainly programmers that
must concern themselves with pseudo terminals and most users don't
need to worry about them.</P>
<P>Here's an example:  If someone connects via telnet to your computer
over a network (you are a telnet server), the part of the telnet
program handling this connection on your computer may wind up
connected to the pseudo terminal ptyp2.  A getty program should be
running on the corresponding ttyp2.  Getty thinks it's talking to a
terminal.  When telnet gets a character from the remote client, it
goes thru ptyp2 to ttyp2 to getty which then sends back "login:"
routed via ttyp2, ptyp2, your server telnet program, and then out to
the network back to the client.  Here the login program and the telnet
server program talk to each other via a "pseudo terminal".  Note that
there is no pseudo terminal used on the client computer, just telnet.
Of course the server allocates a pseudo terminal (on the server) for
each client.</P>
<P>In X Window, the terminal emulator programs (such as xterm) use pseudo
terminals.  Ham radio programs under Linux also use them.  By using
certain application software, it is possible to have 2 or more pseudo
terminals attached to the same physical serial port.</P>
<P>For a pseudo terminal pair such as ptyp3 and ttyp3, the pty... is the
master or controlling terminal and the tty...  is the slave.</P>
<P>There are only 16 ttyp's: ttyp0-ttypf (f is a hexadecimal digit).  To
get more pairs, more letters such as q, r, s are used instead of p.
For example the pair ttys8, ptys8 is a pseudo terminal pair.  Later
on, even more letters were added so as to allow even more pseudo
terminals.  And when z was reached, they wrapped around to a.  This is
confusing but old habits are difficult to change.  Today Linux allow
say ttyp189 but it's not used.  The device file system, which was
abandoned in 2004, would have used tty/s189.  Be sure not to type say
ttys2 if you mean ttyS2 (a real serial port).</P>
<P>The master and slave are really the same "port" but the slave is used
by the application program and the master is used by a network program
(or the like) which supplies (and gets) data to/from the slave port.
The program using the slave port can run "as is" since it thinks it is
talking to a serial port.</P>
<P>Unix98 pseudo terminals (available on Linux) is more advanced than the
above but the basic concepts are the same (only the device names and
methods of creating them change).  It creates pseudo terminal devices
on request so there is no need to check if the pseudo terminal you
might want to use in in use.  By opening /dev/ptmx a new pseudo
terminal pair is created.  The master doesn't show up as a device but
is just a file descriptor number passed to the computer program that
opened /dev/ptmx.  But the slave is put into the /dev/pts directory:
for example" /dev/pts/3. </P>
<P>The /dev/pts directory is considered to be a file system of type
devpts and appears in the lists of mounted filesystems.  While the
"file" /dev/pts/3 looks like an entry in the now obsolete device
filesystem, /dev/pts Is really a wholly different kind of filesystem.</P>
<P>See the Linux manual pages "pty" and "pts" (Unix 98 style) for more
details.  For programmers there's the man-page openpty/forkpty (either
name displays the same man-page) which assumes that you already
understand pseudo terminals.  There is a usr/include/pty.h file for
use by programmers.  In earlier versions of Linux there was a pty.o
module, but it now seems that it's been built into the kernel.  Here's
an example of some options available when you are compiling a Linux
2.6 kernel:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7.3">The Controlling Terminal /dev/tty </A>
</H2>

<P> /dev/tty stands for the
controlling terminal (if any) for the current process.  To find out
which tty's are attached to which processes use the "ps -a" command at
the shell prompt (command line).  Look at the "tty" column.  For the
shell process you're in, /dev/tty is the terminal you are now using.
Type "tty" at the shell prompt to see what it is (see manual pg.
tty(1)).  /dev/tty is something like a link to the actually terminal
device name with some additional features for C-programmers: see the
manual page tty(4).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7.4">/dev/ttyIN "Terminals" </A>
</H2>

<P> N stands for an integer.  One use
of these in Linux is with the ISDN driver package: isdn4linux.  The
ttyIN is something like ttySN but it emulates a modem and can be given
modem commands.</P>

<H2><A NAME="console_dev"></A> <A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7.5">The Console: ttyN or vc/N</A>
 </H2>

<P> In Linux the PC monitor is usually called the console and has
several device special files associated with it: vc/0 (tty0), vc/1
(tty1), vc/2 (tty2), etc.  When you log in you are on vc/1.  To go to
vc/2 (on the same screen) press down the 2 keys Alt(left)-F3.  For
vc/3 use Left Alt-F3, etc.  These (vc/1, vc/2, vc/3, etc.) are called
"virtual terminals".  vc/0 (tty0) is just an alias for the current
virtual terminal and it's where messages from the system are sent.
Thus messages from the system will be seen on the console (monitor)
regardless of which virtual terminal it is displaying.</P>
<P>You may log in to different virtual terminals and thus have a few
different sessions with the computer going on at the same time.  Only
the system or the root user may write to /dev/vc/0 to which
/dev/console is sometimes linked.  For more info on the console see
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-10.html#console_">The Linux Console</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc7.6">Creating a Device with "mknod" </A>
</H2>

<P> The /dev directory comes
supplied with many device special files.  If you need something that's
not there you may try to create it with the "mknod" command.  See the
manual page ttys(4) for how to do this for serial ports.  To use
<CODE>mknod</CODE> you must know the major and minor device numbers.  You
might be able to infer the numbers you need by using the "<CODE>ls -l</CODE>"
command in the /dev directory.  It will display the major and minor
numbers of existing special files.</P>
