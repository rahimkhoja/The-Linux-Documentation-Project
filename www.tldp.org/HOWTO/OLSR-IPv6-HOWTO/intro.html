    An Ad-hoc network, or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    especially useful when dealing with wireless devices in which some
    of the devices are part of the network only for the duration of a
    communications session and the need for a dynamic network topology
    is eminent. A <SPAN

    A MANET consists of mobile platforms (e.g., a router with multiple
    hosts and wireless communications devices)--herein simply referred to
    as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>'nodes'</SPAN
>--which are free to move about
    arbitrarily. The nodes may be located in or on airplanes, ships,
    trucks, cars, perhaps even on people or very small devices, and
    there may be multiple hosts per router. A MANET is an autonomous
    system of mobile nodes.  The system may operate in isolation, or
    may have gateways to and interface with a fixed network."</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"OLSR is a proactive routing protocol for mobile ad hoc
    networks. The protocol inherits the stability of a link state
    algorithm and has the advantage of having routes immediately
    available when needed due to its proactive nature.  OLSR is an
    optimization over the classical link state protocol, tailored for
    mobile ad hoc networks."</SPAN

    </P
><P
>&#13;    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"OLSR is designed to work in a completely distributed manner
    and does not depend on any central entity. The protocol does NOT
    REQUIRE reliable transmission of control messages: each node sends
    control messages periodically, and can therefore sustain a
    reasonable loss of some such messages.  Such losses occur
    frequently in radio networks due to collisions or other
    transmission problems."</SPAN

    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is
    developed for mobile ad hoc networks.  It operates as a table
    driven, proactive protocol, i.e., exchanges topology information
    with other nodes of the network regularly.  Each node selects a
    set of its neighbor nodes as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>'multi-point relays'</SPAN
>
    (MPR).  In OLSR, only nodes, selected as such MPRs, are
    responsible for forwarding control traffic, intended for diffusion
    into the entire network.  MPRs provide an efficient mechanism for
    flooding control traffic by reducing the number of transmissions
    required."</SPAN
