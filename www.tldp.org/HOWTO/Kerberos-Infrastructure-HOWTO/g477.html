>&#13;Abstract Syntax Notation One. ASN.1 is a notation used describe messages. It describes them as a sequence of components. The described components may be sequences also. ASN.1 is used to describe the internals of Kerberos datagrams. Unless you are a software developer, you do not need to gain an understanding of ASN.1.

>&#13;An algorithm used for encrypted which was the official algorithm of the United Sates Government.  It was developed by IBM with assistance from the NSA. The algorithm is a sixteen round block cipher which uses a 64bit block and a 56bit key.

cryptographic systems.  Kerberos is one example of such a system.

></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;An authentication protocol in which a trusted third party, an arbitrator, is relied upon to perform the authentication of clients on a TCP/IP network.  The protocol was designed in a way that encrypted tickets are transmitted over the network rather than traditional plaintext passwords providing for secure network authentication.

>&#13;In Kerberos 5, a ticket which allows the principal a maximum renewable lifetime in addition to the standard ticket lifetime.  Renewable tickets may be used to acquire additional tickets from the KDC as long as the ticket is valid.  Renewed tickets can be requested up to the maximum renewable lifetime of the original renewable ticket.

>Transitive Cross-Realm Authentication</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In Kerberos 5, the ability to chain trust together between realms building in effect a trust path so that a principal in realm X that wishes to authenticate a principal in realm Z does not need the KDC for realm X to share a secret with realm Z if both realm X and realm Z share a secret with realm Y. Realm Y can be used as a "hop" in a trust path.
