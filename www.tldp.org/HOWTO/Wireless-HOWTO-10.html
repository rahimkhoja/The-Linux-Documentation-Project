<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Appendix A - Netmask 255.255.255.255, proxy arp and bridging </A></H2>

<P>Here we view some Linux advantages in Wireless Internetworking. 
<P>Linux let you specify a netmask like 255.255.255.255 for an interface which
can help you assign IP addresses in to any interface you want, for example
one in eth0, another in eth1 and so on... 
<P>This has not particularly side-effects. 
<P>In addition you have proxy arp setting under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/ethx/proxy_arp
where ethx if your interface. 
<P>If you &quot;echo 1 &gt; proxy_arp&quot; you enable proxy_arp for that
interface while with &quot;echo 0 &gt; proxy_arp&quot; you disable it. 
<P>What's proxy_arp? Quickly proxy arp help you when you want a router answer
to an ARP request if the destination address is in another interface of the
linux router. 
<P>Example: 
<P>
<PRE>
192.168.1.1 ---- 192.168.1.2 Linux router 192.168.2.2 ----192.168.2.1 
</PRE>
<P>To get this example working you should: 
<P>
<PRE>
Without proxy-arp 
</PRE>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In 192.168.1.1 host to set 192.168.1.2 as gateway </LI>
<LI>In 192.168.2.1 host to set 192.168.2.2 as gateway </LI>
<LI>pinging with success from any edge. </LI>
</OL>
<P>
<PRE>
With proxy-arp 
</PRE>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In 192.168.1.1 host to set 192.168.1.2 as gateway </LI>
<LI>do not set gateway for 192.168.2.1 host but enable proxy_arp for right
interface of the router. </LI>
<LI>pinging with success from any edge </LI>
</OL>
<P>Proxy-arp in 2. case let the linux router answer when you ping from 192.168.2.1
host, saying that it has the 192.168.1.1 host so it can answer for it. After,
when the source start sending ICMP packet, Linux router knows that it have
to redirect it to the real host 192.168.1.1 
<P>In Wireless network proxy arp can help you if you have many Linux boxes
that acts as IP Forwarders and you wouldn't set to all hosts a number of static
route. 
<P>You also can experiment Linux bridging in Wireless network: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>install a recent stable kernel </LI>
<LI>download good bridge utils at 
<A HREF="http://openrock.net/bridge">http link</A> or 
<A HREF="ftp://openrock.net/bridge">ftp link</A> </LI>
</OL>
<P>Bridging should be more simple to manage.
