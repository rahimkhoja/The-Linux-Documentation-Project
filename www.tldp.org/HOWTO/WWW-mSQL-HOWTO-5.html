<P>If you have installed msql-2 on your system then you can have a look
at the sample programs written in Lite, msql-2's own scripting
language.
<P>Either version of msql comes with a basic set of administration
tools which allow the user to create and drop tables
(<CODE>msqladmin</CODE>) and examine database structures (<CODE>relshow</CODE>).
<P>The second generation msql (i.e. msql-2) has a few more genuinely
useful utilities: <CODE>msqlimport</CODE> and <CODE>msqlexport</CODE>. These allow
the dumping of flat line data files into and out of the SQL
database. They can be used for loading quantities of existing data
<EM>d'un coup</EM> into existing tables, or extract flat data from
tables, and the user does not have to deal with writing a
<EM>single</EM> line of perl or SQL or whatever code for this task.
<P>If you want to write your own perl scripts dealing with databases
you'll find sufficient support in the example files and the
extensive on-line documentation that comes with the DBI module.
<P>Anyway, you are now ready to go and present your data to the users
of your own network, or even the WWW.
