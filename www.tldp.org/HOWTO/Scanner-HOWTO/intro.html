>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>This document was written to assist the Linux user in setting up a raster image scanner device, including flatbed, hand-held, video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers and so on. 


It does not address how to use the available software tools to achieve a particular photographic result or to utilize your scanner device's features to the fullest extent. 

For that information please consult the application home pages referenced in the text and the manufacturer's information that accompanied your hardware.</P
><P
>Finally, this document does not answer the question <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"What type of scanner should I buy?"</SPAN
> 

The answer varies depending on what you are looking for in a scanner device. 

I suggest looking at the supported hardware list link in <A
HREF="interfaces.html"
>Section 2</A
> and also <A
HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~ljm/SANE-faq.html#buying"

I would also like to thank the many individuals who have taken the time to email me new information and corrections.</P

As this is the first release I am particularly interested in any errata, so don't hesitate to contact me if you know of something I have wrong or needing updating. 

Also let me know if you know of any shortcuts, tools or bits of information that may help hapless users that you think should be included. 

I apologize in advance, but I cannot answer any technical questions or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"plz help me"</SPAN
> pleas regarding scanners; any sent my way will be forwarded to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/null</TT
>; for sources of assistance including live help see <A
HREF="troubleshooting.html#LISTS"
>Section 7.5</A
> instead, but only after reading the relevant sections of this document in their entirety. 

I am neither an expert on scanners nor do I have every model of scanner ever manufactured available for testing. 

My only contribution to scanner support within Linux is the compiling of my own limited experience with the exhaustive input of others to produce a succinct but (hopefully) straightforward HOWTO. </P

NAME="CONVENTIONS"

>1.6. Conventions Used in this Document</H2
><P
>The following conventions are used in this document and are outlined here for those who may not yet have a complete understanding of how to access and control the underlying operating system in Linux, which is almost always via the Bash shell.</P
><P
>First, filenames are referenced in a paragraph like so: <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/path/file</TT
></P
><P
>Commands in Linux are executed (or 'called') at the command prompt, otherwise known as the 'command line.' 

If you are in the non-graphical (text-based) environment you will usually be presented the Bash shell prompt which is a dollar sign: <TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>...or the hash mark: <TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>#</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>...if you have logged in as root or have acquired root, or 'superuser' privileges. 

You can also access the Bash shell in the X window system, otherwise known as X or  X11, with an <A
HREF="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/"
TARGET="_top"
>xterm</A
> or similar X-terminal-emulator. 

Commands to be performed at the Bash prompt, but referenced in a paragraph of this document, usually look like this: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>do this now</B
></P
><P
>&#13;Commands and/or the resulting output of commands may also be outlined with screen output in their own paragraph or heading:</P
><P

CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ date
Sun Jul 27 22:37:11 CDT 2003</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>When a command is written in front of the Bash prompt (e.g. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>$ date</B
> above), it is assumed the [Return] or [Enter] key has been depressed after the command, possibly followed by the output (e.g., the date).</P
