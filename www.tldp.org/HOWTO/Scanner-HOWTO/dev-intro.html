>Devfs</A
>, or 'device filesystem' has been an option in the Linux kernel since the late 2.2-series. 

Devfsd, the device filesystem daemon, creates and removes devices on your system dynamically without the need to manually create devices. If you are running devfsd/devfs you can probably skip the following sections as the process of creating device nodes will be done for you and it's simply a matter of finding the appropriate device node in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
>.</P
><P
>Devfs does not obviate the need to change permissions of devices for access by users.</P
><P
>Beginning in the 2.6-series kernel devfs has been deprecated in favor of a userspace daemon known as udev, though devfs remains as an option. 

You can find information on udev <A

><P
>If you are running a system with correctly configured devfs, udev or libusb, you can skip this step and go to <A
HREF="sane.html"
>Section 4</A
>.  

There are two ways to accomplish the creation of necessary devices manually. One is to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>MAKEDEV</B
> and the other is to create the device nodes at the command line. </P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>MAKEDEV</B
> script is the easier of the two methods, the executable of which may be located in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> or the usual places for storing binary executables (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin</TT
>,<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/sbin</TT
> and so on). 

I direct you to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>man MAKEDEV</B
>, and would caution you to pay attention to the device-specific command options so that you can be sure the major and minor numbers are correct (see the next paragraph for more on this and why it is important, especially if <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>MAKEDEV</B
> doesn't work or you prefer doing things the hard way).</P
><P
>A device can be created as a block (such as a drive), a fifo (file-in-file-out or pipe, as in xconsole) or a character device, which represents other hardware. 

Each device has a major and a minor number <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

> to tell the kernel what it is and where to access it. 

These numbers are not arbitrary.</P

When the system boots up, generic SCSI device files are mapped on <TT

The major and minor numbers for SCSI devices are 21 and 0,1,2,3... respectively. 

You can find out what devices are loaded already with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls -l /dev/sg*</B

For example, if your scanner is connected to the first scsi-bus (and lun and target) of your SCSI host device, you should link it to the corresponding device:</P

><P
>Again, you can skip this step if using libusb. 

USB scanner devices have the major number 180 and minor 48, 49, etc., up to 63. 

First, check <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> to see what directory your distribution lays out its USB directory devices in, as some distributions might have these devices <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>scanner0, scanner1...</TT
>etc., within <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/usb</TT
> or as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>usbscanner0, usbscanner1...</TT
> and so on, in the base <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/</TT
> directory. 

If you find that in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/</TT
> directory the scanner devices have already been made for you then your work is done. 

If not, you will need to create them yourself. 

As root, make a character device for your scanner like so:</P

>3.3. Groups and Permissions</H2
><P
>It is a good idea to be sure that your user account can access the device once all modules are loaded and device nodes created. 

The most security-conscious way to do that is to add scanner access to a particular group. 

On my system, the members of the group 'scanner' are allowed to use the scanner. 

The way to accomplish this is to first change the ownership of the devices in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> like so (as root):</P

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>...where <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>root.scanner</B
> are the owner and group the device will now belong to. 

Obviously the specific command will vary by your system and the type of device, whether <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sg*</TT
> on SCSI scanners, etc. 

It is important that you change the ownership of the device node itself and not the symlink; symlinks' ownerships are affected only by changing the parent devices or files they point to.</P
><P
>To see if your user account is a member of the group in question, as root issue the following command: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>grep -e scanner /etc/group</B
>. 

You should see something like the following:</P

Since no members follow the last colon in the 'scanner' group we can add them, let's say user 'jhs' with the command</P
