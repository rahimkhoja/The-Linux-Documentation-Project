version should be 3.3.3.1 because this version has extended XInput support, 
the second side switch works now and the blocking mouse effect has been fixed. 
<P>If you must use any prior version, XInput support should be available since
3.1.2.d. 
<P>XInput support in XFree is configured basically in a file called XF86Config.
In most cases the XF86Config file is located in /etc or in /etc/x11. I will
show now two very short configuration sections, the first works with XFree 3, the other is for XFree 4.
I will explain then what can be changed and why  this is needed.

</H2>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765705b"></A> 
Please notice the different syntax between
XFree 3 and XFree 4: <BR>
In XFree 3 configuration is done in the section "XInput" with one subsection for each device. XFree 3 has keywords.<BR>
In XFree 4 configuration is done with one section "InputDevice" for each device. All Settings are "options", with one exception: the identifier statement. The Alwayscore option goes to the Serverlayout section.
<P>Because the usage can be seen from the above examples, this difference will be considered
as clear for the rest of the document. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Section Module</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765706"></A> 
XInput support in XFree is reached due to the use of modules. The wacom device
driver module file for XFree 3 is called 
<A HREF="Wacom-Tablet-HOWTO-3.html#_driverlepied">xf86Wacom.so</A>, for XFree 4 the filename changed to wacom_drv.o.
The files are located usually in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/ or in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input. We have to specify
in the &quot;Module&quot; section that we want to load this driver (look at above snippets):
<P>XFree 3: Load &quot;xf86Wacom.so&quot; <BR>
XFree 4: Load &quot;wacom&quot;
<P>
<P>This has to appear only once per XF86Config file.

</H2>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765707"></A> 
A physical device can be:
<UL>
<LI>The tip of your pen</LI>
<LI>The eraser of your pen</LI>
<LI>A mouse like the Wacom products lens cursor, 4d-mouse, graphire-mouse</LI>
<LI>The airbrush</LI>
</UL>
<P>The  penpartner and graphire products simply recognize the type of a device,
but they can not distinguish them. For example, you can not use two different
pens, say, one configured red  and one configured blue - all what these
products say is: &quot;I found a pen tip on my surface&quot;, or &quot;I found
an Eraser on my surface&quot;, or &quot;I found a mouse on my surface&quot;.
<P>
<P>XInput maps the device types to devices, these device types are later
specified in XF86Config. For XFree 3 this is a subsection in the 
section XInput, for XFree 4 this goes to individuell InputDevice sections.<BR>
The devicetypes are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>WacomStylus</CODE>
Tip of a pen or airbrush</LI>
<LI><CODE>WacomEraser</CODE>
Eraser of a pen or airbrush</LI>
<LI><CODE>WacomCursor</CODE>
Mice, like graphire mouse, lens cursor, 4d-mouse</LI>
</UL>
<P>As you can see from above examples, device types are specified with the keyword
&quot;Devicetype&quot; in XFree 3 and with Option &quot;Type&quot; in XFree 4.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7 DeviceName (XF3) and Identifier (XF4)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="_Toc465765708"></A> <P>You must give every configured device a unique name. This name will be used
later in your program to talk to that device. You can choose this name free.
This statement is mandantory.
In XFree 3 you will use the &quot;Devicename&quot; keyword, in XFree 4 you will use the Identifier &quot;name&quot; keyword. Please notice that Identifier is not an Option !

XInput wants to know at which serial port this device can be found. This
allows me to use two different tablets at the same time, for example a graphire
connected to /dev/ttyS0 and a penpartner connected to /dev/ttyS1.
<P>
<P>
<H3>USB Tablets</H3>

<P>USB is treated as a serial line too,
so this statement is mandantory. If you connect your product to the USB, you have to specify this with

<H3>Switching The Mouse Off</H3>

<P>Most people use both, the mouse and the tablet for core pointer functions. 
However, if you want to switch your mouse off and only will use your tablet, here comes the trick for that:<BR>
First, specify AllowMouseOpenFail in section ServerFlags. 
Then set the device to a file which must 
not exist (fake or dummy). Do not set it to /dev/null as this will eat up
your CPU-time.

<A NAME="_Toc465765711"></A> 
The intuos product is more efficient than penpartner and graphire because it
can distinguish many devices of the same type. This means that it is now
possible to use two pens, one configured red  and one configured blue. As you
see, the use of device types is not enough information to handle different
pens. Therefore, each intuos device, be it a pen, ink pen, mouse, or whatever
has a serial number, which you can specify to aid XInput in resolving the
right device. This would look like:

If you set a device in mode absolute, this means, that the active area of the
tablet will be mapped to the screen. Every time you go down to the tablet at
the same point with an absolute device the pointer will appear at the same
point of the screen.
<P>
<P>If you set a device in mode relative, you will get the well known behavior of a
mouse. This means, that if you take the mouse off from the surface, move it and
go down again, the pointer does (ideally) not move.

<P>The other pointer is used by applications which want more information, like
pressure and tilt. <BR>
This is the extension device.
<P>
<P>Starting with version 3.3.3.1, the Statement AlwaysCore tells the driver that it should send 
both types of events.
<P>
<P>If you do not specify Alwayscore in your XF86Config, then this device is
initially used as extension device, this means it is usable only in applications but you can not
control the menus of your window manager with it.
<P>
<P>If Alwayscore is given, then your device acts as core pointer (in addition to the mouse) as well as it sends tilt and pressure information to applications which opened the device in extension mode. 
<P>You can configure two different logical devices, one in Core-Mode and one in
Extension-Mode, to the same physical device.<BR>
To do so, simply type two identical sections, only the DeviceName statement must differ.  Then specify AlwaysCore
only for the last section.

These four statements allow to reduce the active area of the tablet. My intuos
A4 oversize, for example, is so big that you can not do painting work with it
because the ways of  the pen are too long. I use these four Statements to tell
the driver that it should map only the lower left quarter of the tablet to the
screen.<BR>
It is possible to define more than one active area on the same tablet:
Define as many subsections as you need with the same Port Statement but with
different Top... statements and Devicenames. This results in multiple logical
devices all of them restricted to their individual bounds. You may use
one device in absolute mode and one in relative mode as well.

<H3>Getting the maximal X, Y Values, current configuration, and the resolution</H3>

<P>If you use the above four statements, you sometimes want to make some
calculations on the size and position of the rectangle to be defined. Often
the maximal tablet coordinates and the resolution are needed for this. To get
these values, start your server: <EM>X 2&gt;t</EM>.
Kill the X-Server (usually  Ctrl+Alt+Backspace)
and do a 
<EM>grep &quot;X=&quot; t</EM>
.You should get back the values in question.

This option uses the TopX, TopY statements (or their built in defaults, if

<P>This is available since alpha 16 and is used to control the  minimum pressure that is needed 
to detect that a tool is pressed on the surface. It works with intuos and
graphire. Please note that the integer value has to be coded as String,
unlike all other integer values.

USB tells the driver that the serial line is the usb port. 
This needs a Kernel 2.4 with usb enabled.
Alpha 20 driver only supports absolute devices.
<A HREF="#_Tocdevusb">Here</A> is an example for use with XFree 4.<BR>
