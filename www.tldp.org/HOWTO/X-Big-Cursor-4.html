<LI> X servers may have a limit for the maximum cursor
size, especially if they use a hardware implementation for the mouse
cursor. Others do not have such a limit. E.&nbsp;g. XF86_S3&nbsp;3.3
works even with a 512x512 mouse cursor (rather slowly).</LI>
<LI> The magnified cursor font must have the same name as the original
font (the <EM>font name</EM> must be <CODE>cursor</CODE>, <EM>file name</EM> does not 
matter)&mdash;that is no problem as <CODE>bdfresize</CODE> does not change
the font name. </LI>
<LI> The directory with the new cursor font must be placed before the
directory with the standard cursor font in the the font path&mdash;this
is accomplished with <CODE>xset +fp</CODE> (as opposed to
<CODE>xset fp+</CODE>).</LI>
<LI> Changes in <CODE>$HOME/fonts/</CODE> will be visible only
after the command <CODE>mkfontdir $HOME/fonts; xset fp rehash</CODE> 
and only in newly
started X clients (more exactly: for newly created cursors).</LI>
<LI> <CODE>xset +fp path</CODE> may not work on a X-Terminal. In this case
a font server (see the section 
<A HREF="X-Big-Cursor-7.html#fontserver">How to use a fontserver</A>)
can be used if supported by the X-Terminal or some
other method to install the font on the X-Terminal (this can
generally only be done by your system administrator).</LI>
<LI> The same approach can be used for <CODE>olcursor</CODE> and
<CODE>decw$cursor</CODE> fonts and any other cursor font you may
encounter.</LI>
<LI> Cursor fonts produced by bdfresize don't look smooth,
especially at larger magnification factors. It would be nice if
someone could create better looking handcrafted version at
some common sizes.</LI>
