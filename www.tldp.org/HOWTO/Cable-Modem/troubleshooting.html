> A:
There are a number of reasons this may be happening, and future updates to the CDCEther
driver may solve some of them. At least one user on the Linux-USB-user mailing list
noticed that on at least one occasion data sent to the modem from upstream by the
cable provider has triggered it. Also, the modem itself is very sensitive to power
interruptions and can lose the connection if this occurs. The fix is to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifdown ethX</B
>, where <EM
>ethX</EM
> is the Ethernet interface (eth0,
eth1 etc.) to clear out any remaining settings that are hung, then remove the module with
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
> rmmod CDCEther</B
>, reinsert the CDCEther module and then <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifup
ethX </B
>. A reboot may be necessary if this doesn't fix the problem. If none
of these work you probably have a real service interruption.</P

> A: No. The multicast message is pertaining to Multicast support in the kernel,
which is optional and not necessary for the proper functioning of this modem. The message
about 'Ethernet Information' is a design bug in the modem and can be ignored. As for the
'Imperfect filtering support, to quote Brad Hards: </P

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"This is a bit
difficult to explain - I assume that you know what multicasting is - when you join a
multicast group, this can be handled by the networking device so that other multicast
traffic doesn't cause interrupts. That is called 'perfect filtering.' However sometimes
the number of multicast addresses exceeds the number of filters that you have. This
leads to 'imperfect filtering,' which can cut down the number of interrupts, but you
still need to do some work in the networking stack.  Then you get to the typical cable
modem implementation, and there is not filtering at all. Every multicast packet goes
to the host to be filtered.  This doesn't normally matter though, because the cable
modem is a point to point link."</SPAN
