works to prevent the globalization of the toxic
chemical crisis.  In particular, we seek to ensure that the Basel Convention
and its ban (Decisions II/12 and III/1) on the export of hazardous wastes from
OECD to non-OECD countries will not be weakened, but rather ratified and
implemented at the earliest possible date.  We also seek to ensure that the
Basel Convention and other instruments and efforts, serve to prevent the trade
and growth of the world's most hazardous, and often obsolete industries,
particularly with respect to developing or newly industrializing countries.

   up-to-date applications return an older system to productivity. This article
   provides best practices and step-by-step guidance on how to build a working

"In 2005 the Romanian National Meteorological Administration (NMA) received EU funding for its AirAware project. The project's objective was to improve the air quality monitoring system currently in place and to enhance the system with forecasting capabilities. For the management of all the information and the presentation thereof, the team at the NMA developed a portal that is entirely built on Free/Libre Open Source Software. In the future, the team is hoping to open the project to the public."
