extern attacks. However, the constraint is that software upgrades can no
longer be done when the filesystem is mounted. The whole filesystem contents must
be rebuilt and replaced at once.

On slow storage (like USB flash drives), replacing ext2

It takes approximately 400 KB instead of 1700 (glibc). It used by many embedded Linux projects

>&#13;Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can save some space.
</P

>&#13;However, with old kernels, you will miss cool features (such as real-time preemption,
making your system much more responsive) and support for recent peripherals.
It is true that the Linux kernel accumulated bloat over the years: more features, support for more special cases...
Now that Linux is taking an increasingly dominant place in embedded systems, work is being done to control the kernel size.
The <A
HREF="http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/"
TARGET="_top"
>LinuxTiny</A
> project releases a set of patches to
the Linux kernel sources. In the <B
CLASS="command"
>Configure Standard Kernel Features for Small Systems</B
>
kernel configuration section, you can unselect features you do not need in a simple computer.
The minimum compressed size you can achieve for a Linux 2.6 kernel for a simple PC is approximately 350 KB. 
Note that more and more LinuxTiny changes are now available in the standard Linux kernel (no patching necessary).
</P
><P
>&#13;With the latest kernel releases, you may also try 
the <A
HREF="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;real-time preemption patches</A
> from Ingo Molnar.
When full preemption is enabled, it adds unprecedented
responsiveness to the Linux kernel. The latency is much reduced,
suitable for real real-time systems (less than 100 us!).
It is definitely worth trying on old systems
to give them a new youth and improve the user experience!

unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
connections. It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections,
and forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes).
Preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several hundred hits per
second on a 100 MHz Pentium."

is the alternative most people prefer. These systems act as proxy X11
servers and compress datastreams by well over 50 percent for normal
requests, often reaching a reduction to 25 percent of the original
bandwidth usage. With dxpc, X windows applications are quite usable over a
28.8 modem link or across the Internet."

respects to such popular packages as Window Maker, Enlightenment, and

window managers that are a heavy drain on your system resources, but you
still want an attractive and modern-looking interface."

GUI, GUI world! " - or so the major OS manufacturers would
have you belief. Truth is, that while this is increasingly the
case, there are times when the command line interface (CLI) is
still a very good choice for getting things done. It's fast,
generally efficient, and is a good choice on memory or CPU
constrained machines. And don't forget that there are still a lot
of very nifty things that can be done <B

full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal
between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each
virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal
and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64
(ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and
support for multiple character sets). Real multiuser support,
split screen support, hardstatus emulation support, configurable
window seperator and hardstatus strings, permanent window
seperator, many new escapes, logfile timestamps and flush timeout,
optional builtin telnet, optional Braille support, support for
history compaction."

- "is a lightweight HTTP proxy
designed to do the job with a minimum of system resource use.
It's ideal for small networks where a larger HTTP proxy such
as squid might be overkill or a security risk. This simplicity
also makes tinyproxy an ideal candidate for customization - it
takes very little time to read and understand the tinyproxy
source, and thus you can start adding your own desired
features on short order."
