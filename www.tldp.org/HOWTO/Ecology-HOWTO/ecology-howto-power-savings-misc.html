>&#13;Linux halts the CPU in the idle cycle to further reduce power consumption. Early reports of OS/2, Win3.1/95, NT, and Linux showed Linux to use far less power than DOS-based O/S's that spun in the idle loop and consumed power -- this may have changed hence it would need research to validate.
</P
><P
>&#13;Most Linux-users tend to leave their computer on for years whenever
possible. However, several modern BIOS's support an unattended powerup, and
with <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
> you can even do an unattended
<B
CLASS="command"
>shutdown</B
>. No need to leave the computer on night after
night. Other techniques to powerup your computer at certain times
are: ACPI-Wakeup, NVRAM-wakeup and the <B
CLASS="command"
>settime</B
> command.
Computers can even be power up on request remotely by means of
Wake-on-LAN using a network connection or Wake-on-Ring using an
old fashioned serial interface and a modem.
</P
><P
>&#13;Beware of animated web pages! Web pages containing Flash, Java,
or just animated images can consume a lot of CPU.
When you leave your computer and keep it on,
make sure you close all browser pages with animations.
Otherwise, your PC may be left running at full speed while you are not using it.
</P
><P
>&#13;To disable animated images in Mozilla Firefox
go to <A
HREF="about:config"
TARGET="_top"
>about:config</A
>,
find <B
CLASS="command"
>image.animation_mode</B
> and change its value
to <B
CLASS="command"
>none</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>once</B
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;Do not forget to switch off your DSL modem / wireless router / ISP box / printers
at night or during vacations if you don't use them.
These devices consume quite a lot (typically 15W).
