<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>This document tries to help you install and use the ALSA sound drivers
in your Linux system. The reference system is a Slackware 4.0 distribution
of Linux on an AMD/K6 computer (x86 compatible), but it should work with
any other Linux distribution. I do not know if the ALSA drivers work on
other platforms, according to the documentation, Alpha has been tested and proven to work. 
I have only x86 PC's here, so any additional information you may have would be appreciated.
<P>It might be handy to read the Linux
Sound HOWTO (see section Other HOWTO's), but that HOWTO focuses on the built-in kernel drivers.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 General information about the ALSA drivers</A>
</H2>

<P>The ALSA sound driver was originally written as a replacement for the Linux
kernel sound for Gravis UltraSound (GUS) cards. As this GUS replacement proved to be a success, 
the author started the ALSA project for a generic
driver for several sound chips, with fully modularized design.
<P>It is compatible with the OSS/Free and OSS/Linux sound drivers (the drivers in the kernel),
but has its own interface that is even better than the OSS drivers. A list
of features can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/intro.html">http://www.alsa-project.org/intro.html</A><P>Please note that the ALSA drivers are still under development. Things may change over time, and some programs that
rely on ALSA only work under specific versions of it. Apart from that: I think they're great. I use ALSA for 10 months now and
will never go back to the dark ages of closed source sound drivers - hint ;)
<P>The main page of the ALSA project is 
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">http://www.alsa-project.org/</A><P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Supported hardware</A>
</H2>

<P>The ALSA drivers support only a subset of all sound cards available.
As the
time of writing, the following cards are supported.
<UL>
<LI>Cards with a Trident 4D Wave DX/NX chipset, thanks to Trident Microsystems who 
offered ALSA ``first cut'' GPL'd drivers (MIXER and PCM devices only) and documentation for
their 4D Wave PCI audio chipsets. 
See http://www.tridentmicro.com/HTML/products%20folder/audio.htm for more information.

Cards using this chipset include: Best Union  Miss Melody 4DWave PCI, HIS  4DWave PCI,
Warpspeed  ONSpeed 4DWave PCI, AzTech  PCI 64-Q3D, Addonics  SV 750, CHIC  True Sound 4Dwave,
Shark  Predator4D-PCI and Jaton SonicWave 4D.
</LI>
<LI>Gravis Ultrasound (GUS): ``PnP'',&nbsp; Extreme, Classic/ACE, MAX</LI>
<LI>Cards with a GUS chipset: Dynasonic 3-D, STB Sound Rage 32, UltraSound
32-Pro (STB), ExpertColor MED3201 and others with AMD InterWave&trade; chip, notably some STB cards by Compaq</LI>
<LI>Soundblaster: 1.0, 2.0, Pro, 16, AWE32/64, PCI64</LI>
<LI>ESS AudioDrive ESx688</LI>
<LI>ESS ES968 chip based cards (PnP only).
</LI>
<LI>ESS ES18xx (chipsets). Please note that I personally experienced a lot of 
trouble with the ESS1888. The developer of the driver for this card did his best, but to no avail.</LI>
<LI>ESS Solo-1 ES1938 and ES1946. Only one of the two channels works, which means that recording is not possible. The 
author of the ES1938 code ``is aware of the problem and is currently investigating it''.</LI>
<LI>Yamaha: OPL3-SA2, OPL3-SA3 (chipsets)</LI>
<LI>OAK Mozart</LI>
<LI>Schubert 32 PCI (PINE, S3 SonicVibes PCI chipset)</LI>
<LI>Ensoniq AudioPCI ES1370/1371 PCI soundcards (Soundblaster PCI64)</LI>
<LI>SonicVibes PCI soundcards (PINE Schubert 32 PCI)</LI>
<LI>ForteMedia FM801 based cards (in 0.3.2)</LI>
<LI>OPTi 82C9xx chipset based soundcards</LI>
<LI>AD1847, AD1848 and CS4248 chipset based cards</LI>
<LI>AZT2320 chip based soundcards (PnP only).</LI>
<LI>Advance Logic ALS100/ALS120 based cards</LI>
<LI>C-Media CMI8330 based cards</LI>
</UL>

Then a whole lot of Crystal Semiconductors-based sound boards are supported.
These chips can be found in a lot of hardware, in separate cards (some
Philips PCA series) and on motherboards (e.g. IBM Aptiva, Dell computers). Boards
based on the following chipsets are supported:
<UL>
<LI>4231</LI>
<LI>4232</LI>
<LI>4232A</LI>
<LI>4235</LI>
<LI>4236B</LI>
<LI>4237B</LI>
<LI>4238B</LI>
<LI>4239</LI>
<LI>4280</LI>
<LI>4610</LI>
<LI>4612</LI>
<LI>4614</LI>
<LI>4615</LI>
<LI>4680</LI>
</UL>

The best thing is: ALSA now supports computers without a soundcard to produce video! This is done with a dummy
driver, that tricks programs like Realplayer into thinking that there is a sound card available.
<P>A more recent list may be found inside the driver package itself, that
is in doc/SOUNDCARDS
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Other HOWTO's</A>
</H2>

<P>This ALSA-sound-mini-HOWTO is just mini - although it seems to grow fast. Other HOWTO's may help you out in case
this one is too terse. I will name a few things you may come across while trying to
install the ALSA drivers. HOWTO's can generally, be found at mirrors of Metalab (the former Sunsite). So
take a look at 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/mirrors.html">http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/mirrors.html</A>
and pick out your closest mirror site. You can find HOWTO's in the directory LDP/HOWTO/.
Please note: the links in this document will all be relative to /LDP/HOWTO/mini. If you 
look at this document from a reasonably good mirror site, you will find the HOWTO's.
<P>Then a note for the 2.2.x kernel series. For the 2.2.x kernel series, sound support is like any other support: it works,
but it is different from what you used to do. This HOWTO (like any other HOWTO) will from version 2.0pre1 concentrate
on the 2.2 series kernel, although I'll try to point out the differences.
<H3>Sound cards</H3>

<P>Perhaps you bought a sound card already, or maybe it has been installed in your computer for ages. And
now you are going to use it! Have a look at the 
<A HREF="../Sound-HOWTO.html">Sound-HOWTO</A>
to see if this is all worth the trouble. (You might want to buy this new Mega-Rumble-Blaster first, 
then try the ALSA drivers.)
<H3>Plug and Play cards</H3>

<P>Most modern sound cards for the Intel platform are ISA PnP cards, which is an
abbreviation for ''Plug and Play''. This means, that the card has to be
configured by the operation system. This has to be done through an
initialization routine at boot time. You probably need to configure your
card with the PnP-utils-package. Every recent Linux distribution
includes these tools. For usage have a look at the 
<A HREF="../Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html">Plug-and-Play-HOWTO</A><P>The ALSA-drivers seem to have built in their own ISA-PnP-support for a couple of sound cards. Unfortunately,
as I cannot find documentation about this, I cannot tell you how it works. If anyone out there wants to
try ALSA sound support while deliberately not using the ISA-PnP-tools, please drop me a line.
<H3>Loadable modules</H3>

<P>The ALSA sound drivers are built as modules. You can find more information
about modules in the 
<A HREF="../Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel-HOWTO</A>.
There is also a module-HOWTO, but that is unmaintained at the moment; take a 
look at the umaintained section of the Howto-HOWTO. There is a 
<A HREF="Modules.html">Modules-mini-HOWTO</A> though that may be useful.
<H3>Kerneld</H3>

<P>Another HOWTO that will be useful for some, is the 
<A HREF="Kerneld.html">Kerneld-mini-HOWTO</A>.
Kerneld is a daemon that installs and removes kernel modules as
needed. (I have zero experience with it, so additional information on the
topic is welcome. The ALSA driver documentation contains some information
about configuration of the kerneld, this has been included in this mini-HOWTO.)
<P>As the kernel module loader is included in kernel 2.2.x, things have changed. But as I am one of those guys that
rather modprobes something than have some daemon handle it, I have no info on this.
