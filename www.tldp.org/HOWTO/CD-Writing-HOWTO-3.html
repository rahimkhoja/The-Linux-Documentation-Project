<P>Writing CD-ROMs consists of two steps under Linux:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> packaging the desired data (files, music or both) into files
with special formats</LI>
<LI> writing the data from the files to the CD-R with the utility <CODE>cdrecord</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>This chapter describes the steps for data and audio CDs in greater detail.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Writing CD-ROMs (pure data)</A>
</H2>

<P>Note that collecting the data to put onto a CD usually takes longer than one
expects. Consider that missing files cannot be added once the CD is
written and fixated. This is also true for CD-RW, which can currently
only be rewritten as a whole. Using the multi-session feature is no 
option for single files, as it consumes much space for a new complete
table of contents (TOC). UDF is not ready yet for Linux.
<P>Also keep in mind that a certain amount of the free space of a CD is used
for storing the information of the ISO-9660-filesystem (usually a few MB).
620 MB data will always fit on a 650 MB CD-R.
<P>
<H3>Creating an image of the later CD-ROM</H3>

<P>Before any storage medium (e.g. floppy disk, hard disk or CD) can be used,
it must get a filesystem (DOS speak: get formatted).  The filesystem is
responsible for organizing and incorporating the files that should be
stored on the medium.
<P>The usual utilities for creating filesystems on hard disk partitions write an
empty filesystem onto them, which is then mounted and filled with files by
the users as they need it. A writable CD is only writable once so if we
wrote an empty filesystem to it, it would get formatted and remain
completely empty forever. This is also true for rewritable media as you
cannot change arbitrary sectors yet; you must erase their whole content.
<P>So what we need is a tool that creates the filesystem while copying the
files to the CD. This tool is called <CODE>mkisofs</CODE>.  A sample usage
looks as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mkisofs  -r   -o cd_image   private_collection/
              `---------'   `-----------------'
                   |               |
          write output to   take directory as input
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The option '-r' sets the permissions of all files to be public readable on
the CD and enables RockRidge-extensions. You probably want to use this option
unless you really know what you're doing
(hint: without '-r' the mount point gets the permissions of
<CODE>private_collection</CODE>!).
<P><CODE>mkisofs</CODE> will try to map all filenames to the 8.3 format used by
DOS to ensure the highest possible compatibility. In case of naming conflicts
(different files have the same 8.3 name), numbers are used in the filenames
and information about the chosen filename is printed via STDERR (usually
the screen). Don't panic: Under Linux you will never see these odd 8.3
filenames because Linux makes use of the Rock Ridge extensions which
contain the original file information (permissions, filename, etc.).
<P>Remeber do use the Option -J (MS Joliet extensions) or use mkhybrid if you
want to generate a more Windows-friendly CD-ROM. For HFS CD-ROMS used on
the Macintosh, you better read the man-page of mkisofs' bigger sister
mkhybrid for details on various options.
<P>Now you may wonder why the output of <CODE>mkisofs</CODE> is not directly sent
to the writer device. There are three reasons:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>mkisofs</CODE> knows nothing about driving CD-writers.</LI>
<LI>You may want to test the image before burning it.</LI>
<LI>On slow machines it would not be reliable (see section 4.).</LI>
</UL>
<P>There is a method to write a CD-R in one go, which will be described below.
<P>One also could think of creating an extra partition and writing the image
to that partition instead to a file. I vote against such a strategy because
if you write to the wrong partition due to a typo, you can lose your
complete Linux system. Read: that happened to me... Furthermore, it is a
waste of disk space because the CD-image is temporary data that can be
deleted after writing the CD. However, using raw partitions saves you the
time for deleting files of 650 MB size.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Test the CD-image</H3>

<P>Linux has the ability to mount files as if they were disk partitions. This
feature is useful to check that the directory layout and file access
permissions of the CD image matches your wishes. Although media is very
cheap today, the writing process is still time consuming, and you may at
least want to save your time by doing a quick test.
<P>To mount the file <CODE>cd_image</CODE> created above on the directory
<CODE>/cdrom</CODE>, give the command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 cd_image /cdrom
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now you can inspect the files under <CODE>/cdrom</CODE> -- they appear exactly
as they were on a real CD. To umount the CD-image, just say <CODE>umount
/cdrom</CODE>. (Warning: On Linux kernels prior to 2.0.31 the last file on
<CODE>/cdrom</CODE> may not be fully readable. Please use a more recent kernel
like 2.0.36. The option -pad for cdrecord applies to audio CDs only and the
option -pad for mkisofs requires a patch, which is as much work
to apply than to upgrade to a bug-free Linux kernel.)
<P>Note:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some ancient versions of <CODE>mount</CODE> are not able to deal with
loopback devices. If you have such an old version of <CODE>mount</CODE>, then upgrade your Linux-system.
Several people have already suggested putting information about how to get the
newest mount utilities into this HOWTO. I always refuse this.  If your
Linux distribution ships with an ancient <CODE>mount</CODE>, report it as a
bug.  If your Linux distribution is not easily upgradable, report it as a
bug.<P>If I include all the information that is necessary to work around bugs
in badly designed Linux distributions, this HOWTO would be a lot bigger and
harder to read.

<P>
<H3>Write the CD-image to a CD</H3>

<P>This section only covers writing data CDs in TAO mode, because it is the
most frequently used mode for data. For more information about the
differences of TAO and DAO, please see the chapter about audio CD-Rs. If
you use DAO mode with the tool cdrdao, then remember to add a dummy audio
track at the end of the TOC file (see the README).
<P>Not much more left to do. If you haven't already tried, it's a good time for
the command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cdrecord -scanbus
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will tell you to which SCSI device your CD-writer is attached to. All
other methods of guessing the information printed so nicely by cdrecord
have been removed from the HOWTO.
<P>Before showing you the last command, let me warn you that CD-writers want
to be fed with a constant stream of data. So the process of writing the CD image to the CD must not be
interrupted or a corrupt CD will result. It's easy to interrupt the
data stream by deleting a very large file. Example: if you delete an old
CD-image of 650 Mbytes size, the kernel must update information about
650,000 blocks on the hard disk (assuming you have a block size of 1 Kbyte for
your filesystem). That takes some time and is very likely to slow down
disk activity long enough for the data stream to pause for a few seconds.
However, reading mail, browsing the web, or even compiling a kernel
generally will not affect the writing process on modern machines.
<P>Please note that no writer can re-position its laser and continue at
the original spot on the CD when it gets disturbed.  Therefore any strong
vibrations or other mechanical shocks will probably destroy the CD you are
writing.
<P>When you are mentally prepared, dress up in a black robe, multiply the
SCSI-id of the CD-writer with its SCSI-revision and light as many candles,
speak two verses of the ASR-FAQ (newsgroup alt.sysadmin.recovery) and
finally type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
shell&gt; SCSI_BUS=0   # taken from listing 1 "scsibus0:"
shell&gt; SCSI_ID=6    # taken from listing 1 "TOSHIBA XM-3401"
shell&gt; SCSI_LUN=0
shell&gt; cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=$SCSI_BUS,$SCSI_ID,$SCSI_LUN \
                   -data  cd_image

# same as above, but shorter:
shell&gt; cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,6,0  -data  cd_image
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For better readability, the coordinates of the writer are stored in three
environment variables with natural names: SCSI_BUS, SCSI_ID, SCSI_LUN.
<P>If you use cdrecord to overwrite a CD-RW, you must add the option
"blank=..." to erase the old content.  Please read the man page to learn
more about the various methods to blank the CD-RW.
<P>In times where everybody except me owns a 400 Mhz machine, people feed the
output of mkisofs directly into cdrecord:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
shell&gt; IMG_SIZE=`mkisofs -R -q -print-size private_collection/  2>&amp;1 \
| sed -e "s/.* = //"`
shell&gt; echo $IMG_SIZE
shell&gt; [ "0$IMG_SIZE" -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; mkisofs -r  private_collection/  \
|cdrecord  speed=2  dev=0,6,0
            tsize=${IMG_SIZE}s  -data  -
#       don't forget the s --^         ^-- read data from STDIN
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first command is an empty run to determine the size of the image (you
need the mkisofs from the cdrecord distribution for this to work). You need
to specify all parameters you will use on the final run (e.g. -J or -hfs).
Maybe your writer does not need to know the size of the image to be
written, so you can leave this dry run out. The printed size must be passed
as a tsize-parameter to cdrecord (it is stored in the environment variable
IMG_SIZE). The second command is a sequence of mkisofs and cdrecord,
coupled via a pipe.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Writing audio CDs</A>
</H2>

<P>Writing audio CDs is very similar to the steps described above for data
CDs. You can choose between two techniques: DAO or TAO.  TAO (track at
once) is less suitable for music, because you will hear clicks between the
individual tracks. It is described first anyways, because it is a little bit
easier to deal with and DAO is not available for all drives yet.
<P>The main difference compared to writing data CD-Rs is the format of the
images. ISO-9660 (or whatever filesystem you prefer) would not be suitable,
because no audio CD player is able to deal with filesystems. Instead the
audio data must be writen as "16 bit stereo samples in PCM coding at 44100
samples/second (44.1 kHz)".
<P>One utility to convert your sound files into the required format is sox.
Its usage is straightforward:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
shell&gt; sox  killing-my-software.wav  killing-my-software.cdr
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This command would convert the song killing-my-software from the WAV-format
into the CDR audio-format. See the man page for sox for more details about
formats and filename-extensions sox recognizes. Because the output of the
manual conversion takes up much disk space, it was made a built-in feature
of cdrecord for the sound formats WAV and AU. So as long as your sound
files have the extensions .wav or .au (and the sample rate "stereo, 16 bit,
44.1 kHz"), you can use them as audio tracks without manual conversion into
the CDR format. However, cdrecord requires
the size of the sound data to be a integer multiple of 2352 and to be
greater than 705,600 bytes, which is not fullfilled for some WAV files. For
such files the usage of sox is needed to pad the audio data up to 2352
bytes.
<P>
<H3>Writing audio CDs (TAO)</H3>

<P>
<P>An audio CD consists of audio tracks, which are organized as separate
images when using TAO mode. So if you want to have ten tracks on your CD,
you have to make ten images.
<P>Cdrecord writes CD images as audio tracks if the option -audio is
specified. The other options are identical to those used for writing
data-CDs (unless you have very special requirements). These three examples
all do the same thing, but read the tracks from different sound file formats:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
shell&gt; cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,6,0  -audio  track1.cdr track2.cdr...
shell&gt; cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,6,0  -audio  track1.wav track2.wav...
shell&gt; cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,6,0  -audio  track1.au  track2.au...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>By doing this, you will produce an audio CD which has a 2
seconds of pause between audio tracks.
One notable format not directly readable by cdrecord is MPEG Layer 3. To
convert files in this format to the CDR-format, you can use the command
"mpg123 --cdr - track1.mp3 > track1.cdr".  The option --cdr ensures the
track is encoded in the required format (see above). Older versions of
mpg123 require -s instead of the plain - to write to stdout.  The other
direction (converting from WAV to MPEG) can be done with LAME for WAV-files
(extract the track with cdda2wav from the audio CD and encode it into MP3
with the help of LAME).
<P>To create a CD-R from a whole bunch of MP3-files, you can use the following
command sequence:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
for I in *.mp3
do
    mpg123 --cdr - "$I" | cdrecord -audio -pad -nofix -
done
cdrecord -fix
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Depending on the speed of your machine, you may want to slow down writing
to "speed=1" (cdrecord option). If you use "speed=4", your machine must be
able to play the MP3-file at quadruple speed. mpg123 consumes much
CPU-time! If you are in doubt, try an empty run with -dummy (keeps the
laser switched off). 
<P>
<H3>DAO</H3>

<P>If you want to get rid of the pauses between the audio tracks, you have to
use disk-at-once (DAO) recording versus the (individual)
track-at-once (TAO) recording described above. Support for DAO is currently
most advanced in cdrdao. Please see its homepage for details.
<P>If you master the CD in DAO mode, then you use a monolithic image (sound
file) and control track information with a configuration file.
