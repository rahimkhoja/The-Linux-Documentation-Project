<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Setting up a serial link.</A></H2>

<P>To set up a serial link between a Mac and a Linux machine, you will
need, on the Linux side, either a DB9 Female-to-DB25 Male serial cable
or a DB25 Female-to-DB25 Male serial cable, depending on your serial
port.  On the Macintosh side, you will need a DIN9-to-DB25 Male
high-speed modem cable.
<P>Make sure that the cable is labeled a "high speed" cable, because some
older Macintosh cables are configured with their handshaking lines
tied high, which makes them useless for high-speed serial connections.
<P>You will also need a null modem adapter, available at Comp USA, Radio
Shack, and similar outlets, and a DB25 Female-to-DB25 Female serial gender
changer to connect the two serial cables.
<P>I have heard that Mac printer cables are really null modem cables in
disguise, but I can't confirm this.  Some of them are DIN9-to-DIN9
anyway, and wiring one into a serial link would be more trouble than
it's worth.
<P>If this sounds like Greek to you, read the Serial-HOWTO for details of
RS-232 cable configurations and data transmission protocols.
<P>Before connecting the Mac and the Linux machines, you should determine
that you have a working serial port on both machines, either by
connecting a modem and dialing out to another computer with <CODE>minicom</CODE>
(Linux), ZTerm (Mac), <CODE>kermit</CODE> (either), or the communications
program of your choice.
<P>The latest version of minicom is available from 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/serialcomm/dialout">sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/serialcomm/dialout</A> and mirror
sites. 
<P>ZTerm is a complete, easy to use comm program.  Unfortunately, it's
shareware.  A current version is available from 
<A HREF="ftp://mac.archive.umich.edu">mac.archive.umich.edu</A> and
outlets like it.
<P>The <CODE>kermit</CODE> program has been ported to every computer and
operating system in existence.  The archives are located at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.columbia.edu/kermit">ftp.columbia.edu/kermit</A>.
<P>You should strongly consider using <CODE>kermit</CODE> on both machines at
this stage at least, because 1) it's free (although it's not covered
by the Free Software Foundation's General Public License); and 2) it's
a lot less confusing to have <CODE>kermit</CODE> on both machines than two
completely different communications programs.
<P>If you have another way to determine that the serial ports of the two
machines are operational, feel free to use that.  The point is to ensure
that both machines have working serial ports.
<P>Making the actual serial connection should be easy, given the
directions above.  In case it isn't, the connection looks like this:
