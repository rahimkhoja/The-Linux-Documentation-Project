>9.1. Minimum Warranty Provisions</H2
><P
>The weakest guarantee you should settle for in the mail-order
market should include:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>72-hour burn-in to avoid that sudden infant death
syndrome.  (Also, try to find out if they do a power-cycling test and
how many repeats they do; this stresses the hardware much more than
steady burn-in.)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>30 day money-back guarantee.  Watch out for fine print
that weakens this with a restocking fee or limits it with
exclusions.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>1 year parts and labor guarantee (some vendors give 2
years).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>1 year of 800 number tech support (many vendors give
lifetime support).</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Additionally, many vendors offer a year of on-site service free.  You
should find out who they contract the service to.  Also be sure the free
service coverage area includes your site; some unscrupulous vendors weasel
their way out with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"some locations pay extra"</SPAN
>, which
translates roughly to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"through the nose if you're further away than
our parking lot"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>If you're buying store-front, find out what they'll guarantee beyond
the above.  If the answer is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"nothing"</SPAN
>, go somewhere
else.</P

>9.2. Documentation</H2
><P
>Ask your potential suppliers what kind and volume of documentation
they supply with your hardware.  You should get, at minimum,
operations manuals for the motherboard and each card or peripheral;
also an IRQ list.  Skimpiness in this area is a valuable clue that
they may be using no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan, which is not
necessarily a red flag in itself but should prompt you to ask more
questions.</P

>9.3. A System Quality Checklist</H2
><P
>There are various cost-cutting tactics a vendor can use which
bring down the system's overall quality.  Here are some good questions
to ask:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>If you're buying a factory-configured system, does it
have FCC certification?  While it's not necessarily the case that a
non-certified system is going to spew a lot of radio-frequency
interference, certification is legally required &#8212; and becoming
more important as clock frequencies climb.  Lack of that sticker may
indicate a fly-by-night vendor, or at least one in danger of being
raided and shut down! (For further discussion, see the section on <A
HREF="basics.html#rfi"
>Radio Frequency Interference</A
>
above.)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Are the internal cable connectors keyed, so they can't
be put in upside down?  This doesn't matter if you'll never, ever
<EM
>ever</EM
> need to upgrade or service your system.
Otherwise, it's pretty important; and, vendors who fluff this detail
may be quietly cutting other corners.</P
