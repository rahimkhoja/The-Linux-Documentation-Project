>8.1. When to Buy</H2
><P
>It used to be that good configurations for Unix were what the market
called &#8216;server&#8217; machines, with beefed-up I/O subsystems and
fast buses.  No longer; today's &#8216;servers&#8217; are monster boxes
with multiple power supplies and processors, gigabytes of memory, and
industrial-grade air cooling &#8212;they're not really suitable as personal
machines. A typical SCSI desktop workstation is as much as you'll
need.</P
><P
>Prices keep dropping, so there's a temptation to wait forever to
buy.  A good way to cope with this is to configure your system on paper, get
a couple of initial estimates, then set a trigger price, below the
lowest one, at what you're willing to pay.  Then watch and wait.  When
the configuration cost hits your trigger price, place your order.</P
><P
>The advantage of this method is that it requires you to settle in your
mind, well in advance, what you're willing to pay for what you're
getting.  That way, you'll buy at the earliest time you should, and
won't stress too much out afterwards as it depreciates.</P
><P
>Before you shop, do your homework.  Publications like "Computer
Shopper" (and their web site at <A
HREF="http://www.computershopper.com"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;http://www.computershopper.com</A
>) are invaluable for helping you
get a feel for prices and what clonemakers are doing.  Another
excellent site is <A

>8.2. Where to Buy</H2
><P
>The most important where-to-buy advice is negative.  Do
<EM
>not</EM
> go to a traditional, business-oriented
storefront dealership.  Their overheads are high.  So are their
prices.</P
><P
>Especially, run &#8212;do not walk &#8212;away from any outfit that
trumpets &#8216;business solutions&#8217;.  This is marketing code for the
kind of place that will justify a heavy price premium by promising
after-sale service and training which, nine times out of ten, will turn out
to be nonexistent or incompetent.  Sure, they'll give you plush carpeting
and a firm handshake from a guy with too many teeth and an expensive watch
&#8212;but did you really want to pay for that?</P
><P
>There are two major alternatives to storefront dealerships and one
minor one.  The major ones are mail order and computer superstores.
The minor one is computer fairs.</P

>8.3. Computer Fairs</H2
><P
>I used to be a big fan of hole-in-the-wall stores run by immigrants
from the other side of the International Date Line, but most of those
places have been driven out of the regular retail game by the superstores
and the Web.  If you still have one in your neighborhood, you're lucky.  I
do, as it happens, but that is now unusual; the only place you normally
find diaspora Chinese and Indians selling cheap PCs over the counter
anymore is at computer fairs.  (Usually they're doing it to publicize an
Internet/mail-order business.)</P
><P
>You can find good loss-leader deals on individual parts at these
fairs (they're especially good places to buy disk drives cheap). But I call
them a minor alternative because it's hard to get a custom configuration
tuned for Unix built for you at a fair.  So you end up, effectively, back
in the mail-order or Web channel.</P

>8.4. Mail Order</H2
><P
>Internet buying makes a lot of sense today for anyone with
more technical savvy than J. Random Luser in a suit.  Even from no-name
vendors, parts and system quality tend to be high and consistent,
so conventional dealerships don't really have much more to offer than a
warm fuzzy feeling.  Furthermore, competition has become so intense that
even Internet/mail-order vendors today have to offer not just lower prices
than ever before but warranty and support policies of a depth that would
have seemed incredible a few years back.  For example, many bundle a year
of on-site hardware support with their medium- and high-end
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"business"</SPAN
> configurations for a very low premium over the bare
hardware.</P
><P
>Note, however, that assembling a system yourself out of parts is
<EM
>not</EM
> likely to save you money over dealing with the
Internet/mail-order systems houses.  You can't buy parts at the volume they
do; the discounts they command are bigger than the premiums reflected in
their prices.  The lack of any system warranty or support can also be a
problem even if you're expert enough to do the integration yourself &#8212;
because you also assume all the risk of defective parts and integration
problems.</P
><P
>Watch out for dealers (Spectrum Trading for one) who charge ridiculous
shipping fees. One of our spies reports he bought a hotswappable hard
disc drive tray that weighed about 3 lbs. and cost $250 and they
charged $25 to ship it UPS groud.</P
><P
>Don't forget that (most places) you can avoid sales tax by buying from an
out-of-state outfit, and save yourself 6-8% depending on where you
live.  If you live near a state line, buying from a local outfit you can often
win, quite legally, by having the stuff shipped to a friend or relative just
over it.  Best of all is a buddy with a state-registered dealer number; these
aren't very hard to get and confer not just exemption from sales tax but
(often) whopping discounts from the vendors.  Hand him a dollar afterwards to
make it legal.</P
><P
>(Note: I have been advised that you shouldn't try the latter tactic in
Florida &#8212;they are notoriously tough on "resale license" holders).</P
><P
>(Note II: The Supreme Court has ruled that states may not tax
out-of-state businesses under existing law, but left the way open for
Congress to pass enabling legislation.  Let's hope the mail-order
industry has good lobbyists.)</P

NAME="superstores"
></A
>8.5. Computer Superstores</H2
><P
>Big chain superstores like CompUSA give you a reasonable alternative
to the Web.  And there are good reasons to explore it &#8212; these stores
buy and sell at volumes that allow them to offer prices not far above the
Web.  (They make back a lot of their margin on computer games and small
accessories like mouse pads, cables, and floppy disks.)</P
><P
>Note, however: <EM
>Avoid Best Buy</EM
>.  Horror stories 
about them are legion &#8212; predatory salescritters, incompetent
service, routine bait-and-switch tactics.</P
><P
>One thing you should not buy remotely if you can avoid it is a
monitor.  Monitors are subject to significant quality variations even
within the same make and model.  Flatscreens haver this [roblem less than
CRTs did, but you don't want a flatscreen with dead pixels.  So buy your
monitor face-to-face, picking the best out of three or four.</P
><P
>Another good argument for buying at a superstore is that you may
have to pay return postage if you ship a system back to the vendor.  On a
big, heavy system, this can eat your initial price savings.</P
><P
>The only major problem with superstores is that the salespeople who
staff them aren't very bright or very clueful (it's a sort of Darwinian
reverse-selection effect; these are the guys who are fascinated by computer
technology but not smart enough to be techies).  Most of them don't know
from Linux and are likely to push things like two-button mice that you
can't use.  Use caution and check your system manifest.</P
><P
>But if you shop carefully and don't fall for one of their name-brand
"prestige" systems, you can get prices comparable to Internet/mail-order
with the comfort of knowing there's a trouble desk you can drive back to in
a pinch.  (Also, you <EM
>can</EM
> see your monitor before you
buy!)</P

>You can often get out of paying tax just by paying cash,
especially at computer shows.  You can always say you're going to ship
the equipment out of the state.</P
><P
>A lot of vendors bundle Windows and variable amounts of apps
with their hardware.  If you tell them to lose all this useless cruft
they may shave $50 or $100 off the system price.</P
