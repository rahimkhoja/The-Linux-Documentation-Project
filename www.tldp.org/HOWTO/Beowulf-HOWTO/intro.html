>1. Introduction</H1
><P
>This document describes step by step instructions on building a
    Beowulf cluster. After seeing all of the documentation that was available,
    I felt there were enough gaps and omissions that my own document, which I
    believe accurately describes how to build a Beowulf cluster, would be
    beneficial.</P
><P
>I first saw Thomas Sterling's article in Scientific American, and
    immediately got the book, because its title was "How to Build a Beowulf".
    No doubt, it was a valuable reference, but it does not walk you through
    instructions on exactly what to do.</P
><P
>What follows is a description of what I got to work. It is only one
    example - my example. You may choose a different message passing
    interface; you may choose a different Linux distribution. You may also
    spend as much time as I did researching and experimenting, and learn on
    your own.</P
