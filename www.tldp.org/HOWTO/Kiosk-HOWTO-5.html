<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Screensavers</A>
</H2>

<P>Depending on where you deploy your kiosk, you may not want all the
default xscreensaver images to appear. For our <I>Hands-On
Biodiversity Gallery</I> we wanted to display only the animated
fractal images that suggested life science themes.
<P>After testing out several screensaver images, we decided that we to
select randomly between two choices: <I>coral</I> and
<I>forest</I>.
<P>To limit xscreensaver to displaying these two, we created the file
.xscreensaver in the filesystem root (/) with the following options:
<P>
<H3>/.xscreensaver</H3>

programs: \
        coral -root \n\

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Sound Files</A>
</H2>

<P>Our kiosk machine contains a Sound Blaster AWE64 card with attached
speakers. We chose this card specifically because it works well with
Linux sound drivers.
<P>The MySQL database that drives our Biodiversity Gallery kiosk points
to a collection of sound files that a visitor may listen to, including
a ``bird song quiz.'' The downside of using Linux Netscape for a kiosk
is that some of the multimedia aspects are primitive, compared to
Windows and Macintosh.
<P>To enable sound, we implemented a Unix Netscape plugin called Xswallow
written by Caolan McNamara (
<A HREF="http://skynet.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/docs/XSwallow.html">http://skynet.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/docs/XSwallow.html</A>). All the
sound plugins we tested create a separate web page as the sound is
being played (unless the sound file is embedded). Of the programs we
tested, Xswallow worked the best and had the cleanest display page.
<P>Although the extra page is inconvenient, we decided that having the
stability of Linux was more important than the extra click required to
return to the previous screen.
<P>An additional problem is that when a sound is selected, the Xswallow
page displays ``Click to Abort Swallow of type audio/basic''. Clicking
merely returns a blank page. I made a slight change to the author's
source code for UnixShell.c, changing
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
char *text2 = "Click to Abort Swallow";
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to read
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
char *text2 = "Click BACK Button to return from playing file";
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The phrase ``of type audio/basic'' appears to come directly from
Netscape rather than Xswallow.
<P>After recompiling, I added the plugin to Netscape.
<P>A last note about sound files: the original set of files we received
were a mix of .au and .wav files. Our experience was that the .au
files worked the most reliably in Linux and we converted all sound
files to .au format.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Trackballs</A>
</H2>

<P>Not having the funding for a touchscreen display, we opted for a
trackball (and no keyboard) for our kiosk navigation. Our colleague,
Andy Rauer at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, tipped us off to
using ``industry-strength'' trackball components from Happ Conrols
Inc., Elk Grove Village, Illinois 
<A HREF="http://www.happcontrols.com/">http://www.happcontrols.com/</A> (check under their Interactives
section).
<P>One of the things we needed to do was disable any right-mouse button
click equivalents from being used in Netscape Navigator because
right-click events invoke user dialogs.
<P>By building our own trackball, we were able to wire it any way we
wanted. We wired in two push-button controls, both with a left-mouse
button equivalent. The buttons are arranged on either side of the
trackball, allowing ease of use from right-handed and left-handed
visitors. Our gallery designers then took the trackball parts and
built them into the gallery's kiosk enclosure.
<P>For our kiosk we purchased the following components for building a
heavy-duty trackball designed to withstand visitor use (and abuse):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A 2 1/4-inch Atari Trackball Assembly (we selected red)</LI>
<LI>Trackball Interface Kit for IBM (Microsoft serial mouse
compatible)</LI>
<LI>Illuminated Push Buttons (red)</LI>
</UL>
<P>From a local electronics vendor, we purchased a Hammond Manufacturing
plastic handy case (Cat no. 1591ABK) for housing the electronics board
for the trackball.
<P>Anticipating additional kiosks, and potential part failure, we ordered
four sets of each of the above for spare parts and testing.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Designing or modifying HTML pages for kiosks</A>
</H2>

<P>In the best of all possible worlds, you will have the opporunity to
design your kiosk pages from scratch. Bearing in mind that using a
kiosk is a different experience from sitting at a desk browsing the
web from a personal workstation, the following guidelines are useful
design principles:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Keep text passages very short and use large fonts.</LI>
<LI>Avoid screens that require scrolling.</LI>
<LI>Use colorful, large, eye-catching images on every page</LI>
<LI>Create embedded navigation if possible, e.g., return to previous
page, go to next page, go to kiosk menu, etc., should all be designed
right into the pages themselves.</LI>
<LI>Avoid anything that requires a keyboard. Design for clicking.</LI>
<LI>If you use sound files, keep the duration short. Embed them into
the page if possible.</LI>
<LI>Make everything punchy and snappy. Design for short attention
spans and pass-through traffic. Save your theses and exegeses for
elsewhere.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Unforunately you will sometimes inherit pages that were designed for
web browsing rather than kiosk browsing. In these cases it may be too
time-consuming or too difficult to redesign them as kiosk pages. When
implementing standard web pages for a kiosk display:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Remove all external A HREF's, including MAILTO's.</LI>
<LI>Remove all unnecessary verbiage, logos, etc. from the pages.</LI>
<LI>Check font sizes and increase if necessary.</LI>
<LI>Remove any animated GIF's that don't pertain directly
to the pages being viewed.</LI>
<LI>Actually, remove any animated GIF's, period.</LI>
<LI>Do anything else you can to simplify the page design.</LI>
<LI>Check into using server-side includes to add some fundamental
navigation or a consistent graphic to tie the pages together.</LI>
</UL>
