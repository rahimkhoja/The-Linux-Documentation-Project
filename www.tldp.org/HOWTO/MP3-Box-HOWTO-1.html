<P>This is a build guide for a custom MP3 box, which has no harddrive, floppy, or video card and boots from the network. It also fetches the songs from the network. It is intended as template, 
quick reference, and a template to building a custom MP3 box. Frequently 
asked questions related to MP3 box building, its usage, problems, and
references are given.

design the box), Ryan Defelic (for his MP3 box being a alpha-prototype),
