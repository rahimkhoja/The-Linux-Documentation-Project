<P>I would like to stress that there are many excellent E-Mail programs available for Linux.  It is always a matter of personal preference when selecting which one you will use.  
That said, I will tell you that I have been using a program called "TkRat" for over 2 years now - and I love it.  It's a graphical program that has all the features you would expect from a quality mail program, it's easy to learn how to use, it's powerful, and it's free.  For these reasons, I'll only be covering TkRat in this HOWTO.
<P>The first thing you need to do is download TkRat.  You can either obtain the sources and compile them, or you can get the binaries.
<P>Here are some URLs for the software:

<P>When you have downloaded the tarfile, you are ready to install it on your system.
<P>To install the tar.gz source, use the commands:
<HR>
<PRE>
tar -zcvpf tkrat-2.0b3.tar.gz
cd tkrat-2.0b3
./configure
make
make install
</PRE>
<HR>

If anything fails, consult the INSTALL and README files located in the tkrat-2.0b3 directory.  Note that you will need a version of tcl that is greater than 8.1 for this to compile.  You can obtain the latest tcl from 
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/">scriptics.com</A>.
<P>
<P>Congratulations - TkRat should now be installed on your system.
