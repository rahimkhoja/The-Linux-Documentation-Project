<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc7.1">Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>This configuring is normally done by your communications program
such as wvdial.  It may do much of it without even letting you know what
it's done.  In olden days it was done with the "stty" utility.  If you
set something manually with stty, the communications program may
change the setting to something else so it's usually best to just let
the communications program handle it.  See 
<A HREF="#stty_">What is stty ?</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc7.2">Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS)</A>
</H2>

<P> See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-4.html#flow_control">Flow Control</A> for an explanation of
it.  You should always use hardware flow control if possible.  Your
communication program or "<CODE>getty</CODE>" should have an option for
setting it (and hopefully it's enabled by default).  It needs to be
set both inside your modem (by an init string or default) and in the
device driver.  Your communication program should set both of these
(if you configure it right).</P>
<P>If none of the above will fully enable hardware flow control.  Then
you must do it yourself.  For the modem, make sure that it's either
done by the init string or is on by default.  If you need to tell the
device driver to do it is best done on startup by putting it in a file
that runs at boot-time.  See the subsection 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-10.html#sets_boot_time">Boot-time Configuration</A> You need to add the following to such
a file for each serial port (example is ttyS2) you want to enable
hardware flow control on:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
stty -F /dev/ttyS2 crtscts
or
stty crtscts &lt; /dev/ttyS2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to see if flow control is enabled do the following:  In
minicom (or the like) type AT&amp;V (or ATI4 on 3Com modems) to see
how the modem is configured and look for &amp;K3 (or &amp;H1 on 3Com
modems) which means hardware flow control.  Then without exiting the
communications program (such as minicom) see if the device driver
knows about it by typing: stty -F /dev/ttyS2 -a.   Look for "crtscts"
(without a disabling minus sign).  Remember that communication
programs change these settings so you may want to check them after you
have started up your communication program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc7.3">Speed Settings </A>
</H2>

<P> Besides flow control there is speed.  See 
<A HREF="Modem-HOWTO-14.html#speed_">What Speed Should I Use with My Modem</A>.  There's also are
parity and bits-per-byte settings.  Normally the port is set by the
communications program at 8N1 (8-bits per byte, No parity, and 1 stop
bit).  If you're running PPP then you must use 8N1.  So if you get a
complaint that it's not 8-bit clean then it's likely not 8N1 like it
should be.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc7.4">Ignore CD Setting: clocal</A>
</H2>

<P>Normally a CD (Carrier Detect) signal (on the CD wire for an
external modem) is required before a serial port can be opened.  But
if stty has negated clocal (-clocal), then the port requires CD
raised for the port to open and remain open.  Actually, a skilled
programmer can write the program in such a way as to force the port to
open even when CD and clocal say not to.  So if stty shows -clocal
then there might be a problem with opening the port.  But for dial-in,
in some cases you may want -clocal so that when the remote modem stops
sending a carrier and CD drops, the port will close and terminate all
processes running on it.</P>
<P>One way to keep CD raised is to send  "AT&amp;C" to the modem so that
CD from the modem will always be on.  CD always-on is fine for
dial-out but for dial-in, the CD signal is sometimes (but rarely) used
to detected an incoming call.</P>
<P>clocal may be asserted by default in recent serial drivers.  Minicom
raises clocal automatically when it starts up so there is no problem
with it opening the port.  But it restores the clocal setting to it's
original when you exit minicom.  But version 6.0.192 of Kermit hung
when I set -clocal and tried to "set line ...".  </P>

<H2><A NAME="stty_"></A> <A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="Modem-HOWTO.html#toc7.5">What is stty ? </A>
</H2>

<P> <CODE>stty</CODE> is something like setserial but it sets the speed (baud
rate), hardware flow control,  and other parameters of a serial port.
Typing "stty -F /dev/ttyS2 -a" should show you how ttyS2 is
configured.  Most of the stty settings are for things that you never
need to use with modems.  Many of the setting are only needed for
Text-Terminals (and some are only needed for antique terminals of the
1970s).  Your communication package should automatically set up the
several settings needed for modems.  For this reason you normally don't
need to use stty so it's not covered much in this Modem-HOWTO.  But
stty is sometimes useful for trouble-shooting.   More is said about
stty in the Serial-HOWTO or Text-Terminal-HOWTO..</P>
