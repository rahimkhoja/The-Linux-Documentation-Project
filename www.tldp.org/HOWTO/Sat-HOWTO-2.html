<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Background Knowledge</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What about satellite</A>
</H2>

<P>In the last few years satellite began to be applied in Internet networking,
mainly by medium-big ISPs and we have seen it diffused between users. Sat connections
are a very different kind of networking than terrestrial ones, with different
timing such as higher RTT (round trip time), but also with different bandwidth
value, up to 2 Mbps or more.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 How does it work?</A>
</H2>

<P>We can imagine a path like this:
<P>
<PRE>
              |||||| S A T E L L I T E  ||||||||
                   /                       /|\                   
Downl             /                         |      Uploading
load             /                          |      from 
to              /(4)                        | (3)  server
client         /                            |     
              /                             |     
SatCard(parabolic antenna)                  |                                      
             |                              |
            \|/                             |        
       USER PC ----make request-----&gt; SAT-SERVER &lt;---retrieving---&gt; INTERNET
                         (1)                               (2)
</PRE>
<P>So first we make the request (1) (using our Internet connection) to the
Sat-Server, after it will retrieve out info from Internet (2) and it will send
it to Satellite (3); in the end we would receive data from the it (4) to our
home using a parabolic antenna and a Sat Card.
<P>Typically exist 2 kinds of request :
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Http</LI>
<LI>Ftp</LI>
</UL>
<P>Both of them have a little request data and a much bigger answer size,
so satellite works very well with it, but with a big time of answer, this is
the biggest problem of satellite connection (consider a typical Sat distance,
like 36.000 km, so you would have a time access of [ 36000 km / 300.000
km/s = 0.120 s = ] 120 ms you have to add (2 times, cause first ISPs server
send it to, then you download it from) to classical Internet time access.
<P>Recently ISP allows their clients to use also other kind of service, like
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Chat </LI>
<LI>Email </LI>
<LI>News </LI>
</UL>
<P>and many others.
<P>There exist also services called "one-way", which consist in mail service
, download on-demand (where you make a file reservation to be scheduled at
some time) and site download: these services are offline, so you can access
to them without modem (or other kind of) connection.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Other technologies</A>
</H2>

<P>We have to report another satellite technology: the 2-way sat connection.
It uses only the parabolic antenna to contact Internet in both 2 directions.
Its cost is much higher that 1-way connection. We expect something from it
for immediate future, for now it allows a bandwidth of 4 Mbit/s in download
and 256Kbit/s in upload.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 What is the max bandwidth?</A>
</H2>

<P>It depends on many factors: ISP purpose, TCP window used, applications
used by the client and the more important of all, "Internet congestion".
<P>You can expect a max bandwidth of 1-4 Mbps and a average of about 10-30
KBytes/s, but I repeat, it depends on many factors.
<P>Anyway some ISPs tell you they give you a "Max" bandwidth, while the average
bandwidth could be very lower, due to intra-ISP congestion.
<P>Some other ISPs guarantees you to have a "Minimal" bandwidth, which is more
meaningful than "MAX", cause it is available all the time.
<P>Please see Appendix A for more about get downloading performance better.
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 How much does it cost?</A>
</H2>

<P>We have to distinguish between hardware costs and account costs, the first
are known, while the second depend on which service you choose ("guaranteed"/"not
guaranteed", what bandwidth).
<H3>Hardware costs</H3>

<P>To install our little satellite system we need:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Sat card</LI>
<LI>Parabolic antenna</LI>
<LI>one or more feed (converter)</LI>
</OL>
<P>Noticed that we need a digital converter to use Internet via satellite.
<P>Sat card costs depends on brand you choose, about 200US$-300US$.
<P>Parabolic antenna is about 50 US$.
<P>Converter is about 50US$.
<P>So we have about 3-400 US$ of hardware cost (maybe you still have
to add installation cost!!).
<P>If you want also receiver Crypt service:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>CI is about 100 US$.</LI>
<LI>CAM is about 100 US$-250 US$.</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Account costs</H3>

<P>Here costs depend on what ISPs give you access, what's peak bandwidth,
if there is a guaranteed bandwidth (which is more important than peak one),
what kind of service they give you and so on.
<P>Also some ISP gives you free access in change of viewing an always foreground
spot banner (you cannot iconize it!!): in this case you will pay when you'll
go to buy something showed in banner!!
<P>Typically account costs are about 100-150 US$ at year for "not guaranteed"
services and 4-600 US$ or more for guaranteed ones (they guarantee you
a minimal bandwidth you can use also under congestion moments, obviously intra
Sat-ISP congestion!! When you go out to Internet nobody can guarantee you anything!!).
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 What are the satellites used?</A>
</H2>

<P>When we speak about satellites we mean: Astra (19.2 degree SE), Hotbird
(13.2 degree SE), new Europestar (45 degree SE), Eutelsat (8 degree SW), Astra
(26E), ArabSat 3A (26E).
<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 What ISPs give Sat Internet Access?</A>
</H2>

<P>In Europe we know about 8 ISPs giving Sat access for Internet:
<P>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.direcpc.com">DirecPC</A> but this use a proprietary sat card (this is a first Sat ISP )</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.xanticbroadband.com/">http://www.xanticbroadband.com/</A></LI>
</OL>
<P>EON gives access for about 150 US$ at year without guaranteed bandwidth.
<P>Netsystem offers its services at "null cost", you just have to see its banner.
<P>
<P>Starspeeder gives access ??? 
<P>Eliosat costs 350 US$ at year with a 128 Kbps guaranteed (minimal
service, see web site for more);in addition it gives 2-way technology access
for either receive and transmit.
<P>SkyDSL gives access full-time and it costs about 15 US$ at month
with 128Kbit/s bandwidth, but it allows a bigger bandwidth where you pay each
Mb downloaded (you can select from 256Kbit/s up to 4Mbit/s), for more you can
visit its web site.
<P>IMPORTANT : before subscribing some satellite account, please verify "foot
of Satellite" and diameter of parabola.
<P>OpenSky started before summer 2001 in its "beta test": it allows you to try
the sat service downloading at maximum 300 MB at month (free). To register
you need to go at 
<A HREF="http://www.opensky.it/cc/index.asp?f=registrazione.htm">OpenSky registration procedure</A> (which is in italian language!).
<H2><A NAME="ss2.8">2.8 What else?</A>
</H2>

<P>With every kind of DVB card you can also receive TV digital channels (free
channels only) and some cards have support for common interface to watch encrypted
channel. 
<P>Follows the schema:
<P>
<PRE>
Smart-Card -&gt; CAM -&gt; Common Interface -&gt; Sat Card (with support C.I.)
</PRE>
<P>CAM Card (there are many standards used for decryption: SECA, IRDETO, VIACCESS
and others) is the hardware allowing decryption (for TV, Radio and Data) while
the Common Interface or C.I. (ETSI EN 50221) allow connection between CAM and
Sat Card.
