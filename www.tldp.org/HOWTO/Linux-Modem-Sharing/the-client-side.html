>At this time, only Windows client setups are described here. On the
client PC, a COM-port redirector for TCP/IP is required. The best
program for this purpose I have found is 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DialOut/IP</SPAN
> from Tactical Software for 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows 3.1</SPAN
> and 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows 95</SPAN
>.  (The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows 
3.1</SPAN
> version can be used under <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows 
NT</SPAN
> for 16-bit applications only.  A 32-bit
version for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows NT</SPAN
> is due late summer 
1997.)</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DialOut/IP</SPAN
> presents the shared modem on 
a new virtual COM port that it adds to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
>.  
This virtual COM port can be used by <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
> 
programs as if the shared modem is directly connected.  Most client 
applications (including <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows 95</SPAN
> dial-up 
networking) accept this and work as if there were a real COM port and 
modem, with the general exception being fax applications or any others 
that need access to UART control lines. <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DialOut/IP</SPAN
> 
can be configured to provide telnet protocol processing, but that 
feature applies to certain modem pool products and not to the 
Linux setup described in this file.  Note 
that, despite its name, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DialOut/IP</SPAN
> 
can be used also by applications that wait for incoming calls.</P
><P
>On <A
HREF="http://www.tactical-sw.com/"

>http://www.tactical-sw.com/</A
> 
there is a page for downloading a fully functional evaluation 
version that times out in 1-2 weeks.  Installation and configuration 
is handled by a setup program, with installation details in the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README.TXT</TT
> file.  When you run 
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DialOut/IP</SPAN
>, you enter the IP address 
and port number of the shared modem.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>DialOut/IP</SPAN
> is a commercial product that 
is licensed on a per-modem basis, that is, the price depends on the number 
of modems that you are sharing. The license states that you can install 
the software on any number of PC's that access the shared modems.</P
