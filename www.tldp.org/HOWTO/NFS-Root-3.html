<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Setup on the server</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Compiling the kernels</A>
</H2>

<P>On the server side, if you don't plan to use the old, user-mode NFS daemon,
you'll need to compile NFS server support into the kernel (``NFS server
support,'' a.k.a. <EM>knfsd</EM> or <CODE>CONFIG_NFSD</CODE>).
If you plan to use the older <EM>RARP</EM> protocol to assign the client an
IP address, <EM>RARP</EM> support in the kernel of the server is probably a good
idea. (You must have it if you will boot via RARP without kernel parameters.)
On the other hand, it doesn't help you if the client isn't on the same
subnet as the server.
<P>
<P>The kernel for the workstation needs the following settings, as a minimum:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>NFS filesystem support</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_NFS_FS</CODE>).  Note that
there is no need for <EM>ext2</EM> support.</LI>
<LI> <EM>Root file system on NFS</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_ROOT_NFS</CODE>).</LI>
<LI> <EM>Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET</CODE>).</LI>
<LI> The ethernet driver for the workstation's network card (or onboard
ethernet chip, if it's built into the motherboard or chipset).</LI>
</UL>

Where there is an option to compile something in as a module, do <EM>not</EM>
do so; modules only work <EM>after</EM> the kernel is booted, and these things
are needed <EM>during</EM> boot.
<P>
<P>For dynamically assigned IP numbers, you'll also need to select one or more
of these kernel options:
<UL>
<LI> <EM>IP: kernel level autoconfiguration</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_IP_PNP</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> <EM>RARP support</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_IP_PNP_RARP</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> <EM>BOOTP support</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_IP_PNP_BOOTP</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> <EM>DHCP support</EM> (<CODE>CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP</CODE>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>If the workstation will be booted without kernel parameters, you need
also to set the root device to 0:255. Do this by creating a dummy
device file with <CODE>mknod /dev/nfsroot b 0 255</CODE>. After having
created such a device file, you can set root device of the kernel
image with <CODE>rdev &lt;<EM>kernel-image</EM>&gt; /dev/nfsroot</CODE>.
[<EM>NOTE:  Modern kernels recognize <CODE>root=/dev/nfs</CODE> as a command-line
argument; for consistency and/or compatibility, it may be better to use
<CODE>/dev/nfs</CODE> as the device name instead of <CODE>/dev/nfsroot</CODE>.</EM>]
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Creation of the root filesystem</A>
</H2>

<H3>Copying the filesystem</H3>

<P><EM> Warning: while these instruction might work for you, they are by
no means sensefull in a production environment. For a better way to
set up a root filesystem for the clients, see the NFS-Root-Client
mini-HOWTO by Ofer Maor <CODE>&lt;ofer@hadar.co.il&gt;</CODE>.</EM>
<P>
<P>After having decided where to place the root tree, create it with
(e.g.) <CODE>mkdir -p &lt;<EM>directory</EM>&gt;</CODE> and 
<CODE>tar cClf / - | tar xpCf &lt;<EM>directory</EM>&gt; -</CODE>.
<P>
<P>If you boot your kernel without LILO, then the rootdir has to be
<CODE>/tftpboot/&lt;<EM>IP-address</EM>&gt;</CODE>. If you don't like it, you
can change it in the top Makefile in the kernel sources, look for a line like:
<CODE>NFS_ROOT = -DNFS_ROOT="\"/tftpboot/%s\""</CODE>
If you change this, you have to recompile the kernel.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Changes to the root filesystem</H3>

<P>Now trim the unneeded files, and check the /etc/rc.d scripts. Some
important points:
<UL>
<LI> One important thing is eth0 setup. The workstation comes up
with eth0 set up, at least partially. Setting the
IP address of the workstation to the the IP address of the server
is not considered a clever thing to do. (As it happened to the original author
on one of his early attempts.)
</LI>
<LI>Another point is the /etc/fstab of the workstation. It should
be set up for NFS filesystems.
&lt;<EM>NOTE:  this is not true in 2.4 kernels; the NFS mount is implicit and
may actually cause mount(1) error messages if it's explicitly listed in
/etc/fstab.  It is not clear when this changed.</EM>&gt;
</LI>
<LI> <B>WARNING</B>: Don't confuse the server root filesystem and the
workstation root filesystem. (I've already patched up a
rc.inet1 on the server, and wondered why the workstation still
didn't work.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Exporting the filesystem</H3>

<P>Export the root dir to the workstation.
The basic idea is to edit <CODE>/etc/exports</CODE> to include
a line similar to one of the following:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>/path/on/server/to/nfs_root
&lt;<EM>client-IP-number</EM>&gt;(rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
&lt;<EM>2nd-client-IP-number</EM>&gt;(rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)</CODE></LI>
<LI> <CODE>/path/on/server/to/nfs_root
&lt;<EM>client-IP-network</EM>&gt;/&lt;<EM>client-IP-netmask</EM>&gt;(rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>For example, a DHCP client receiving an IP address on a class C subnet would 
need an exports entry similar to this:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>/path/on/server/to/nfs_root
192.168.263.0/255.255.255.0(rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The <CODE>no_root_squash</CODE> parameter allows the superuser (root) to be treated
as such by the NFS server; otherwise <EM>root</EM> will be remapped to <EM>nobody</EM>
and will generally be unable to do anything useful with the filesystem.  The
<CODE>no_all_squash</CODE> parameter is similar but applies to non-root users.
See the <CODE>exports(5)</CODE> man page for details.
<P>
<P>You will have to notify the NFS server after making any changes to the
exports file.  Under Red Hat this can easily be done by typing
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs stop; /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start</CODE>.
On other systems, a simple
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs restart</CODE> or even <CODE>exportfs -a</CODE> may
suffice, while on older machines running the user-mode NFS daemon you may
actually need to <CODE>killall -HUP rpc.mountd; killall -HUP rpc.nfsd</CODE>.
(Do <EM>not</EM> <CODE>killall -HUP rpc.portmap</CODE>, however!)
<P>
<P>You may also need to edit <CODE>/etc/hosts.allow</CODE> and/or
<CODE>/etc/hosts.deny</CODE> if tcp_wrappers are installed.  In particular,
if the remote system (client) gets <EM>RPC: connection refused</EM> errors,
<CODE>/etc/hosts.deny</CODE> probably contains <CODE>portmap: ALL</CODE> or <CODE>ALL: ALL</CODE>.
To enable the client to use the server's portmapper, add a corresponding
line to <CODE>/etc/hosts.allow</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
portmap: &lt;client-IP-number&gt;
portmap: &lt;2nd-client-IP-number&gt;
portmap: &lt;client-IP-network&gt;/&lt;client-IP-netmask&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>There is no need to restart anything in this case.  You can check by
running <CODE>rpcinfo -p</CODE> on the NFS server and
<CODE>rpcinfo -p <EM>NFS-server</EM></CODE> on a Linux client within the allowed
range; the RPC services listed by both should match.
<P>
<P>In case of problems, check <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE> and
<CODE>/var/log/syslog</CODE> for errors (for example, run <CODE>tail -f
/var/log/messages /var/log/syslog</CODE> and then try booting the client),
and check your man pages (exports, exportfs, portmap, etc.).  As a last
resort, a reboot of the NFS server may help, but that's a borderline
Microsoftism...
<P>
<P>
<H3>RARP setup</H3>

<P>Set up the <EM>RARP</EM> somewhere on the net. If you boot without a
nfsroot parameter, the <EM>RARP</EM> server has to be the <EM>NFS</EM>
server. Usually this will be the <EM>NFS</EM> server. To do this, you
will need to run a kernel with <EM>RARP</EM> support.
<P>
<P>To do this, execute (and install it somewhere in <CODE>/etc/rc.d</CODE> of
the server!):
<P>
<P><CODE>/sbin/rarp -s &lt;<EM>ip-addr</EM>&gt; &lt;<EM>hardware-addr</EM>&gt;</CODE>
<P>
<P> where
<DL>
<DT><B>ip-addr</B><DD><P>is the IP address of the workstation, and
<DT><B>hardware-addr</B><DD><P>is the ethernet address of the network card of
the workstation.
</DL>
<P>
<P>example: <CODE>/sbin/rarp -s 131.131.90.200 00:00:c0:47:10:12</CODE>
<P>
<P>You can also use a symbolic name instead of the IP address, as
long the server is able to find out the IP address. (/etc/hosts
or <EM>DNS</EM> lookups)
<P>
<H3>BOOTP setup</H3>

<P>For <EM>BOOTP</EM> setup you need to edit <CODE>/etc/bootptab</CODE>. Please
consult the <EM>bootpd(8)</EM> and <EM>bootptab(5)</EM> man pages.
<P>
<H3>DHCP setup</H3>

<P>There is no need for the DHCP server to be the same as the NFS server,
and in most cases, a DHCP server will already be set up.  If one is not,
however, consult the DHCP mini-HOWTO for further help.
<P>
<H3>Finding out hardware addresses</H3>

<P>I don't know the hardware address! How can I find it out?
<UL>
<LI> Boot the kernel disk you made, and watch for the line where
the network card is recognized. It usually contains 6 hex
bytes, that should be the address of the card.</LI>
<LI> Boot the workstation with some OS with TCP/IP networking
enabled. Then ping the workstation from the server. Look in
the ARP-cache by executing:
<CODE>/sbin/arp -a</CODE></LI>
</UL>
