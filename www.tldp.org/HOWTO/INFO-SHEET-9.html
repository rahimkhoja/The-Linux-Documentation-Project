<P> After Linux 1.0 was released, work was done on several
enhancements.  Linux 1.2 included disk access speedups, TTY improvements,
virtual memory enhancements, multiple platform
support, quotas, and more.  Linux 2.0, the current stable version, has
even more enhancements, including many performance
improvements, several new networking protocols, one of the
fastest TCP/IP implementations in the world, and far, far more.
Even higher performance, more networking protocols, and more device
drivers will be available in Linux 2.2.
<P>Even with over 3/4 million lines of code in the kernel,
there is plenty of code left to write, and even more documentation.
Please join the linux-doc@vger.rutgers.edu mailing list if you would
like to contribute to the documentation. Send mail to
majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with a single line containing the word
``help'' in the body (<B>NOT</B> the subject) of the message.
