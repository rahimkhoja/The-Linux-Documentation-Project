>Your kernel must have support for TCP/IP and PPP compiled in.
Almost all distributions ship with PPP support straight
out of the box.  If yours didn't, or if you're using a custom kernel,
I'll include a little more detail about this in
<A
HREF="installation.html#KERNEL"
>Section 3.4</A
>.
    </P

><LI
><P
>You must install the pppd daemon.  This most likely comes with your
distribution. I'm using ppp-2.3.11.  Later versions should work just
fine, and earlier versions should also work as
well as long as they support the "pty" option.  You don't need to install
chat or any of the other tools designed to work with PPP -- you just need
pppd.
    </P

><P
>The client machine needs to have the the ssh client installed.
There are many different versions of ssh floating around,
but they should all work.
I'm using OpenBSD's <A

>OpenSSH</A
> package version 2.2.0p1.

the client.  OpenSSH includes a very good ssh daemon.

>Finally, you want to install the sudo tool on the server.
You can find out more about sudo in the <A

>Server Interface IP Address</DT
><DD
><P
>The PPP-SSH VPN sets up dedicated network interfaces on both the client
and the server.  The interface will be pppN, where N is the number of
the first unused ppp interface (i.e. it will be ppp1 if you're already
using ppp0 to dial out over your modem).
    </P
><P
>You will need to specify the IP address for the interface on the server.
This address is only visible to the client and server (and to any machines
on subnets that the client and server may be forwarding 
unmasqueraded packets for).
    </P
><P
>If you don't know what IP address to pick, read chapter 2.2 in the
<A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/nag2/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Network Administrators Guide</A
>
and especially look at Table 2-1.
For example, 192.168.0.1 is a good choice.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Client Interface IP Address</DT
><DD
><P
>You need to select the IP address for the interface on the
client.  It must, of course, be on the same network as the
server's IP address.
It must not conflict with any other networks on the client, nor can
it be the same as the server's network interface IP address.
If you selected 192.168.0.1 for the previous answer, you
would probably use 192.168.0.2 here.

it should be listed this time.  If so, then your ppp module

This is OK if you're running the kernel daemon as the PPP modules
will be loaded on demand.
If you're not, however, you'll need to manually load the
modules at boot time by putting a single line consisting
entirely of the word "ppp" in your /etc/modules file.</P

 The ssh server (sshd) listens on port 22.
Our client (because we use the -P flag) only uses the unpriveleged ports
from 1024 through 65535.  This description should have given you
enough information to set up your firewall.</P

ssh connections to the server.
We allow incoming SSH connection between port 22 on the local
machine and any port on the remote.
 Replace eth0 with the interface
that will be carrying the ssh traffic and $IPADDR with the IP
address of that interface.</P
