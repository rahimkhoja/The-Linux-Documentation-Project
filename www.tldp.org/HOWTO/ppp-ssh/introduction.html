></H2
><P
>There are a number of benefits to setting up a PPP-SSH VPN.
It's relatively simple, it uses common off-the-shelf tools,
and it probably won't require a reboot before bringing up the link.
Here's a more comprehensive list:</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Easy to install</DT
><DD
><P
>You probably won't need to patch or recompile your kernel, run
LILO, reboot, or perform any other perilous administration activities.
PPP and SSH are included with most distributions, and
most kernels come preconfigured to use them properly.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Easy to set up</DT
><DD
><P
>You should not have to edit any existing configuration files.
You simply customize the script file provided later in this document,
which contains all the VPN configuration info, and then execute it
on the client machine. Any existing PPP or SSH configurations
should continue to work just fine.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>No mucking with firewalling</DT
><DD
><P
>If the SSH protocol currently traverses your firewall,
then PPP over SSH will traverse your firewall as well.
(If you aren't using SSH, then why not?  It is almost
a required tool for system administrators nowadays.)
    </P
></DD
><DT
>No mucking with manual routing</DT
><DD
><P
>pppd automatically sets up routing for you.
And, if you have very complex routing needs, it's very easy
to put the custom routing commands in the script file.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>No need for static IP addresses</DT
><DD
><P
>PPP-SSH VPNs have no trouble whatsoever with dynamic IP addressess.
The client must be able to find the server to connect to, of course,
but dynamic DNS would work fine for that.
Setting up a VPN over a dialup connection is no problem.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Multiple Tunnels are Easy</DT
><DD
><P
>It's easy to set up multiple tunnels to a single computer.
You simply need to make sure that the IP address for 
each tunnel's network interface is distinct.

NAME="DRAWBACKS"

></H2
><P
>This type of VPN is not without a few difficulties.
Basically, it doesn't run unattended very well.  If you're
looking for a production-quality VPN that you can
set up and forget about, you will proabably find
PPP-SSH a little disappointing.  Some alternatives
are described in <A
HREF="introduction.html#ALTERNATIVES"

><DT
>Trying to maintain a TCP connection</DT
><DD
><P
>If the SSH TCP connection is broken for any reason,
your VPN goes down hard and takes all tunnelled TCP connections with it.
If you have a less than reliable link --
say it's difficult to download more than a few tens of megabytes
at one go -- you will be re-starting the VPN a lot.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Running IP packets over a TCP stream</DT
><DD
><P
>The TCP protocol consists of streams layered on top
of IP packets.
When you <EM
>then</EM
> run IP packets
over the TCP stream (as we're attempting to do),
the personality conflict between the two can become very apparent.
Mostly, this manifests itself as weird delays, dropouts, and oscillations.
Sometimes you'll see problems at load, sometimes with next to no traffic.
Short of changing the entire OSI model (ha ha), there's not much that can
be done about this.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Tends to be bursty</DT
><DD
><P
>For some reason, when network load gets
high, one tunneled TCP connection tends to get all the bandwidth
and the others get ignored.
This leads to timeouts and dropped connections.
Theoretically, this is fixable.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Can't reliably tell when link is down</DT
><DD
><P
>Keepalives are small packets sent to tell the machine
on the other end that the connection is still up.
If the network load gets too high, keepalives
will be delayed.  The other machine will mistakenly
assume the connection has
been dropped and take down its end of the link.
    </P
><P
>Without keepalives, however, there's no way for either machine tell if the
link has been dropped.  When one machine tries to bring the link back up,
if the other machine thinks it already has it up, confusion can reign.
Most often this will show up as multiple ppp network devices,
duplicate routes, and tunnels that appear to be up but drop every packet.
A liberal use of "killall -9 pppd" will usually set things back in order.
A more intelligent start script could probably improve this.
    </P
></DD
><DT
>Too many simultaneous connections avalanches fast</DT
><DD
><P
>When I use regular PPP over a 56K modem and Postfix opens 10+
connections to deliver my outgoing mail, everything works well.
However, when I try to run this exact traffic over a VPN tunneled
over a much faster DSL link, it stalls out.
Ping times skyrocket for a spell (2 minutes and beyond), traffic moves
at a trickle for a while, then it stops completely.
The only way to get packets moving again is to restart the tunnel.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or an inherent
limitation.  Reducing the number of connections that Postfix maintains
for outgoing mail fixed this problem for me..
    </P
></DD
><DT
>It's high-overhead, high-latency</DT
><DD
><P
>Ping times over my 57.6 modem connection are normally in the
130-170 ms range.  However, ping times for a PPP-SSH VPN running 
over the same modem connection are in the 300-330 ms range.  Turning
on PPP compression can help a lot if you're transmitting compressible
data.  Email is compressible, Vorbis files are not.
