<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Overview of the system</A></H2>

<P>It is probably easiest to understand how this system works by tracking
a message from the mailing list to the newsgroup and then a message
posted to the local newsgroup (and gated to the mailing list) and see
how they are handled.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Mail from the mailing list</A>
</H2>

<P>When mail from the mailing list arrives at the local machine, procmail
figures out what newsgroup it belongs in, and pipes the incoming
message to mail2news. 
<P>
<P>The mail2news script processes the message, applying news headers
and then uses rnews or inews to post the message to the newsgroup.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Messages posted to the local newsgroup</A>
</H2>

<P>The local newsgroup is set up as a moderated group, as this allows us
to take advantage of the email capabilities of innd. Any messages
posted to a moderated group are not immediately submitted to the
group. Instead, messages are emailed to the moderator of the group.
<P>
<P>By declaring the moderator of the local newsgroup to be mailing list
address, all locally posted messages to the newsgroup are
automatically mailed out to the mailing list by innd and only appear
once they have been received back through mail2news which adds the
necessary 'approved' line to the messages and are thus acceptable to
innd for posting to the newsgroup.
