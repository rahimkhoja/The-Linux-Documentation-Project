NAME="COVERAGE">2.1. What is covered</H2
><P
>    This document describes the basic concepts behind using XDM
    (the X Display Manager) to manage X terminals and X servers,
    in order to provide 'thin-client' computing, using Linux.
    </P
><P
>    X (or the 'X Window System') is the windowing and graphics environment
    of choice for Unix systems.  Its particular strength (and the key bit
    that we are interested in for this document) is that it separates the
    running applications (web browser, word processor, etc) from the actual
    graphics screen and input devices (mouse, keyboard, etc) via a network
    communications mechanism.
    </P
><P
>    Essentially, this means that you can be running
    an application on one machine, but have its input and output redirected
    to another machine via a network.  This is the key feature that makes
    an X terminal possible.
    </P
><P
>    This document should be treated as a 'getting started with XDM' document,
    in that it describes the basic terms and concepts for using XDM and
    X terminals, with simple examples that provide the minimum amount of
    security.
    </P
><P
>    The reader is advised to consult the list of resources provided at
    the end of the document in order to proceed beyond these basic
    facilities - in particular, the configuration of the 'authentication'
    and security settings should be examined, as the examples given in
    this document utilise the least secure modes of operation.
    </P
><P
>    Please note - the majority of the information in this document was obtained from
    systems running Debian 2.1, SuSE 6.4, Mandrake 7.0 and RedHat 6.0.
    </P
><P
>    This document does not discuss the installation or
    configuration of a network or X on Linux.  Please refer to the
    appropriate HOWTO documents from the Linux Documentation Project for
    details (see <A
HREF="resources.html"
>Section 7</A
>).
    </P
><P
>    This document also does not attempt to describe how to install and configure
    Linux for operation as an X terminal.  For this information, please refer
    to the 'thin-client' HOWTO document, provided as part of the Linux Documentation
    Project, or the Linux Terminal Server Project (see <A
HREF="resources.html"
>Section 7</A
>).

NAME="ABOUT">2.2. About this document</H2
><P
>    This document came about because I wanted to experiment with Linux
    on a 486 PC as an X terminal to my main Linux box.
    </P
><P
>    After reading the man pages, specifications and current howto documents
    relating to XDM and X terminals, I ended up getting really confused
    about where XDM was supposed to run and confusing XDM servers with
    X servers and the like, and so after an evening or two of
    experimentation, this document was born.
    </P
><P
>    Once the basic terminology has been sorted out, the documentation
    for XDM and self-documenting sample files make very good reading
    - I just could not find a simple introduction to the basic concepts
    anywhere to get me started.  Hopefully this document could prove
    to be a suitable introduction to someone in a similar position to
    me.
    </P
><P
>    Oh, and in case you are wondering, a 486dx2/66 with 16 Mb RAM
    makes a fine X terminal!
