>If you've lost the manual, or acquired a secondhand unit that doesn't
have one with it, never fear.  Under the Help tab in older versions there
are links to the PDF and to the <A

corporate website</A
>.  Newer versions have reference documentation
built into the firmware, a good thing if your net connection is
down.</P

>Unfortunately, you're in trouble if you have to bring in Linksys tech
support.  On the one occasion that I called them (in 2003), the first tech
I raised couldn't even speak English, and the second was barely competent
at it.  Both were complete and utter idiots whose response to any
nontrivial question was to put me on infinite hold while they went
off to query someone else &#8212; and then garbled the answer.  Judging
by their accents, my guess is that Linksys tech support has been outsourced
to some particularly benighted corner of the Third World.</P

tested it myself.</P
