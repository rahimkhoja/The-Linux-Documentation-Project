</H2>

<P>
<P>The v2.0.x versions of the kernel include version 2.08 of <CODE>ftape</CODE> I
recommend, however, that you grab the latest version of the full source
code package for <CODE>ftape</CODE>. It is a newer version, includes files that
are not included in the kernel v2.0.X distribution, and includes much
better documentation about how to install <CODE>ftape</CODE>.
The v2.1.x and later versions of the kernel include the version 3.04
of <CODE>ftape</CODE>.
<P>
<P>I recommend that you download the latest stable version of <CODE>ftape</CODE>
which is 4.02 at the time of this writing and is available from
<P>
<A HREF="http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/archives.html">http://www-math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/archives.html</A><P>as well as from
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes/</A>.
<P>You probably should also grab the <CODE>ftape-doc</CODE> and the
<CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package that are available from the same locations.
<P>If you still want to use the <CODE>ftape-2.08</CODE> which is shipped with the
v2.0.x kernels, then you get a version of the driver which is really
out of date and doesn't support QIC-3020 tapes at 2Mbps correctly,
neither does it support the Ditto 2GB drives nor the Ditto Max drives
nor any kind of parallel port tape drive. The section
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-6.html#supp_drives">Supported drives</A>
gives detailed information about which version of the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver
supports which hardware.

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Differences between <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE>, <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> versions</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> use the file system interface that
was implemented for a branch release which was called
<CODE>zftape</CODE>. Actually, the module that implements the <B>VFS</B>
(<CODE>Virtual File System</CODE>) interface of <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and
<CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> still is called <CODE>zftape.o</CODE> and its <CODE>C</CODE>-sources
inside the kernel tree reside in
<CODE>[/usr/src/linux/]drivers/char/ftape/zftape/</CODE>.
<P><CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> (i.e. the version still contained in the v2.0.x kernel)
uses another file system interface, that was implemented by
<CODE>ftape's</CODE> original author Bas Larhoven.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>File Marks</B><DD><P>The conceptional difference between <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> and later versions
of <CODE>ftape</CODE> is the way <EM>file marks</EM> are implemented.
<P><EM>Floppy tape devices</EM> don't have real file marks.
<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>File
marks</B> are used to distinguish different backup sets if you write
multiple backup sets to a tape. SCSI and QIC-150 tapes have
<EM>real</EM> file marks, i.e. between two different backup sets there
is a region on the tape that is written special data to so that the
drive logic can detect that marker when the tape is wound with
(possibly) high speed over those file marks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 Because the goal
of <CODE>ftape's</CODE> file system interface was from the beginning on to
provide an interface that could be used with standard Unix-like tape
utilities (i.e. <CODE>mt</CODE>) the developers of <CODE>ftape</CODE> started to
emulate file marks by storing the positions on the tape where a file
mark should be located in certain fields of the header
segments.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>header segments</B> refers to a region at the
beginning of the tape sized two times 29k to hold some important
information about the tape format and size and some status
information.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, the <CODE>QIC</CODE> standards already designate a special region to
store such information in, the so called <B>volume table
segment</B>. Since <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> this <EM>volume table segment</EM> is used
instead of using unused data fields in the header segment. As a result
it is possible to use your tape cartridge with different operating
systems in the sense that your Win or DOS backup program will realize
that certain regions of the tape cartridge are already occupied with
data, and <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and later will detect the regions used by
those DOS and Win programs. However, you can't extract a DOS backup
set under Linux or extract a volume written by <CODE>ftape</CODE> under DOS,
safe you write your own software to do that.
<P>
<DT><B>IOCTL interface</B><DD><P>There are certain differences in the <B>IOCTL</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This <EM>IO
control</EM> interface is used by e.g. <CODE>mt</CODE> to rewind the tape or skip
to the next file mark or do any other tape operation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

interface between <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> and <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and later. A
detailed description can be found in the <CODE>ftape-manual</CODE> contained
in the <CODE>ftape-doc</CODE> package.  See 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting Ftape</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Formatting</B><DD><P>Formatting of cartridges is supported with <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> and later
<B>only</B>. Please get the <CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package that contains the
<CODE>ftformat</CODE> program that interfaces to the driver to format
cartridges.  See 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting Ftape</A>. The
<CODE>ftape-tools</CODE> package comes with (more or less) detailed
documentation, so the case of formatting cartridges is not dealt with
in this document.
<P>
<DT><B>Compression</B><DD><P><CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> supported user transparent on-the-fly compression in
software. This feature (or <EM>bug</EM>) has vanished in <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> as
it made further improvements concerning the realiability of backups
very very hard. This means, <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> comes without compression
support.
<P>However <B>de-compression</B> of compressed archives produced with
<CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> <B>is</B> supported in order not to brake existing backup
programs where a user-level filter would not suffice to preserve
compatibility. Think, e.g., of <CODE>taper</CODE> which calls the <CODE>MTIOC</CODE>
ioctls itself instead of relying on the <CODE>mt</CODE> program to perform
tape operations.
<P>
</DL>
<P>The <CODE>ftape-manual</CODE> contained in the <CODE>ftape-doc</CODE> package contains
much more detailed information about <CODE>ftape`s</CODE> file system
interface as well as implementation notes which by far exceed the
scope of this HOWTO. See 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting Ftape</A> for
informations about where to obtain the manual.

<H2><A NAME="inst20"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Installing the driver with v2.0.x and earlier kernels</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The following section provides some useful information to get you
going with the installation of v4.x which is <B>not</B> shipped with the
kernel source tree yet but has to be downloaded separately, see the
section 
<A HREF="#getting">Getting ftape</A> above.
<P>Once you've downloaded the source code (probably
<CODE>ftape-4.02-tar.gz</CODE>), untar it.  You can do this by determining what
directory you want the source code to be located in.  I recommend
<CODE>/usr/src/</CODE> or <CODE>~/src</CODE>.  When the tar file is extracted,
it will dump everything into a <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> subdirectory, so that
you'll end up, in the example I've given, with something like
<CODE>/usr/src/ftape-4.02</CODE> or <CODE>~/src/ftape-4.02</CODE>.
<P><B>NOTE:</B> you cannot compile <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> into your v2.0.x
kernel. Instead, configure your kernel to <B>not</B> compile the
<CODE>ftape</CODE> driver and follow the installation instructions in the
<CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> distribution and install <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> as a module.
<P>Read the <CODE>README</CODE> file.  The <CODE>README</CODE> is required reading.  It's
the top of the tree, so to speak.  If there are specific files that
the <CODE>README</CODE> tells you to read then read them.  It will make the
process much less complicated.
<P>Do NOT proceed with compiling the package until you have read the
appropriate <CODE>README</CODE> files and the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file.
<P>Afterwards you need to edit the <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> file and configure you
package according to your hardware. The <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> file contains lots
of explanations so it should be fairly easy to go along with it.
<P>However, most of the hardware configuration can be done via setting
parameters during module load time so most parameters specified in the
file <CODE>MCONFIG</CODE> simply give the default configuration, but you don't
need to recompile the driver to change IO addresses or interrupt
settings. The file <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> and the file <CODE>modules/insert</CODE>
contain examples how to specify the proper module parameters when
loading the kernel modules, so I won't go into further detail here.
<P>If you are using a Linux-v1.3.x kernel, you should consider moving to
v2.0.x.  v1.3.x was the development release prior to the production
release v2.0.x.

<H4>Comment</H4>
Maybe <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE> will be included into the v2.2.x kernel, but
this isn't clear at the time of this writing. This HOWTO will be
revised appropriately when this has become clear. So long you have to
refer to the previous section 
<A HREF="#inst20">Installing the driver with v2.0.x and earlier kernels</A> and disregard the contents of
this section.
<P>
<P>The Linux kernel v2.1.x and later already include <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> so you
don't need to download the <CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> kernel driver package.
<P><CODE>ftape-4.x</CODE> as included in the v2.1.x versions of the kernel can be
completely configured using the kernel configuration menus (either with
<CODE>make menuconfig</CODE> or <CODE>make xconfig</CODE>. Also, there is online help
available that documents each parameter setting which I won't repeat
here.
<P>The various boot- and loadtime parameter settings are explained in the
file 
<P><CODE>[/usr/src/linux/]Documentation/ftape.txt</CODE>
<P>of the Linux-v2.1.x and later kernel distributions.

<H2><A NAME="tape-channel"></A> <A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Following the development of the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you want to follow the development of the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver, you
should subscribe to the Linux Tape mailing list
<CODE>linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu</CODE>. To do so you need to send an email
saying `<CODE>subscribe linux-tape</CODE>' (<EM>in the body</EM>) to
<CODE>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</CODE>.  When you subscribe, you will be sent
a greeting mail, which will tell you how to submit real mails and how
to get off the list again. <B>Store this email in a safe
place</B>. Please.
<P>Please note that I do not, repeat <B>DO NOT</B>, have any special
powers with regard to this mailing list.  If you're stuck on the list,
don't bother to tell me that.  I can only shrug and send you my
sympathy (but that won't get you off the list).

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Mixing <CODE>ftape</CODE> and floppies</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If you use your floppy tape drive with the standard FDC then the floppy
drive and the floppy tape drive cannot run concurrently as they share
the same hardware, the FDC, and the <CODE>floppy</CODE> and the <CODE>ftape</CODE>
driver do not talk to each other.  Thus, if you have mounted a floppy
and then try to access the tape drive, <CODE>ftape</CODE> will complain that it
cannot grab IRQ6 and then die.  This is especially a problem when
designing a emergency disk for use with ftape.  This solution is to
either load the boot/root disk into a ramdisk and then unmount the
floppy, or have two floppy drive controllers.
