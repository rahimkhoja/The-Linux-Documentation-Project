<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Parallel ports, serial ports and mice</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Port access worked with older version, but doesn't work now!</A>
</H2>

<P>Read ..<B>/doc/README.txt</B>  and the port-section 
in ..<B>/etc/config.dist</B>  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Port access was faster with older versions!</A>
</H2>

<P>To have a chance to log port access, by default every port access
produces an exception out of vm86-mode. This takes some time. 
If you don't want to log port access, use the keyword <B>"fast"</B> in the
appropriate port statement.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Where are the (microsoft compatible) mouse drivers?</A>
</H2>

<P>Tom Kimball (<B>tk@pssparc2.oc.com</B>) reported (93/11/24) that
<P>Several people said to use a different mouse driver and suggested
some.  I found a couple that seem to work fine.
<PRE>
   oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/mouse/mouse701.zip   (mscmouse)
   oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/mouse/gmous102.zip   (gmouse)
</PRE>

Normally you can use dosemu's internaldriver, so you don't need any
additional mousedriver in dosemu outside winemu(97/2/10).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Why doesn't the mouse driver work?</A>
</H2>

<P>Mark Rejhon (<B>mdrejhon@magi.com</B>) reported (95/4/7) that
<P>If you start the mouse driver and it just hangs (it might actually
take 30-60s), but if you are waiting longer than a minute for the
mouse driver to start, try specifying the COM port that the mouse
is on, at the mouse driver command line.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Why does dosemu clobber COM4?</A>
</H2>

<P>Rob Janssen (<B>rob@pe1chl.ampr.org</B>) reported (94/3/24) that
<P>According to <B>jmorriso@bogomips.ee.ubc.ca</B>, "dosemu still
clobbers COM4 (0x2e8, IRQ 5). 0x2e8 isn't in ports{} in config.  I
have to run setserial /dev/cua3 irq 5 on it after dosemu exits."
<P>This is caused by your VGA BIOS.  I have found that by enabling the IO
port trace and seeing where it was clobbered.
<P>Disable the "<CODE>allowvideoportaccess on</CODE>" line in config and it will
work fine.  When you then have problems with the video, try to enable
more selective ranges of IO addresses (e.g., 40-43).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 How do I use dosemu over the serial ports?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 How can I switch between dosemu and a shell over the serial line?</A>
</H2>

<P>John Taylor (<B>taylor@pollux.cs.uga.edu</B>) reported (94/5/25)
that
<P>I am running Linux 1.1.13 and want to point out a great feature that
should be protected and not taken out (IMHO). With the 52 version, I
can run the program, "screen."  From screen, i can invoke dos -D-a.
What is really great (IMHO) is the screen commands (the CTRL-A cmds)
still work. This means I can do a CTRL-A C and add another unix shell,
and switch between the two (DOS / UNIX).  This allows me to use dosemu
over the serial line really well, because switching is made easy.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 How can I get the parallel ports to work?</A>
</H2>

<P>The dosemu.conf has lines at the end to redirect printers to either
lpr or a file.  If you want direct access to the bare metal, comment
out these emulation lines, and add the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
$_ports { device /dev/lp0 fast range 0x3bc 0x3bf  } # lpt0
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

for the "monitor card" printer port (corresponds to /dev/lp0), or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
$_ports { device /dev/lp1 fast range 0x378 0x37f } # lpt1
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
$_ports { device /dev/lp1 fast range 0x278 0x27f } # lpt2
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

for LPT1 (/dev/lp1) or LPT2 (/dev/lp2) respectively(97/2/9).

<P>But NOTE: these lines should not be _added_ simply, the string should
be concatenated such as:
<P>$_ports = "...."
$_ports = $_ports, " device /dev/lp0 fast range 0x3bc 0x3bf"

This blank is important
