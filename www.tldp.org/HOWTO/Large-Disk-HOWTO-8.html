<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Kernel disk translation for IDE disks</A></H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!translation done by kernel
-->

If the Linux kernel detects the presence of some disk manager
on an IDE disk, it will try to remap the disk in the same way
this disk manager would have done, so that Linux sees the same
disk partitioning as for example DOS with OnTrack or EZ-Drive.
However, NO remapping is done when a geometry was specified
on the command line - so a
`<CODE>hd=</CODE><I>cyls</I><CODE>,</CODE><I>heads</I><CODE>,</CODE><I>secs</I>' command line option
might well kill compatibility with a disk manager.
<P>If you are hit by this, and know someone who can compile a new
kernel for you, find the file <CODE>linux/drivers/block/ide.c</CODE>
and remove in the routine <CODE>ide_xlate_1024()</CODE> the test
<CODE>if (drive->forced_geom) { ...; return 0; }</CODE>.
<P>The remapping is done by trying 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 255 heads
(keeping H<CODE>*</CODE>C constant) until either C &lt;= 1024 or H = 255.
<P>The details are as follows - subsection headers are the strings
appearing in the corresponding boot messages.  Here and everywhere
else in this text partition types are given in hexadecimal.

<!--
disk!EZ-Drive translation
-->

<!--
disk!EZD translation
-->

EZ-Drive is detected by the fact that the first primary partition
has type 55.  The geometry is remapped as described above,
and the partition table from sector 0 is discarded - instead
the partition table is read from sector 1.  Disk block numbers
are not changed, but writes to sector 0 are redirected to sector 1.
This behaviour can be changed by recompiling the kernel with
<CODE> #define FAKE_FDISK_FOR_EZDRIVE  0 </CODE>
in <CODE>ide.c</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 DM6:DDO</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!OnTrack DiskManager translation
-->

<!--
disk!DM6:DD0 translation
-->

OnTrack DiskManager (on the first disk) is detected by the fact
that the first primary partition has type 54.  The geometry is
remapped as described above and the entire disk is shifted by
63 sectors (so that the old sector 63 becomes sector 0).
Afterwards a new MBR (with partition table) is read from
the new sector 0.  Of course this shift is to make room for
the DDO - that is why there is no shift on other disks.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 DM6:AUX</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!OnTrack DiskManager translation
-->

<!--
disk!DM6:AUX
-->

OnTrack DiskManager (on other disks) is detected by the fact
that the first primary partition has type 51 or 53.
The geometry is remapped as described above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 DM6:MBR</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!OnTrack DiskManager translation
-->

<!--
disk!DM6:MBR
-->

An older version of OnTrack DiskManager is detected not by
partition type, but by signature.  (Test whether the offset
found in bytes 2 and 3 of the MBR is not more than 430, and
the short found at this offset equals 0x55AA, and is followed
by an odd byte.) Again the geometry is remapped as above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 PTBL</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!PTBL translation
-->

Finally, there is a test that tries to deduce a translation
from the <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> values of the primary partitions:
If some partition has start and end sector number 1 and 63, respectively,
and end heads 31, 63, 127 or 254, then, since it is customary
to end partitions on a cylinder boundary, and since moreover
the IDE interface uses at most 16 heads, it is conjectured
that a BIOS translation is active, and the geometry is
remapped to use 32, 64, 128 or 255 heads, respectively.
However, no remapping is done when the current idea of the
geometry already has 63 sectors per track and at least as
many heads (since this probably means that a remapping was
done already).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Getting rid of a disk manager</A>
</H2>

<P>When Linux detects OnTrack Disk Manager, it will shift all disk
accesses by 63 sectors. Similarly, when Linux detects EZ-Drive,
it shifts all accesses of sector 0 to sector 1.
This means that it may be difficult to get rid of these disk managers.
Most disk managers have an uninstall option, but if you need to remove
some disk manager an approach that often works is to give an explicit
disk geometry on the command line. Now Linux skips the <CODE>ide_xlate_1024()</CODE>
routine, and one can wipe out the partition table with disk manager
(and probably lose access to all disk data) with the command
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdx bs=512 count=1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The details depend a little on kernel version.
Recent kernels (since 2.3.21) recognize boot parameters like "hda=remap" and
"hdb=noremap", so that it is possible to get or avoid the EZD shift regardless of
the contents of the partition table. The "hdX=noremap" boot parameter also
avoids the OnTrack Disk Manager shift.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 Since 2.5.70: boot parameters</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In 2.5.70 the automatic disk manager support was removed.
Instead, two boot options were added: "hda=remap" to do
the EZ-Drive remapping of sector 0 to sector 1, and
"hda=remap63" to do the OnTrack Disk Manager shift over 63 sectors.
<P>This also means that it no longer is a problem to get rid of
a disk manager.
