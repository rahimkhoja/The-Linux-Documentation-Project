<P>This mini-Howto was originally derived from a posting in the
<CODE>
<A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.misc">comp.os.linux.misc</A></CODE>
newsgroup by Robin Glover
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:swrglovr@met.rdg.ac.uk">swrglovr@met.rdg.ac.uk</A></CODE>.
I would like to thank Robin for graciously allowing me to rework his ideas into
this mini-Howto.
<P>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again all the
people who've written to me about the Howto.  Receiving grateful comments
makes the effort worth while.

of this book is merely the adolescent whinings of people who think that
<EM>their</EM> operating system was so much better than Unix, and much of the
rest simply doesn't apply if you have a well-written user-space such as GNU.
But there is some wheat among the chaff; for example, the discussion of how
easy it is to delete files under Unix is well worth reading.
