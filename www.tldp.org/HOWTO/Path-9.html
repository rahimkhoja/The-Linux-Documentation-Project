<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 XDM</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>XDM is the most common way to log in to a graphical terminal. It a bit
looks like login but it is internally totally different.
<P>In directory /etc/X11/xdm there are configuration files that are
executed on different login phases. Xstartup (and Xstartup_0 specially
for screen 0) contains commands to be run after the user has logged in
(commands are run as user root).
<P>The path that is set for users is in /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config. There
are lines:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DisplayManager*userPath: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games 
DisplayManager*systemPath: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That will be a default path for normal and root users respectively. It
is very important that /usr/bin/X11 is available for X users. If X
user logs in to another machine to start and X client application, he
should get /usr/bin/X11 to his path even he don't seem to come
directly from X terminal.
<P>After running Xstartup the XDM runs /etc/X11/Xsession that is run as
the final user. Local configuration is meant to be done in
/etc/environment that is sourced (included) from Xsession if available
(Xsession is run with /bin/sh and thus /etc/environment must be a sh
file). This clashes with ssh that supposes that /etc/environment is a
file that contains just lines of form VAR=VALUE.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 xterm -ls</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>By default the path for all the commands invoked from X window manager
menus is the path inherited from XDM. To use something different it
must be set explicitly. To start a terminal emulator with a path that
is "normal" some special option must be used. In xterm the option -ls
(login shell) must be used to get a login shell with path specified in
shell login initialization files.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Window manager menus and buttons</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Window manager inherits environment of XDM.  All the programs started
by the window manager inherit the environment of the window manager.
<P>User shell environment does not affect the programs that are started
from window manager buttons and menus.  For example, if program is
started from 'xterm -ls', it has the default environment of login
shell but if it is started from menu, it has just environment of the
window manager.
