>A hard disk can have a maximum of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>4</TT
> primary
      partitions &#8211; don't ask me why, I don't know. Apart from primary
      partitions a hard disk can also have what is known as an extended partition
      which inturn can hold a number of logical partitions &#8211; I believe the
      number is close to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>15</TT
>. The extended partitions are not
      real partitions like primary or logical partitions in that they don't store
      data but are actually containers for logical partitions which is where data
      is actually stored &#8211; as you can see it is uneccessarily complex. Thus
      in Windows <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>C</I
> is a primary partition and if you used
      Windows <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> &#8211; Windows
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Fdisk</SPAN
> will not make more than one primary
      partition to partition your hard disk &#8211; <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>D</I
> is
      usually the first logical partition of the extended
      partition. <I
CLASS="MEDIALABEL"
>E</I
> would be the second logical partition
      and so on. In Linux things are slightly different. The first primary
      partition is called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
>, the
      second primary partition <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
>
      upto the fourth which is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda4</TT
>.
      Linux refers to the an extended partition as in the case of a disk with
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT
> primary and one extended partition as 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda1</TT
> for the primary and 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda2</TT
> for the extended. The
      logical partitions of the extended partitions are referred to as 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda5</TT
>, 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda6</TT
> and so on. The second hard disk
      would be referred to as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb</TT
>,
      the third <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdc</TT
> (usually the
      cdrom drive if set as secondary master) and the fourth and last hard disk as
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdd</TT
> (last because the
      motherboard has place for a maximum of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>4</TT
>
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IDE</SPAN
> devices) <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SCSI</SPAN
> devices are referred
      to as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda</TT
> &#8211; thank god for
      that.</P
