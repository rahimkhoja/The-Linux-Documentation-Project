></H1
><P
>Programmers and Enthusiasts &#8211; For programmers Linux is already a
      near perfect solution. No other system gives so offers you a wider array of
      tools and platforms for development. The flexibility is simply amazing and
      it doesn't carry a price tag. An added benefit is the sense of community and
      that's priceless.</P
><P
>Enthusiasts never had it so good. There is aways something new to
      discover and since the system is totally transparent your chances of
      understanding computing and programming in general &#8211; you will be
      interested if you aren't already &#8211; are infinitely higher than in
      Windows. Tinkering will never be the same again.</P
><P
>For the home user &#8211; There are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5</TT
> separate
      areas here, the internet, 
      gaming, basic word processing, administration and multimedia. We aren't
      going to talk about ease of use here because the days of an ugly and
      unwieldy interface are long gone, at the moment as far as usability and
      sheer visual pizazz is concerned <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnome</SPAN
> has
      taken the pants off Windows so 
      there is nothing to worry about there. File management, installing and
      uninstalling software and basic administration are more streamlined and
      centralized and as you use Linux more you probably will get over any
      prejudice toward the command line which is nothing like the impotent 
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DOS</SPAN
> prompt. This is an outrageously powerful shell that
      will accomplish anything 
      you can think off faster than it takes you to select a button. You might be
      intimidated at first but its the heart of Linux the control centre, the
      headquarters, your direct line to the kernel. Hardware configuration is not
      as simple as in Windows mostly because plug and play has complicated things
      not eased them but it's not difficult either, the best thing to do is set
      your <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
> to <EM
>non pnp</EM
> so that it
      can configure things especially the sound 
      card, but <EM
>read read read</EM
>. There is a lot
      of documentation on your system and with that behind you everything
      becomes simple. There is no excuse for ignorance.</P

>Abiword</SPAN

	<A
HREF="http://www.abisource.com/"

	and bears an uncanny resemblance to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>MSWord</SPAN
>
	&#8211; now now. Both are free and
	widely available &#8211; I don't know about 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Wordperfect 9</SPAN

CLASS="APPLICATION"

	is free, good and available. Other options are 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Applixware</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Star
	  Office</SPAN
>. I haven't used <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Applix</SPAN
>
	but <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Star Office</SPAN
> is really ugly and slow and
	just the sort of software that could put you off Linux and its just as
	bad in Windows. Version 5.1 was tolerable but after Sun took it over its
	deteriorated and version 5.2 is the pits. Plain text and html editors are
	sprouting by the day. Most distribution carry a lot of software so
	look. I'm not much of a spreadsheet person but there is 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNUmeric</SPAN
> which is
	not unlike <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Excel</SPAN
> and a glaring inadequacy in
	printing is now rectified. It looks good. Corel have ported nearly all
	their apps and they are not as expensive as their Windows counterparts
	and with the same functionality.</P

>That leaves us with <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTP</SPAN
> and this is one area
	where Linux could pound Windows but the thrust has been missing. Linux could
	really be optimized for
	<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DTP</SPAN
>. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ghostscript</SPAN
> - a
	PostScript RIP &#8211; already 
	offers a professional (if you know how) solution for printing and your
	printer is probably supported. If you already have a postscript
	printer there is no problem to start with. For image editing there is
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gimp</SPAN
>. It is nearly as good as 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Photoshop</SPAN
> &#8211; and
	that's some compliment &#8211;
	but for lack of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>CMYK</SPAN
> and colour management support
	ruling it out of 
	serious print work but it can be a good semi-professional solution and
	for web work perfect and it's fun to
	use. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gimp</SPAN
> also has a couple of 
	good drivers for Epson printers. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ghostscript</SPAN
>
	has a problem with bitmaps &#8211; not all bitmaps but photographs, you
	could eventually get some good output but it will take some amount of
	tweaking. As far as text and vector graphics is concerned it's good
	enough to replace my Epson driver in Windows (it has a Windows
	version) <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GhostScript</SPAN
> is available at its
	homepage <A

      </P

>Word processing is already covered. The problem areas are
	vector editing and page layout. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Framemaker</SPAN
>
	for Linux is a solution and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CorelDraw</SPAN
> is
	available but they are both commercial offerings. There are 
	vector editors but all are at a nascent stage. 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Sketch</SPAN
>,
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Killustrator</SPAN
> and 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Impress</SPAN
> are coming along but far away from
	professional solutions like 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Draw</SPAN
> and 
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Adobe Illustrator</SPAN
>. For page layout there is
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tex</SPAN
> but those used  
	to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Pagemaker</SPAN
>,
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Quark</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>InDesign</SPAN
>
	are not going to be amused, its tough to
	learn and difficult to control and there are way too many issues with
	things like fonts and its not <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>wysiwyg</SPAN
> &#8211; we
	can't live without that.</P
><P
>On a last note at the moment the only difference in
	productivity for me is in vector graphics, page layout and games. They
	are perhaps a year away at which point Linux would have over taken
	Windows &#8211; at least as far as I'm concerned &#8211; and I would
	have little reason to dual boot but I think having Windows is in a odd
	way comforting as is having Linux, perhaps I will always use them
	both.</P
