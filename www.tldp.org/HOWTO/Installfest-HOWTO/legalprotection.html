>INSTALLFEST RELEASE FORM</P
><P
>&#13;        By signing this release agreement
        between you and the group holding the installfest (members of the
        __________________________ Linux User's Group, hereinafter 
        referred to as
        Installers), you give up certain legal rights. Therefore, you should
        read the agreement carefully. If you have any questions about the
        legal effect of this agreement, you should consult an attorney and
        not any of the Installers. Please be aware that you may not participate
        in the installfest event unless you have signed this agreement.
        By signing this release agreement, you
        acknowledge the following:

>&#13;            That your signing this agreement

></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            That Installers do not promise
            that the work done on your computer equipment will be successful.
            An Installer will help you attempt to install, configure, or
            otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on your computer
            equipment. However, because of possible defects in computer
            software or computer hardware, including improperly configured
            computer hardware, not every attempt is successful. 
            </P

><P
>&#13;            That the attempt to install,
            configure, or otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on
            your computer equipment has inherent dangers that no amount of
            care, caution, instruction, or expertise can eliminate. 
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            That any attempt to install,
            configure, or otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on
            your computer equipment, especially including any attempt to
            partition or re-partition your computer's hard drive, may result in
            the loss of some or all of the data stored on that hard drive. That
            you are hereby advised that you should back up all important data
            before the attempt to install, configure or otherwise get the Linux
            operating system to work on your computer equipment. 
            </P

>&#13;            That an installfest is an inherently chaotic event at which
            many computer components, peripherals and systems are present;
            therefore, you are responsible for the security of your property.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            That you are expressly assuming
            the risks of the dangers set forth above.

></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;            That by signing this release agreement, you hereby forever
            release the Installers from any legal liability they might have
            arising from the attempt to install, configure, or otherwise get
            the Linux operating system to run on your computer equipment. That
            this release includes, but is not limited to, any losses caused by
            the negligence of any Installer who attempts to install, configure
            or otherwise get the Linux operating system to work on your
            computer.
