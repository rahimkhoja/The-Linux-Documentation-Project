>&#13;                How much power does a computer need?
                Laptops need about 0.5 amps.
                For a desktop/tower/workstation type of computer
                the amount of power needed depends on the monitor, 
                number of disk drives, etc.
                Basically though, if everything is connected to one
                power strip, then they need at most 3 to 4 amps at the moment
                that the power is turned on and 1.5 to 2 amps while
                they are running.

                You may want to include minimum system requirements

                not show up with an old machine, hoping to turn it
