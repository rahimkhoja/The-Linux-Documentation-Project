<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Ispell</A>    </H2>

<P>If you want to spell-check your document from within Emacs, you may
use the <B>Ispell</B> package and its Emacs mode.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Choosing your default dictionaries</A>
     </H2>

<P>You can set up Emacs so that upon loading a file, it chooses
automatically which dictionaries to use (you can use several). The first
one, certainly the most important, is the main dictionary, distributed
with Ispell. You can choose among several languages. The second one is
your personal dictionary, where Ispell will insert words it couldn't
find in the main dictionary but you told it to remember. 
<P>If you wish to use as a default dictionary the French dictionary
that comes with Ispell, and if you wish to use the file
<CODE>.ispell-dico-perso</CODE> in your home directory as a personal
dictionary, insert the following lines in your <CODE>.emacs</CODE> file:
<P>
<PRE>
       (setq sgml-mode-hook
       '(lambda () "Defauts for SGML mode."
       (setq ispell-personal-dictionary "~/.ispell-dico-perso")
       (ispell-change-dictionary "francais")
       ))
       
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Selecting special dictionaries for certain files      </A>
</H2>

<P>You may have a little problem if you do not spell-check documents in
the same language at all times. If you translate documents, it is very
likely that you swap languages (and dictionaries) very often.
<P>
<P>I don't know of any Lisp way of selecting, either automatically, or
with a single mouse click, the main and personal dictionaries associated
to the language currently being used. (If you do, please tell me!)
<P>
<P>However, it is possible to indicate, at the end of the file, which
dictionaries you want to use for the current file (and only this one).
It suffices to add them as commentaries, so that Ispell can read them
upon launching a spell-check:
<P>
<PRE>
      &lt;!-- Local IspellDict: english -->
      &lt;!-- Local IspellPersDict: ~/emacs/.ispell-english -->
     
</PRE>
<P>If you have previously defined, in your <CODE>.emacs</CODE> file, that
your default dictionaries are the French dictionaries, then you can add
these lines in the end of any file written in English.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Spell-checking your document</A>
      </H2>

<P>To spell-check the whole of your document, use, from anywhere in
the document the <CODE>Meta-x ispell-buffer</CODE> command. You may as well
only run the checking on a region in your document:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Mark the beginning of the region with <CODE>Ctrl-Spc</CODE>
(mark-set-command),</LI>
<LI> Go to the end of the region to check,</LI>
<LI> type <CODE>Meta-x ispell-region</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Emacs then runs Ispell. Upon meeting an unknown word, this one
shows you said word (usually highlighted) and prompts you for a key:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>spc </B>accepts the word, this time only,</LI>
<LI><B>i </B>accepts the word and inserts it in your personal
dictionary, </LI>
<LI><B>a </B>accepts the word for this session,</LI>
<LI><B>A </B>accepts the word for this file, and inserts it
in the local file dictionary</LI>
<LI><B>r </B>allows you to correct the word by hand</LI>
<LI><B>R </B>allows you to correct all the occurrences of the
misspelled word,</LI>
<LI><B>x </B>stops the checking, and puts the cursor back in
place,</LI>
<LI><B>X </B>stops the checking and leaves the cursor where
it is, letting you correct your file; you will be able to continue the
spell-checking later if you type <CODE>Meta-x ispell-continue</CODE>,</LI>
<LI><B>? </B>gives you online help.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If ispell finds one or several words close to the unknown one, it
will show them in a little window, each one of them preceded by a digit.
Just type this digit to replace the misspelled word with the corresponding
word.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Personal dictionary versus local file dictionary</A>
      </H2>

<P>The <B>i</B> key will let you insert a word in your personal
dictionary, whereas <B>A</B> will let you insert a word in the local
file dictionary.
<P>
<P>The local file dictionary is a sequence of words inserted at the
end of the file, as comments, reread by Ispell each time it is run on
the file. This way, you can accept some words, acceptable in this file, 
but not necessarily acceptable in other files.
<P>
<P>As far as I am concerned, I think it is better that the personal
dictionary be reserved for words the main dictionary doesn't know but
which belong to the language (like hyphenated words), plus some common
words like proper nouns or others (like <I>Linux</I>), if they don't
look too much like a real word of the main dictionary; adding too many
words in the personal dictionary, such as first names, may be dangerous,
because they may look like a word of the language (one can imagine
Ispell being mystified on the following:
`<I>When the going gets tof, the tof get going</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Tof</EM> is a French abbreviation for the first name
<EM>Christophe</EM>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
'!).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Typing spell-checking</A>
      </H2>

<P>Ispell can spell-check your file while you're typing. You need to
use <B>ispell-minor-mode</B> for this. To start it or stop it, type
<CODE>Meta-x ispell-minor-mode</CODE>. Ispell will <EM>beep</EM> you each
time you type a word it doesn't know.
<P>
<P>If those <EM>beeps</EM> hassle you (or your roommate 
is taking a nap), you can replace those annoying <EM>beeps</EM> 
with a flash on the screen, with
the command <CODE>Meta-x set-variable RET visible-bell RET t RET</CODE>. You
can add the following line in your <CODE>.emacs</CODE> and silence Emacs 
forever:
<P>
<PRE>
       (setq visible-bell t)
