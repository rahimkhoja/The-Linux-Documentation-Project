<P>
<P>This HOWTO is not actually a HOWTO in the sense of the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/INDEX.html">Linux Documentation Project</A>.  Instead, it is an instrument to
investigate the commercial Linux opportunity and to list applications
which were already ported and marketed in a native Linux version.  As a
software vendor, you probably know that you can alternatively offer
Linux users a statically linked SCO version of your application which
would probably run under the iBCS2 emulator (albeit with a small
performance penalty and higher memory requirements).  Such applications
will not be listed here.
<P>I will not select nor deselect any particular product.  Instead, everyone
who wants to have her product included will be serviced.  However, I
reserve the right to shorten individual entries to keep things in shape.
<P>If you don't find a particular product or vendor in this list, this
is probably due to one of the following reasons: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>I never heard of that product or vendor and thus
didn't try to get in contact. </LI>
<LI>I did get in contact, but the vendor didn't
answer yet.</LI>
<LI>I did get in contact, but the vendor stated
positively that he doesn't sell his product for Linux (yet).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In any case, please get in contact if you feel someone's missing; also if
you discover any errors in the file.
<P>Sometimes two vendor's addresses are mentioned in the
``Vendor:'' field.  In these cases I received the information from
the German subsidiary/distributor.  The original
manufacturer's address is always mentioned first.
