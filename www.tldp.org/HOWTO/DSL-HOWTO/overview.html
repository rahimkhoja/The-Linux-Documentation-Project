><P
> DSL is a telephone loop technology that uses existing copper phones lines, 
 and provides a dedicated, high speed Internet connection. One of the big
 advantages of some DSLs (notably ADSL), are that they can co-exist on the
 same line with a traditional voice service such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"POTS"</SPAN
> (Plain
 Old Telephone Service), and even ISDN. This is accomplished by utilizing
 different frequency ranges above the voice range (voice is up to 4KHz).
 Essentially, this gives two lines in one: one for voice, and one for Internet
 connectivity. When all is working normally, there should be no interference
 between the two <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lines"</SPAN
>. This gives DSL a potentially broad
 consumer base, and helps minimize costs for service providers.&#13;</P
><P
> DSL is positioned for the Home and Small Office (SOHO) market that is 
 looking for high speed Internet access at reasonable prices. Since it also
 typically provides dedicated, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"always on"</SPAN
> access, it can be used
 for interconnecting low to mid range bandwidth servers, and provides a great
 access solution for small LANs. It is also great for those Linux power users
 that just want a fat pipe  :-).&#13;</P
><P
> Phone companies, and other independent telecommunications providers (CLECs),
 are now deploying DSL to stay ahead of the Cable
 companies -- the main consumer and SOHO competition for DSL providers. This
 mad rush to get <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a piece of the pie"</SPAN
>, is bringing much
 competition (a good thing!), much diversity, and some confusion, into the
 consumer market. The DSL provider (often, but not always, the phone company)
 will provide the DSL infrastructure. This would include your line, the DSLAM,
 and physical connection to the outside world. From there it is typically
 picked up by an ISP, who provides the traditional Internet services.
 </P
><P
> Consumer DSL plans are typically <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"best effort"</SPAN
> services. While
 boasting speeds approaching T1, and even surpassing that in some cases, it is
 not necessarily as reliable as T1 however. Business class DSL offers more
 reliability at a higher cost than consumer plans, and is a good compromise
 where both reliability and bandwidth are at a premium. All in all, the cost
 of DSL compared to traditional telco services, such as T1, is attractive and
 substantially more affordable for home and small business users.&#13;</P
><P
> DSL providers often do not have service contracts for home users,
 while business class DSL services typically do include similar SLAs (Service
 Level Agreements) to that offered for a T1 line.&#13;</P
><P
> The downside is that DSL is not available everywhere. Availability, and
 available bit rate (speed), are purely a function of where you live, where
 the telco has installed the prerequisite hardware, how far you are from the
 DSLAM/CO, and the quality of your phone line (loop). Not all loops are
 created equal, unfortunately. The primary limitation is distance.&#13;</P

   ADSL is far and away the most widely deployed consumer DSL, and was
   specifically developed for the home and SOHO markets. The higher downstream
   rates lends itself to those not running serious servers -- at least
   anything more than a small, personal web site. ADSL is capable of sharing
   data with a POTS (or ISDN) voice line, so an additional line is not
   required. A big selling point. ADSL, like other DSLs, is limited by
   distance. 18,000 ft (5.5 km) is a typical cut-off point for telcos. ADSL
   does typically require either a splitter or filters to isolate the DSL
   signal from POTS. Sometimes referred to as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"full rate"</SPAN
> ADSL in
   order to differentiate it from G.Lite DSL. There are two line encodings for
   ADSL: DMT and CAP. DMT (a.k.a. Alcatel compatible) has won the standards
   battle and is now the standard and the most common. Also, note that modems
   must be compatible with the encoding. In other words, a CAP modem will not
   work with a DMT service, and vice versa. Also, ISDN requires
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"modems"</SPAN
> (NTs), and related hardware such as filters, that are
   specific to that type of line since the signal on the line is very
   different for POTS and ISDN.

   some T1) which is considered more robust than the DMT or CAP encoding of

 DSLAMs come in various shapes and sizes, and are the one, single complex and
 costly component of a DSL connection. When a qualified phone line is
 connected to a modem at the user's end of the loop, a high speed digital
 connection is established, typically over ATM, or sometimes frame relay. The
 DSLAM splits the signal back into separate voice and data channels. The voice
 channel stays within the telco network, whereas the data is picked up by an
 ISP (typically).&#13;</P

 Without sync, nothing happens. The modem will establish a sync rate which is
 often throttled by the provider at a predefined limit. This limit, or

> The attainable sync rate is the result of a number of factors, including wire
 distance to the DSLAM, quality of both inside and outside wiring, the loop
 wire gauge and various other factors within the loop.  Actual measurable,
 real world throughput, on the other hand, is first of all dependent on sync
 rate. Low sync rate means low throughput. In the above example, had the sync
 rate been lower, say 500 Kbps, then that would be the maximum for that
 connection, even though the customer is paying for a 1.5 Mbps service.</P

 Secondarily, throughput will depend also on the ISP's network, and then the
 ISP's upstream provider.  You will lose approximately 10-20% of potential
 throughput to networking overhead. In the above example where the connection
 is throttled at 1.5 Mbps, the actual, real-world maximum throughput would be
 somewhere around 1.2-1.3 Mbps when overhead is taken into account. Moreover,
 once you hit the Internet proper, all bets are off as there are any number of
 factors that may impact throughput. A overloaded or busy server is likely to
 be slow no matter how fast your DSL connection is. &#13;</P

 other modem options (PCI, USB, onboard) will not work due to a lack of
 drivers at this time! All ethernet based modems will work fine. (See the

 offer a compatible modem as an option, then you either need to look
 elsewhere, or you will have to buy one outright from a third party.&#13;</P

 IteX PCI ADSL modems, based on the Apollo chipset, have Linux drivers.
 (Modems using this chipset are sold under a number of various brand names.)
 Diamond also makes [made?] an internal PCI modem which has binary-only
 drivers, but it is not in widespread use, and seems to be discontinued at
 this point. It is also possible to make a direct ATM connection using a modem
 plus an ATM network card, though this delivery system is not used in the U.S.
 as far as I know, and should not be considered as a viable option. This would
 also require a 2.4 kernel.&#13;</P

 more than one modem option. Some may give away the modem at no additional

 better models with more features. Many of the modems that ISPs supply are not
 available through normal retail channels. Should you want to buy one
 yourself, this leaves used equipment outlets (e.g. ebay), or possibly buying
 a modem that your ISP may not support (i.e. a possibility of no tech support
 if you have a problem). </P
><P
> While some ISPs provide modems that are not readily available through normal

 DSL modem bandwagon, and offering a good selection. Most have a
 number of enhancements. At this time Alcatel (now owned by Thomson), Intel,
 Zyxel, Cisco, 3Com, and Cayman have products available. Depending on model
 and feature set, prices range from a little over $100 US to $800 and up. Many
 of these handle their own authentication and encapsulation (DHCP, PPPoE,

 </P
><P
> Are some modems better than others? Short, easy answer: no. Modems are not
 much of a factor in speed in most cases. But some do have enhanced features,
 such as diagnostics or the combo modem/routers. Ethernet modems are
 generally considered the most reliable. Fewer IRQ hassles, no buggy drivers,
 etc. So the fact that Linux users are mostly relegated to ethernet modems is
 a blessing in disguise really. Are any of these better than others? Hard to
 say since most of this is so new there is not enough of a track record to
 compare brands and models with any degree of assurance. In other words, any
 old external, ethernet modem should do -- provided it matches your
 provider's DSL, and is configured for that service. Remember, there can be
 differences here.&#13;</P

 of the telco/DSL provider. The ISP will connect to the telco's ATM network

 possibly an OC-3 (155 Mbps). The important thing here is that an ISP must

 this much. It can be a fairly involved process, with a variety of different
 tests being run. There are a number of things that may

CLASS="QUOTE"

><P
> 
 All DSLs have distance limitations. ADSL is limited
 to a loop length of roughly 18,000 ft (5.5 km), but the actual cut off point
 will vary from provider to provider. The further away you are, the weaker the
 signal, and the potential for poor connections is greater. With ADSL, if you
 are within approximately 12,000 ft (3.7 km), you should be able to get at
 least 1.5 Mbps -- all other things being equal. IDSL has even greater reach,
 mainly because the maximum speed for IDSL is considerably lower at 144
 Kbps/144 Kbps.&#13;</P
><P
> Still even if you're close enough, there are a number of potential
 impediments that may disqualify a line. Two such common impediments
 are load coils and bridge taps. These are aspects of the old telco
 infrastructure that once were deemed beneficial, but now are getting
 in the way of the newer, digital technologies.  
 Whether you hit a snag like this or not, is pretty much hit or miss.  Fiber
 anywhere in the loop is also a disqualifier. The provider may take steps to
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"clean"</SPAN
> the line. Just how far they are willing to go will vary
 from provider to provider, and this will likely add additional time to the
 installation process.&#13;</P
><P
> Once the line is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"qualified"</SPAN
>, the next step is deciding on which
 plan is suitable for your situation.  The provider may have differing plans
 available depending on how strong a signal they think your line can handle.
 If you are marginal, you will not be qualified for the higher speed plans.
 And if price is a factor, having a tiered pricing structure is good also
 since the lower end plans are obviously less expensive. How this is
 structured also varies wildly from provider to provider. Since, DSL is a new
 service, and providers are trying to find the right price/feature
 combinations that will attract the most users and thus gain a competitive
 edge.

 Calculating the effective loop length is by no means an exact science. There
 is plenty of room for errors. Also, some providers may go to greater lengths
 to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

 phone line, and are disqualified, then try the other line. Just because they
