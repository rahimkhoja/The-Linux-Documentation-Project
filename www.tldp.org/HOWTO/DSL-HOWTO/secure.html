> This section is intended for those who have not previously dealt with the
 security implications of having a full-time Internet connection. Or may not
 understand some of the basic concepts of security. This is meant to be just a
 quick overview, not a comprehensive examination of all the issues! Just
 enough to give you a gentle shove in the right direction. Please see the <A
HREF="appendix.html#LINKS"
>Links section</A
> for sites with more details. Also, your
 distribution surely has plenty of good information as well.&#13;</P

> Before going on-line full-time, do not underestimate the need for securing
 your connection. You will have two things that mischief makers and crackers
 of the world are looking for: bandwidth, and a Unix-like OS. You instantly
 become an inviting target. It is just a matter of time before someone
 comes knocking. Possibly a very short time. A quick start:

>    Turn off any daemons and services that aren't absolutely essential, and
    can be accessed from outside. You can't get compromised through a port
    that isn't open. Use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ps</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>netstat</B
>
    to see what services are running. (See man pages for specifics). Do you
    really need <B

>named</B

CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
>,
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B

>ftp</B
> running and accessible
    to one and all? If not sure, then they should not be running. Then take
    whatever steps necessary to make sure they don't start again on the next
    boot. See your distribution's documentation on this.
  
   </P
><P
>    Many distributions start some well known services by default. You may not
    have done anything yourself explicitly to start these. And may not even
    realize these are indeed running. But it is up to you to know what is
    running, and how safe it is. Don't rely on a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"default"</SPAN
>
    installation of any distribution to do this for you, or to be secure.
    Chances are it isn't. 
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    If you decide some services are essential, make sure you are running the
    most current version. Exploits are found, and then get fixed quickly.
    Don't get caught with your pants down. A full-time connection makes
    staying updated very easy -- and very important. Check with your
    distribution to see what new packages are available. Then stay in
    touch. If they have a security mailing list, get on it.

    shadow passwords (this should be a standard feature of newer
    distributions). Do not allow remote root logins. See the
