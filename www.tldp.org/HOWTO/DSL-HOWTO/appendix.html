NAME="CABLE">8.3.1. Cable Modem vs DSL</H3
><P
> The Telcos see DSL as a competitor to the Cable Company's Cable
 Modem, and as such, are providing competitive pricing and configuration
 offerings. Although Cable Modems are advertised as having 10-30Mbps potential 
 bandwidth, they use a shared transmission medium with many other users on the
 same line, and therefore performance may vary, sometimes greatly, with the amount
 of traffic, time of day, and number of other users on the same node. But YMMV.&#13;</P
><P
> It is often heard that DSL has an advantage in that it is a private pipe to
 the Internet, with dedicated bandwidth. This is mostly a myth. You do have a
 private pipe to the DSLAM, but at that point, you enter the telco's ATM (or
 frame relay) network, and start sharing bandwidth. You are at the mercy of
 how well your DSL provider and ISP manage their networks. The consensus seems
 to be that DSL providers and ISPs are mostly doing a better job of managing
 bandwidth than the Cable companies. It is easier for them to add and adjust
 bandwidth as needed to meet demand. You are less likely to have speed
 fluctuations due to other users being on line at the same time. But, again,
 this gets down to how well the specific network and bandwidth are managed.&#13;</P
><P
> DSL probably has a small security advantage too. With most Cable modem
 networks, it is like being on a big LAN. You are sharing your connection (and
 bandwidth) right at the point of connection. But if you are not doing
 something to filter incoming connections already, you are asking for trouble
 either way. And, the cable companies are addressing this now, with more 
 secure approaches. This should not now be a major deciding factor.</P
><P
> There also seems to be a better chance of having ISP alternatives with DSL
 than Cable. At least, in the U.S. this is true. Choice is a good thing, and
 so is competition. It seems most Cable outfits give you just one choice for
 an ISP. If you don't like it, you are out of luck. The number of options with
 DSL probably varies greatly by geographic areas. Populous areas, like
 Northeast U.S., seem to have many options. </P
><P
> So which is better? The differences aren't as much with the technology, as they
 are with the implementations. If you look around, you can find plenty of
 horror stories on either. And plenty of happy customers too. The way
 to know what may be the best for you, is to do comparative shopping based on
 experiences of other users in your area. Don't base your choice on one
 person's opinion. This is statistically invalid. Likewise, don't base your
 choice on someone's opinion who has had a particular service for only a short
 time. Again, statistically not worth much. Get as many opinions from those
 that are using the <EM
>exact same services</EM
> that you are
 looking at.

 instead of the traditional telco copper lines. While the fiber is a definite
 problem for DSL services, it has it's own potential advantages. Existing
 fiber is potentially capable of 100 Mbps, and it looks like this could easily
 go up soon. 
 </P
><P
> So while telco fiber customers are being shut out of the DSL market 
 (since DSL is a copper only technology), they may have much to look forward
 to. Technologies are under development, and in some cases just now being
 deployed, to take advantage of fiber telco phone loops. Known as
 <SPAN

> (Integrated
 Fiber In The Loop), this technology is another high speed service that telcos
 can offer. The speeds are sufficient for VoD (Video on Demand) and VoDSL
 (Voice over DSL), and other high bandwidth services. One nice advantage here
 is, that since there is no DSL signal on the wire, the only required CPE is a
 network card. In other words, no modem -- just connect a NIC to the wall jack
 and off you go! This will also allow the telco to provide other digital
 services such digital TV. &#13;</P

 certainly seem to have a place in the broadband market, especially for areas
 that don't have ready access to cable or telco networks. There are still
 some inherent problems with the current state of this technology that may prevent
 it from becoming a major player in the near term however. Weather can still
 impact the wireless signal -- heavy cloud cover or rain for instance. Also,
 there is some pretty hefty latency if the uplink is via satellite. Surely
 these drawbacks will improve over time. But how soon?

> What I did is setup a Linux router (Redhat Linux 5.0  on a i486) with two
 ethernet interfaces. One interface routes to the ISP subnet/gateway (eth0 in
 above example), and the other interface (eth1 above) goes to a hub (or switch)
 and then connects the LAN with private network addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.x).
 Using the private network addresses behind your router/firewall allows some
 additional security because it is not directly addressable from outside. You
 have to explicitly masquerade your private addresses in order to connect to
 the Internet from the LAN. The LAN hosts will access the Internet via the
 second NIC (eth1) in the Linux router. Just set their gateway to the IP
 address of the second NIC, and assign them addresses on the same network.&#13;</P
