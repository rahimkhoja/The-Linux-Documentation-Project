<H2><A NAME="s11">11. Third Example: Fortune</A></H2>

<P>This example requires some knowledge of C programming. The majority
of UNIX/Linux software is written in C, and learning at least a little
bit of C would certainly be an asset for anyone serious about software
installation.
<P>The notorious <EM>fortune</EM> program displays up a humorous saying, a
"fortune cookie", every time Linux boots up. Unfortunately (pun intended),
attempting to build fortune on a Red Hat distribution with a 2.0.30
kernel generates fatal errors.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
~/fortune# make all

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Looking at <CODE>fortune.c</CODE>, the pertinent lines are these.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   if (dirent->d_namlen == 0)
            continue;
        name = copy(dirent->d_name, dirent->d_namlen);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We need to find the structure <CODE>dirent</CODE>, but it is not declared in
the <EM>fortune.c</EM> file, nor does a <B>grep dirent</B> show it in
any of the other source files. However, at the top of
<EM>fortune.c</EM>, there is the following line.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#include &lt;dirent.h>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This appears to be a system library include file, therefore, the logical
place to look for <EM>dirent.h</EM> is in <EM>/usr/include</EM>.
Indeed, there does exist a <EM>dirent.h</EM> file in
<EM>/usr/include</EM>, but that file does not contain the declaration of
the <CODE>dirent</CODE> structure.  There is, however, a reference to
another <EM>dirent.h</EM> file.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#include &lt;linux/dirent.h>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>At last, going to <EM>/usr/include/linux/dirent.h</EM>, we find the
structure declaration we need.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
struct dirent {
        long            d_ino;
        __kernel_off_t  d_off;
        unsigned short  d_reclen;
        char            d_name[256]; /* We must not include
limits.h! */
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sure enough, the structure declaration contains no <EM>d_namelen</EM>,
but there are a couple of "candidates" for its equivalent. The most
likely of these is <EM>d_reclen</EM>, since this structure member
probably represents the length of something and it is a short integer.
The other possibility, <EM>d_ino</EM>, could be an inode number, judging
by its name and type. As a matter of fact, we are probably dealing with
a "directory entry" structure, and these elements represent attributes
of a file, its name, inode, and length (in blocks).  This would seem to
validate our guess.
<P>Let us edit the file <CODE>fortune.c</CODE>, and change the two
<EM>d_namelen</EM> references in lines 551 and 553 to <EM>d_reclen</EM>.
Try a <EM>make all</EM> again. <B>Success.</B> It builds without
errors. We can now get our "cheap thrills" from fortune.
