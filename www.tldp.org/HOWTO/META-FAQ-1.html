<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>What is Linux?</B><DD><P>Linux is an independent implementation of the POSIX operating system
specification, with SYSV and BSD extensions, that has been written
entirely from scratch (this means it looks and acts just like Unix).
It has no proprietary code in it.  Linux is freely
distributable under the GNU General Public License.
<P>Linux works on IBM PC
compatibles with an ISA or EISA bus (including local bus variants VLB
and PCI) and a 386 or higher processor.
Some Amiga and Atari computers with MMU's are also supported.
This means 68020 with an external MMU, 68030, 68040, or 68060.
Support for the Digital Alpha is now stable.
Red Hat and Craftworks have Alpha distributions of Linux.
Support for Sparc is stable, and Red Hat Linux is available for Sparc.
Support for PowerPC is in development for multiple platforms,
including Nubus and PCI Macintosh, Motorola Powerstack, IBM
830 and 850, and other platforms.
Support for ARM, StrongARM, and MIPS is in various stages of
completion, but don't hold your breath.
Read comp.os.linux.announce instead.
<P>See the Linux INFO-SHEET for more technical information on these
ports, and the Hardware Compatibility HOWTO for more exact hardware
requirements.
<P>The Linux kernel
is written by Linus Torvalds &lt;torvalds@transmeta.com&gt;
and other volunteers.  Most of the programs running under
Linux are generic Unix freeware, many of them from the GNU project.
<P>
<DT><B>The Linux INFO-SHEET</B><DD><P>More specific technical information on Linux.  Includes pointers
to information on the various ports, a feature list, information
about how to get Linux, and more.
<P>
<DT><B>The Linux HOWTO's</B><DD><P>These are somewhat like FAQ's, but instead of answering common
questions, they explain how to do common tasks, like ordering
a release of Linux, setting up print services under Linux,
setting up a basic UUCP feed, etc.  See
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX.html</A> or
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/</A>
for the definitive versions
of all the HOWTO's.  Other sites with up-to-date copies of
the HOWTOs are ftp.cc.gatech.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.
<P>In addition, there are many short, free-form documents called
"mini-HOWTOs".  These documents cover very specific subjects,
such as BogoMIPS or Color-ls.  These are available at
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini/</A>
and at

<P>
<DT><B>Linux newsgroups</B><DD><P>There are several Usenet newsgroups for Linux.
It is a good idea to follow at least comp.os.linux.announce if you
use Linux.  comp.os.linux.announce is moderated by
Lars Wirzenius.  To make submissions to the newsgroup, send mail to
linux-announce@news.ornl.gov.  You may direct questions about
comp.os.linux.announce to Lars Wirzenius &lt;wirzeniu@iki.fi&gt;
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated
newsgroup for announcements about Linux (new programs, bug
fixes, etc).
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.answers is a moderated newsgroup
to which the Linux FAQ, HOWTO documents, and other
documentation postings are made.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.setup is an unmoderated newsgroup
for discussion of issues and problems involved in setting up
Linux systems.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.admin is an unmoderated
newsgroup for discussion of administration of Linux systems.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development.system is an
unmoderated newsgroup specifically for discussion of Linux
<B>kernel</B> development.  The only application development
questions that should be discussed here are those that are
intimately associated with the kernel.  All other
development questions are probably generic Unix development
questions and should be directed to a comp.unix group
instead, unless they are very Linux-specific applications
questions, in which case they should be directed at
comp.os.linux.development.apps.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development.apps is an
unmoderated newsgroup specifically for discussion of
Linux-related applications development.  It is not for
discussion of where to get applications for Linux, nor a
discussion forum for those who would like to see
applications for Linux.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.hardware is for Linux-specific
hardware questions.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.networking is for Linux-specific
networking development and setup questions.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.x is for Linux-specific X
Windows questions.
<P>The newsgroup comp.os.linux.misc is an unmoderated newsgroup for any
Linux discussion that doesn't belong anywhere else.
<P>In general, <B>do not</B> crosspost between the Linux newsgroups.
The <B>only</B> crossposting that is appropriate is an occasional
posting between one unmoderated group and comp.os.linux.announce.  The
whole point of splitting the old comp.os.linux group into many groups
was to reduce
traffic in each.  Those that do not follow this rule will be flamed
without mercy...
<P>
<DT><B>Other newsgroups</B><DD><P>Do not assume that all your questions are appropriate for a Linux
newsgroup just because you are running Linux.  Is your question
really about shell programming under any unix or unix clone?  Then
ask in comp.unix.shell.  Is it about GNU Emacs?  Then try asking in
gnu.emacs.help.  Also, if you don't know another group to ask in, but
think there might be, politely ask in your post if there is another
group that would be more appropriate for your question.  At least
the groups comp.unix.{questions,shell,programming,bsd,admin} and
comp.windows.x.i386unix should be useful for a Linux user.

<DT><B>Linux Journal</B><DD><P>A magazine called <EM>Linux Journal</EM> was launched several
years ago.  It includes articles intended for almost all
skill levels, and is intended to be helpful to all Linux
users.  Subscriptions are $22 in the U.S., $27
in Canada and Mexico, and $32 elsewhere around the
world, all payable in U.S. funds. Subscription inquiries can
be sent via email to subs@ssc.com or faxed to (U.S.)
1-206-782-7191 or mailed to Linux Journal, PO Box 85867,
Seattle, WA 98145-1867 USA.  SSC has a PGP public key if
you wish to send your credit card number via encrypted
