<P>The sole and only reason why you, the reader, is engulfing yourself in reading 
this material along with a nice warm container full with java, is so that you:
<UL>
<LI>Wish to make a self-supportive box with only four cables sticking out of it: an RJ-45 network cable, a power cable, and two RCA cables (or just one 1/8 mini stereo plug).</LI>
<LI>Have all your mp3's on a big-server, while this MP3-box would fetch the files from the server.</LI>
<LI>Have no floppy driver, no video card, nor any harddrive in the MP3-box. Just a power supply, sound card, network card, memory, cpu, and a serial infrared receiver.</LI>
<LI>Be the envy of your friends :=)</LI>
<LI>Play your mp3's using your remote without having to turn on your workstation.
</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Design </A>
</H2>

<P>Its important to keep certain things in mind:
<UL>
<LI>Size of the computer component (I was tempted to use PC104 boards, but 
they were to expensive). Height of ISA/PCI cards (so that the box doesn't 
look like a baby-AT case).</LI>
<LI>The appealing side of the box - does it look like a square rectangle,
pyramid, triangle, or something even more weird?</LI>
<LI>Paint. Do you want see-through box with flashing lights inside, 
inconspicuous black box, or chrome looking?</LI>
<LI>Cost. The absolute minimum (taking into 
consideration that you, the reader, has no spare computer parts) is about $70 
(excluding tax, shipping, etc)</LI>
<LI>KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) - take everything that's unnecessary and
get rid of it (parallel port, modem card, video card, etc).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The idea behind this box is to separate tasks - the MP3-box can
only play the mp3's from a server, while you, the reader, can freely
add more files to your big-end server. Thus, the MPEG-box wouldn't
need a harddrive, nor floppy drive. It would boot the operating
system from the network (from the same server where the mp3 files are
located).
