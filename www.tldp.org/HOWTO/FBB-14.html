<P>This is not the first release of this mini-HOWTO. I
hope to improve it whenever possible. Besides that,
there are other documents that may help you to
use amateur radio stuff on your computer. You can
also look for AX.25 (mini-)HOWTO at the same 
location where you get this FBB mini-HOWTO.</P>
<P><EM>This mini-HOWTO would be improved from time 
to time. If you think that the HOWTO on your 
Linux installation CD is some out-of-date, you
may check for newest release on the Internet. It
could be found within the main 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> or some of its
mirrors.</EM></P>

</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!HOWTOs
-->

These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <CODE>Bootdisk</CODE>, <CODE>Installation</CODE>,  <CODE>SCSI</CODE> and <CODE>UMSDOS</CODE>.
The main site for these is the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">LDP archive</A>
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss14.6">14.6</A> <A HREF="FBB.html#toc14.6">Mini-HOWTO</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!mini-HOWTOs
-->

These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<CODE>Backup-With-MSDOS</CODE>, <CODE>Diskless</CODE>, <CODE>LILO</CODE>, <CODE>Large Disk</CODE>,
<CODE>Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+OS2+DOS</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+Win95</CODE>,
<CODE>Linux+WindowsNT</CODE>, <CODE>Linux+NT-Loader</CODE>, <CODE>NFS-Root</CODE>, 
<CODE>Win95+Win+Linux</CODE>, <CODE>ZIP Drive</CODE>, <CODE>FBB packet-radio BBS</CODE> etc.
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <CODE>mini</CODE>. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss14.7">14.7</A> <A HREF="FBB.html#toc14.7">Local Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>

In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc">/usr/doc</A> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO">/usr/doc/HOWTO</A>)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<A HREF="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini</A>)
of plain text documents.</P>
<P>Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<A HREF="file:///etc">/etc</A>
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<A HREF="file:///etc/fstab">/etc/fstab</A>
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<A HREF="file:///etc/mdtab">/etc/mdtab</A>
file that is used for the <CODE>md</CODE> system to set up RAID.</P>
<P>The kernel source in
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux">/usr/src/linux</A>
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <EM>use the source, Luke</EM>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<A HREF="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation">documentation directory</A>.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.</P>
<P>Also have a look in your system log file (
<A HREF="file:///var/log/messages">/var/log/messages</A>)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <CODE>tail -f /var/log/messages</CODE>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.</P>
<P>You can also take advantage of the 
<A HREF="file:///proc">/proc</A>
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <CODE>cat</CODE> rather than <CODE>more</CODE> to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <CODE>less</CODE> works well here.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss14.8">14.8</A> <A HREF="FBB.html#toc14.8">Web Pages</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!--
disk!information resources!WWW
-->

<!--
disk!information resources!web pages
-->

There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.</P>
<P>A good starting point is of course the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> home page, or this one: 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A>,
an information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.</P>
<P>Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.</P>
