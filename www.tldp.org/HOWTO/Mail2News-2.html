<P>Why would you want to post mailing list traffic to local news groups?
<P>
<P>Should more than one user subscribe to the same mailing list, there is
going to be traffic duplication.  By subscribing the site to a list
(if this is allowed by the list owner) and 'gating' the email traffic
to the local news server, it is possible to make mailing lists
accessible to all site users, or, using the security features of
'innd', to limit the access to certain users.  Such a site
subscription (particularly if there are a number of high traffic
lists) can make worthwhile savings in bandwidth usage.
<P>
<P>Also, reading list traffic via a newsreader offers the advantages of
threading and scoring/killfiles which tend not to be available in all
mailreaders.  And, of course, it keeps your inbox free free for
possibly more urgent, personal email.
<P>
<P>This mini-HOWTO describes setting up the 'mail2news' script to
accomplish this.
