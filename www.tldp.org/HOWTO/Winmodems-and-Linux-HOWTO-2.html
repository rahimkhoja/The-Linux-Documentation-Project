<P>Ok, now we have a Winmodem... But there are two types of Winmodems: ISA or PCI. For making the things harder, the two interfaces are pretty different. So, we'll now test if we have a PCI or ISA modem. First, you must configure your kernel. During the make *config, you must answer 'yes' to the following questions: 
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In Loadable module support: 'Enable loadable module support (CONFIG_MODULES)', and 'Set version information on all modules for symbols (CONFIG_MODVERSIONS)' (note that you must have the modutils package installed ; See the Kerneld-HOWTO)</LI>
<LI>In General setup: <P>'PCI support' (CONFIG_PCI)
<P>Choose 'Any' in 'PCI Access Mode' (CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS)
<P>'PCI quirks' (CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS)
<P>'Backward compatible /proc/pci' (CONFIG_PCI_OLD_PROC)
<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you can config PCI Device Name Database (maybe with a 2.4+ kernel), your can say Y, this will make your /proc/pci file easier to understand (CONFIG_PCI_NAMES).</LI>
<LI>In Filesystems<P>'/proc filesystem support' (CONFIG_PROC_FS)
<P>
</LI>
</UL>

If you have never recompiled your kernel, maybe the kernel of your distribution will contains this. If you want to recompile it and you have never done it, read the Kernel-HOWTO. 
<P>
<P>Now, we assume that your new kernel is installed. 
<P>
<P>Now run 'cat /proc/pci'. If you see the name of your modem in the lines returned by the command then you have a PCI Winmodem. Jump to 'Installing the driver'
<P>

</H2>

<P>If you don't find it, maybe you have an ISA modem. How to be sure ?
<P>ISA support is not assumed by the Kernel (UPDATED: if you have a
2.4.x kernel, the kernel can do it automagically for you, if so, skip this
section and read the next). It is a third-party software, named isapnp, who does
it. First you must be sure that you have this package installed. If not install
it by downloading the isapnptools package. 
<P>Once isapnptools is installed,
we'll run a special program, pnpdump, who inspects your computer
for finding ISA devices. Then it tries to guess the
resources used by the devices and prints them to a file,
/etc/isapnp.conf. Then you edit this file and run an other
program, isapnp, which reads the isapnp.conf file and auto
configure your devices. 
<P> 
<P> Eh ? It sounds hard ? Then
follow these steps: 
<P> 
<P> 1. Run 'pnpdump >
/etc/isapnp.conf'. 
<P>2. Edit it with your favourite text
editor
<P> 3. Locate the section where your modem is
described. 
<P>4. Uncomment some lines in the file (Remove
the # at the beginning of the line. You need: 
<P> 1 line
'(IO 0 ...)'
<P> 1 line '(INT 0 ...)'
<P> 1 line '(DMA 0
...)'
<P> 1 line '(DMA 1 ...)'
<P> 1 line '(IO 1...)'
<P> 5.
Remove the '(CHECK)' in all uncommented IO lines
<P> 6. Run
'isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf'. If you get errors, edit the file
isapnp.conf and try changing parameters, help you with the
error message. If you get no errors, edit isapnp.conf and
uncomment the '(ACT Y)' line in the secton of your modem.
Then re-run 'isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf'. It must answer you "
[[Name of your modem]] Enabled OK"
<P> 7. Add 'isapnp
/etc/isapnp.conf' to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local, by typing
'echo "isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local'. It
is useful for auto-configuring your devices at each
startup
<P> 
<P> If it can help , here is an extract of my
/etc/isapnp.conf file (I have commented this file, and
original file comments are preceded by ##)

</H2>

<P>If you have a 2.4 kernel (launch 'uname -r' to get your kernel version), you don't have to do this tricky textfile-based and third-party package installation, since 2.4 series introduce a method similar to the PCI, and obsoletes the isapnptools package. To get this feature, you have to say 'Y' or 'M' to the 'Plug and Play support' (CONFIG_PNP) and 'ISA Plug and Play support' (CONFIG_ISAPNP) during kernel configuration (it is in 'Plug and Play configuration' section). Again, recompile your kernel and install it. If you said 'M' to ISA Plug-and-Play support, it should be good  to do a 'modprobe isapnp'. You have to have a driver compliant with this new device access method (eg. the ltmodem 5.78, read the next section).
