<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>The directions below will produce the RedHat (currently version 6.2 is used,
7.0 is in development) Linux system that boots into the bare (=no window
manager, like gnome, kde or fvwm2) X server and starts Netscape Navigator (not
Communicator, which includes Main and News clients). Upon exiting the browser
the X server is restarted and the new Netscape process is launched as
needed. The system is intended for Internet Kiosks and similar applications.
Security is emphasized at all the stages of the setup.
<P>This HOWTO will be updated (maybe significantly) as long as more reports about the deployment of
such boxes will arrive.
