>Every Linux user has been sooner or later trapped in a situation in
	 which having working <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Delete</B
>
	 keys on the console and on X seemed impossible. This paper explains why
	 this happens and suggests solutions. The notions given here are essentially
	 distribution-independent: due to the widely different content of system
	 configuration files in each distribution, I will try to give the reader
	 enough knowledge to think up his/her own fixes, if necessary.</P
><P
>I assume that the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> key should go back one
	 character and then erase the character under the cursor. On the other hand,
	 the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Delete</B
> key should delete the character under the
	 cursor, without moving it. If you think that the function of the two keys
	 should be exchanged, in spite of the fact that most keyboards feature an
	 arrow pointing to the <EM
>left</EM
> (<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>&#8592;</B
>)
	 on the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> key, then this paper will not give you
	 immediate solutions, but certainly you may find the explanations given here
	 useful.</P
><P
>Another assumption is that the fixes should alter only local (user)
	 files. No standard part of the distribution should be altered. Finally,
	 this document discusses how to set up your system so that applications get
	 the right events. If an application decides to interpret such events in an
	 idiosyncratic way, the only possible fix is to reconfigure the
	 application.</P

>Since the first release of this Mini-HOWTO things have become even
    more entangled. Different distributions of the same terminal emulator
    (e.g., <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>gnome-terminal</SPAN
> as provided by Red Hat
    7.0, Helix Code/Ximian or even Red Hat&#8805;7.1) generate different
    <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ASCII</SPAN
> sequences. Due to this mismatch, now the terminal
    databases correspond even less to the terminal emulators they are supposed
    to describe. To set a firm ground for the following discussion, we assume
    basically as correct settings the ones proposed in the <A
