<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Phase Change Optical Technology </A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>Optical Phase Change technology is used to create "In Phase" or "Out of
Phase" bits on a special media for phase change writing. The drive uses a
LASER of different power levels or LASER intensities to produce this effect.
One power level allows the media to flow into a crystalline form while the
other creates an "Out of Phase" condition. The crystallized areas reflect the
read Lasers beam with a different coefficient of reflectivity than the
non-crystallized areas. Thus, data can be read from the disk. 
<P>
<P>What makes the phase change optical disk special is that it the disk is
formatted with concentric cylinders or tracks with each track being sectored
much like a magnetic disk or read/write optical disk. The tracks are very close
so a lot of data can be stored on a disk. This is different from a CD-ROM in
that it gives your system the look and feel of a magnetic disk. CD-ROMs
have a spiraling track much like a audio record. Having tracks and sectors
alone would not make the phase change drive special from optical disk but the
drive has some very special properties; The phase change drive allows for
direct overwrite of data which magneto optical can't do inexpensively and the
media has the very special property of NOT being susceptible to magnetic
fields or as sensitive to static discharge which gives the media a very long
shelf life.

<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>The LF1000 is SCSI-2 compatible device. It features a block size of 512 bytes
and is compatible with the Linux SCSI drivers. This drive was installed on a
PC compatible AMD 100MHZ 486 with an Adaptec 1542C SCSI bus-master
controller. To install and mount a disk the following steps were taken; 
<P>
<H3>Installation steps</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Install the drive and set the SCSI address to not interfere with other
SCSI devices. Re-connect all cabling. </LI>
<LI> Boot the computer. Your SCSI controller should note the new drive. </LI>
<LI> During the Linux kernel boot, you should see an additional SCSI
device. In my case, having a magnetic system disk for device /dev/sda
it shows up as /dev/sdb. </LI>
<LI> I did NOT partition the device because fdisk issued an overwrite
warning and I did not want to change anything from a dosemu
standpoint. </LI>
<LI> mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdb </LI>
<LI> mkdir /pd </LI>
<LI> mount -t ext2 -o ro,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async /dev/sdb /pd -
Read only </LI>
<LI> mount -t ext2 -o defaults /dev/sdb /pd - Mount drive W/R </LI>
</UL>
<P><EM>Your ready to "Rock'n'Roll"</EM>
<P>
<H3>Usage hints </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The media which comes with the drive is reported be re-writable about
500,000 times. This means that it is not advisable to install a live operating
system such as Linux on the phase change optical drive. These live operating
systems tend to cache processes to and from disk. Over time this can easily
approach the phase change media life. 
</LI>
<LI>Mount drive read only as much as possible. 
</LI>
<LI>When writing to the drive do so in large chunks. This will help 
reduce any file fragmentation which will require more read seeks. 

</LI>
<LI>This is however an excellent media for backups, gifs, mpeg or storing 
large programs which you don't use that often. The restore from backup is much
faster that tape. Backups can be performed using the cp -rp command without
the need for the ftape driver. This however, will replace symbolic links with
the actual file. </LI>
<LI>If while using the PD for writing, You find that the file you just
wrote to the disk are not there, chances are that the disk write
protect tab is in write protect mode and you mounted it in read/write mode.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Additional Configuration concerns by Jeff Rooze</A>
</H2>

<P>Hello,
<P>I read your article on configuring the Panasonic LF-1000 for
Linux. I have configured my system so that the optical drive
has its own device name and the CD-ROM has its own device name. 
This has allowed me to mount either media at any time. I do not
require any media in the drive when I boot Linux. Also I am using
the optical drive as an ext2 formatted media.
<P>I had a couple of minor difficulties in doing so.
<P>  
First, I had configured my hard drive at SCSI ID 6 and my PD
at SCSI ID 4. (I wanted to have the hard drive at a higher priority
that the PD). This caused a problem with the Linux SCSI driver. The
driver scans the SCSI devices from the Lower SCSI id's to the higher
(eg: 0 .. 6).  Consequently my logical device names were assigned 
differently depending on which type of media was installed in the
PD drive. This caused a big problem. My Linux partition is on my 
SCSI hard drive and the root device name would change! I corrected
this problem by modifying the software in the kernel SCSI driver to
scan the devices in reverse order. 
<P>Second, the distribution Linux kernel does not scan all SCSI LUNS.
The PD/CD drive has a mode that establishes the CD-ROM at LUN 1 and
the PD at LUN 0. This mode is selected by the configuration switches
on the PD/CD drive. Switch #2 should be down (off?). If this switch
is up (on?), the signature of the device is dependent upon the media
that is installed and it only reports this device on LUN 0. If no 
media is installed I think it defaults to CD-ROM.
I am using an Future Domain 16-xx SCSI interface card and the
software in Linux kernel driver supports an optical device signature
when scanning the LUNS. I assume that this is standard for most of 
the SCSI drivers. I reconfigured the kernel to enable the "scan all
LUNS" switch. The kernel then assigns different device names for each
device. The following is an excerpt from by boot log. You will note a
series of errors in this log. This is because I did not have the
optical media installed in the drive and the driver was attempting to
look at the partition table to determine the block size. Fortunately
it defaults to 512. I am planning on modifying the Future Domain SCSI
driver to not do this when it detects the optical device.

<P>Third, I modified my file system table (/etc/fstab) to list each
device but do not attempt to auto mount when booting. I have 
included an excerpt from my fstab. The most important options
are the noauto, rw(ro), and the checkpass flag.
<P>To create a ext2 file system on the PD, I used the command
"mkfs.ext2 -i 2048 /dev/sdb".

<P>
<P>After making these changes, I have had no problems with mounting
either media. All I need to do is to load the media and type
"mount /optd" or "mount /dist" and the system does all the rest.
<P>I hope this information is useful.

<P>
<P>I tried Jeff's suggestion. Here are the steps I performed;
<UL>
<LI>Modify my kernel using "make xconfig" in the /usr/src/linux directory 
and installed it. </LI>
<LI>Change the mode jumper on the PD drive to non-DOS mode. I soldered
a switch across the mode jumper connections and routed it the the
back panel. I figured out which switch position was the open position
and labeled this one for DOS.  The other position is of course Linux.
So before I boot my system I decide which OS I'll be using and set the
switch accordingly. History shows it staying in the Linux position
more and more.</LI>
<LI> Re-boot your system. You should now see multiple LUN show up 
during boot for the PD SCSI device number - It works great!!! If you have 
an older kernel modify the "/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/config.in" file.</LI>
<LI>Update the fstab for both CD and PD drives.</LI>
<LI>Use appropriate mount command.</LI>
<LI>"df" to make sure your ready.</LI>
</UL>
<P>I did try moving my primary SCSI drive to 6 but experienced some
difficulties. Can't remember exactly what it was but it may have
been that my controller "Adaptec 1542" with "Corel SCSI" requires a
bootable disk and SCSI 0 for the BIOS install to work properly with
DOS. So I switched it back and enjoyed playing with my properly
install PD drive! With this configuration "workman" - the audio
CD player util - works fine.
