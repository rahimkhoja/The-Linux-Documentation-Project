<P>Linux people have successfully used # 9 XGE Level 12, ELSA Winner 1000,
and S3-928 video cards. The XFree86(tm)-3.1.1 does support boards
with the tseng et4000/w32 in accelerated mode, as well as S3
Vision 864 and 964 chipsets including boards like the ELSA Winner
1000Pro and 2000Pro, Number Nine GXE64 and GXE64Pro, Miro Crystal
20SV). Support in the S3 Server for the Chrontel8391 clock chip has
been added. 
<P>Trio32 and Trio64 S3 Boards like the SPEA V7 Mirage P64 PCI and  MIRO
Crystal 40SV, are also supported, the Mach32 and Mach64 are supported
in accelerated mode, too. 
<P>The SVGA Driver 
<P>16bpp mode (65K colors instead of the usual 256) support for Mach32
boards as well as 32bpp for some S3 boards and the P9000 boards has
been added.

<P>tldraben@teleport.com reported:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Diamond Stealth W32 (et4000/W32) -- Text mode works, X11 suffered from 
"pixel dust", unbearable never got it to work and returned it.</LI>
<LI> # 9GXE L12 -- Works, virtual consoles corrupted when switched, fixed this with disabling the "fast dram mode" feature in his BIOS. Does not get a dot clock above 85, though.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Genoa Phantom 8900PCI card seems to work well.
Genoa Phantom/W32 2MB does not work in an ASUS-Board. 
Tseng 3000/W32i chipset seems to work well.
Spea-v7 mercury-lite works perfectly since XFree86(tm)-2.1.
<P>Spea V7 Mirage P64 PCI 2M with Trio64 works nice since
XFree86(tm)-3.1.1
<P>
<P>ATI Graphics Ultra Pro for PCI with 2MB VRAM and an ATI68875C DAC run
well as dem@skyline.dayton.oh.us tells us: "It's humming
right along at 1280x1024 w/256 colors @74Hz non-interlaced. Looks
great."
<P>Paradise WD90C33 PCI did lock up on screensaver/X - this has been
solved in the newer versions of the kernel.
jbauer@badlands.NoDak.edu (John Edward Bauer)   
<P>miroChrystal 8S/PCI (1MB) S3 - no problem.
<P>Stephen Tweedie reported his Cirrus Logics 5434 PCI card works well. 
It is a 64bit with 2M and runs perfectly with the SVGA driver in 8, 16 and
32 bit per pixel.
