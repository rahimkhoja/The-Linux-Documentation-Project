Although this falls somewhat outside the scope of this HOWTO
it cannot be denied that recently some rather large drives have
become very affordable. Drives with 10 - 20 GB are becoming
common and the question often is how best to partition such
monsters. Interestingly enough very few seem to have any problems
in filling up such drives and the future looks generally quite
rosy for manufacturers planning on even bigger drives.
<P>Opportunities for optimisations are of course even smaller
than for 2 drive systems but some tricks can still be used
to optimise track positions while minimising head movements.

<P>Remember that the <CODE>dosdata</CODE> partition is a DOS filesystem that
must be the very last partition on the drive, otherwise Windows
gets confused.
