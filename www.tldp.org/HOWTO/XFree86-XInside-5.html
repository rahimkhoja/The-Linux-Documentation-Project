<P>That's all folks ! I hope this will be useful to you. I don't think
I'll buy the XiGraphics server in the near future for one simple reason:
the release of XFree86 3.2 solved all of the text speed problems I was
having on my humble Trio 64 video board ;)
<P>It seems anyway that the XiGraphics server supports a much wider array
of chipsets and video boards than XFree, so it may well happen that the
commercial 'alternative' is the only viable one for you. If this is the
case, and you bought the XiGraphics server, I would really like to hear
from you to know if the information presented here has been useful to
you, or if you found it too complex or whatever.
<P>
