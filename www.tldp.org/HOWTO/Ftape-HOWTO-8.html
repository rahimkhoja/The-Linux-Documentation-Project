<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Creating an emergency boot floppy for <CODE>ftape</CODE></A></H2>

<H4>Comment</H4>
As of the time of this writing (August 1998) I remember that I have read
about several emergency disk sets in the <B>c.o.l.a</B>
(<CODE>comp.os.linux.announce</CODE>) news group since the time this section has
been written. Some of those packages actually might produce rather
sophisticated emergency boot floppy sets. Please check out yourself.  I
didn't try to create an emergency boot floppy with recent versions of
<CODE>ftape</CODE>.
<P>
<P>This section was written by Claus T&oslash;ndering
<CODE>&lt;ct@login.dknet.dk&gt;</CODE>.
<P>Once you are the happy owner of a tape drive and several tapes full of
backups, you will probably ask yourself this question: ``If everything
goes wrong, and I completely lose my hard disk, how do I restore my
files from tape?''
<P>What you need is an emergency floppy disk that contains enough files
to enable you to boot Linux and restore your hard disk from tape.
<P>The first thing you should do is to read ``The Linux Bootdisk HOWTO''
written by Graham Chapman 
<A HREF="mailto:grahamc@zeta.org.au">&lt;grahamc@zeta.org.au&gt;</A>.  That document tells you almost
everything you need to know about making an emergency floppy boot kit.
The paragraphs below contain a few extra pieces of information that
will make your life a bit easier when you follow Graham Chapman's
procedures:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>    You don't really need <CODE>/etc/init</CODE>, <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>, 
<CODE>/etc/getty</CODE>, and <CODE>/etc/rc.d/*</CODE> on your floppy disk.  If
Linux doesn't find <CODE>/etc/init</CODE>, it will start <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>
on your console, which is fine for restoring your system.  Deleting
these files gives you extra space on your floppy, which you will
probably need.</LI>
<LI>    Find a small version of <CODE>/bin/sh</CODE>.  They are frequently
available on the boot floppies that come with a Linux distribution.
This again will give you extra space.  I'd suggest <CODE>ash</CODE>, which
is extremely small (approx 62Kbytes), and yet very <CODE>bash</CODE>
compatible.</LI>
<LI>    The <CODE>/etc/fstab</CODE> you include on your floppy disk should look
something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        /dev/fd0        /               minix   defaults
        none            /proc           proc    defaults
        /dev/hda        /mnt            ext2    defaults
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once you have booted from your floppy, give the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mount -av
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>    Make sure your floppy drive is not mounted when you access the
streamer tape!  Otherwise you may get the following error message:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        Unable to grab IRQ6 for ftape driver
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This means that you <B>MUST</B> load the floppy into a RAMDISK.

This has the unfortunate consequence that the programs needed to
restore the files from the tape can not be located on a separate
floppy disk.  You have two options here:
<OL>
<LI>    You place <CODE>tar</CODE> (or <CODE>cpio</CODE> or <CODE>afio</CODE> or
whatever other backup program you use) on your root floppy
disk.  (This is where you'll need all the extra space created
in the steps above.) </LI>
<LI>    Before you start restoring from tape, copy <CODE>tar</CODE> (or
<CODE>cpio</CODE> or <CODE>afio</CODE> or whatever) to your hard disk
and load it from there.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>    Apart from your backup program, you will probably need <CODE>mt</CODE> on
your root floppy as well.</LI>
<LI>    Make sure your ftape device (typically <CODE>/dev/nqft0</CODE>) is present
on your boot floppy.</LI>
<LI>    Finally: <B>TRY IT OUT!</B> Of course, I don't recommend that you
destroy your hard disk contents to see if you are able to restore
everything.  What I do recommend, however, is that you try booting
from your emergency disks and make sure that you can at least make a
file listing of the contents of your backup tape.</LI>
