<H2><A NAME="s5">5. X Window FTP clients</A></H2>

<P>There are several graphical FTP clients designed to run on the X Window
system. These clients offer ease of use for users who are used to graphical
environments, and sometimes offer versatile options that would be hard to
implement in a text-based ftp client.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 gFTP</A>
</H2>

<P>gFTP is an FTP client for X Windows written using Gtk. The interface has
some similarities to the popular WS_FTP software commonly used on a certain
unstable operating system. 
<P>
<P>gFTP features simultaneous downloads, resuming of interrupted file transfers,
file transfer queues, downloading of entire directories, ftp proxy support,
remote directory caching, passive and non-passive file transfers,
drag-n-drop support, a very nice connection manager and more.
<P>
<P>If you are running Red Hat Linux and have the GNOME desktop installed, then
you probably already have gFTP. If not, you can download gFTP from its
homepage at 
<A HREF="http://gftp.seul.org/">http://gftp.seul.org/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 WXftp</A>
</H2>

<P>WXftp is an FTP client for the X Window System designed to be used mainly on
Linux workstations. It is written using the WXWindows toolkit, so it
can be compiled to use either Motif or GTK+
<P>
<P>It includes an intuitive user interface (much like WS_FTP), a session
manager, on-line help, a progress bar, and more
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 LLNL XDIR and XFTP</A>
</H2>

<P>LLNL XFTP was one of the first graphical FTP clients for Linux. It supports
FXP (file transfer between two remote hosts), and has a Motif based
interface.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 guiftp</A>
</H2>

<P>Guiftp is a simple ftp client written with the GTK+ toolkit. It's good if
you don't need many features and want a simple, clean look.
<P>
<P>Guiftp's homepage is at
