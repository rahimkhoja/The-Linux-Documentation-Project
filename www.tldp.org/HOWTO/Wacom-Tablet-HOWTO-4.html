The 
<A HREF="Wacom-Tablet-HOWTO-3.html#_gpm">gpm</A>
daemon supports allot of input devices, including tablets. If you want
a list of the supported devices of your gpm, do a
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>gpm -t help</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and you get it.
<P>The Wacom driver of gpm 1.18.0 and below seems to be for the very old
artpad models, the documentation does not say anything about this. I
tested it with ultrapad, penpartner, graphire and intuos models but it did not
work.  I have rewritten the wacom driver for gpm, to use it you need at least
gpm version 1.18.2 . Since 1.18.2, the old wacom driver has been replaced with
my driver for wacom graphire, penpartner and ultrapad products.
<P>However, if you own an old artpad, use gpm &lt; 1.18.1 and try:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>killall gpm ; gpm -t wacom -m /dev/ttyS0</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and it should work.
<P> 
If you own a graphire, use gpm > 1.18.1 instead and use
<P>for the relative (mouse-like) mode:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>killall gpm ; gpm -t wacom -o relative -m /dev/ttyS0</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

for the absolute (tablet-like) mode:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<EM>killall gpm ; gpm -t wacom -o absolute -m /dev/ttyS0</EM>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of course, you get only the buttons and the movement
function, pressure and tilt are not supported because they are not too useful
in text-based applications. <BR> 
There is no support for ultrapad macro buttons or graphire mouse wheel.
<P>If you use gpm and XFree86, you may or may not run in problems, because
normally a device can be opened only by one program at a time. There are two
solutions for that:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The gpm repeater mode. If you start gpm with the &quot;-R protocol&quot;
option, it will repeat all data it gets
to the device /dev/gpmdata. Let us say, you have a ps2 type mouse and your gpm
call looks like:
<EM>gpm -t ps2 -Rmman</EM>
then gpm gets your ps2 mouse data and tries to translate this into a mman
packet, which it will emit to /dev/gpmdata. Unfortunately, gpm can translate to
only a few protocols at the time of writing. Since gpm 1.18.1, these protocols to which can be translated are marked with an asterix at the first column.
Again, do a 
<EM>gpm -t help</EM> 
to get the list.<P>
<P>If you want to omit the translation and only get the data byte for
byte, just call
<EM>gpm -t ps2 -R raw</EM>
. You can then make XFree use that second device by putting the line
<EM>Device      "/dev/gpmdata"</EM>
in your XF86Config in the pointer section or the XInput section.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you use startx, you can modify it that it does a
<EM>gpm -k</EM>
before the X-Server is started. This option kills a running gpm.</LI>
</UL>
