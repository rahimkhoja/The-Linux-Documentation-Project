<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Note about authentication</A></H2>

<P>
<P>When you connect to an Internet Services Provider, it is usually
necesary that you send an username and a password. This can be
accomplished using several methods; the exact method that you use is
determined by your provider.
<P>Added to the three shown options, you can use a link without
authentication, (generally when the remote end is also yours).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Username and password - Login and password prompts.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Actually, this is not an usual authentication method to access the
Internet through an ISP.
<P>Identification is made before <CODE>pppd</CODE> is started, and it is the dialer,
usually <CODE>chat</CODE>, who sends the login name and the password. This
data is sent in plaintext, so this method should not be considered secure.
<P>An example script for <CODE>chat</CODE> where you can see how to specify username
and password to be sent before running <CODE>pppd</CODE> would look something like
this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ABORT BUSY
ABORT "NO CARRIER"
ABORT VOICE
ABORT "NO DIALTONE" 
ABORT "NO ANSWER"
"" ATZ
OK ATDT_TelephoneNumber_
CONNECT \d\c
ogin _Username_
assword _Password_
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The last 2 lines define username and password, and when to send it (after
receiving «ogin» and «assword» respectively.  The chat script only needs
to see parts of the words «login» and «password» and so we don't check the
first letter of each.  This is so that we don't need to worry about
uppercase/lowercase characters.
<P>Suppose that this script is called <CODE>provider</CODE>, and it is saved into
the <CODE>/etc/chatscripts</CODE> directory. Then, you can run it with:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/provider
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 PAP - Password Authentication Protocol</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If the provider you are using requires PAP as the authentication protocol,
during the LCP negotiation in PPP this protocol will be asked to use this
protocol. When the phone call is connected after using <CODE>chat</CODE>,
<CODE>pppd</CODE> is started. In this scenario, pppd will send the username and
the password, which it will look for in the <CODE>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</CODE>
file. This file must have read and write permissions only for <CODE>root</CODE>
only, so that nobody else can read the passwords inside it.
<P>PAP is not very secure, as the password is sent in plaintext, so can be
read by somebody that monitors your transmission line.
<P>Simple example of <CODE>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
_Username_ * _Password_

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 CHAP - Challenge Authentication Protocol</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If the provider you are using requires CHAP as the authentication protocol,
during the LCP negotiation in PPP this protocol will be asked to use this
protocol. When the phone call is connected after using <CODE>chat</CODE>,
<CODE>pppd</CODE> is started. In this scenario, pppd will send the username and
the password, which it will look for in the <CODE>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</CODE>
file. This file must have read and write permissions only for <CODE>root</CODE>
only, so that nobody else can read the passwords inside it.
<P>CHAP is more secure than PAP, as the password is never sent through the
transmission line in plaintext. The authentication server sends a random
identifier (the challenge), that the client must encrypt with its
password, and then send back to the server.
<P>Simple example of <CODE>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
_Username_ * _Password_
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sometimes an ISP uses PAP and other times CHAP, so it is common to define
your username and password in both files.
