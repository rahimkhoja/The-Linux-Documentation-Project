<P>2005-10-09</P>
<P><EM>Recently I had a hard-disk failure and my more_than_a_year old
Linux/Windows 2000 home system disappeared. When considering what to
have on a new purchased disk, I decided to try Linux with both Windows
2000 and Windows XP.</EM></P>

<P>In short, the new disk was of 40 GB and I made a half of it (20 GB)
a NTFS partition for Windows XP. It became so called C: disk. The
second partition of 10 GB (FAT32) became D: disk of Windows 2000. As
usual, you have to repeat installations of Microsoft products for
several times - before they even start behaving partly as you expect
from them. To be more precize, it looked that Windows 2000 had to be
installed <EM>before</EM> Windows XP, in order its boot entry got
a part of XP's list of boot entries (If I remember, I tried it the
opposite way and it didn't work).</P>

<P>Then I used the remaining 10 GB to install Mandrake 9.1 (Bamboo) and
I made it without problems - The only minor issue was that a try of
disk-type installation where Linux files were placed on an existing
NTFS partition failed because Linux setup actually did not manage to
locate installation files on a NTFS partition. (That was why I made
Windows 2000 installation on a FAT32 file system - because later I
could use it for Mandrake 9.1 disk-type setup).</P>

<P>So far - so good. One of the main things I wanted to make working
within all three environments was the e-mail client. You bet, an another
open source solution was available: the Mozilla suite. For Windows
operating systems I used Mozilla 1.7.11 and for Linux I used Mozilla
1.6 (an older xft version - some newer ones I was not able to install).
And, as usual for me, I wanted all of them to share my mailbox files,
i.e. I wanted to access my incoming emails from all and each operating
system - booted at the time.</P>

<P>In order to make that possible, I chose Mozilla under Windows 2000
(FAT32) to become the 'central location' for saving the mailbox files.
That means I had to make some changes within other two Mozilla's
configurations - to make them capable to read/write from/to the first
chosen mailbox location (FAT32). For Linux I did the following:</P>

<P>Instead of keeping an 'original' Linux-native location:
<PRE>
/home/misko/.mozilla/default/fydeba98.slt/Mail/solair.eunet.yu
</PRE>

I changed to this mounted one:
<PRE>
/mnt/win_d/Documents and Settings/misko/Application Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/oeu1tmbd.slt/Mail/solair.eunet.yu
</PRE>
</P>

<P>As a result of that change, now it is possible for me to download
email messages from within one O.S. - then to read them from another
O.S. - and finally reply/send the email from the 3rd one environment.
The only minor drawback is that each operating system is likely to
'remember' only its own last known state of Mozilla's Mail &amp; Newsgroups.
In order to get a 'refreshed' state of e-mail folders, a user has to
click on a mailbox name. Another solution is to activate an option of
'Compact all folders ...'.</P>

<P>What belongs to my 'wish-list' now, is to continue upgrading all
three Mozilla's (at least that old one v1.6 that runs under Mandrake).
It makes me wonder if I could use a 'regular' one (instead of xft's)
- although I remember that older regular's were producing awful fonts
under Linux environment. I am not sure if things got improved.</P>

<P>The second important task is to install one of the most popular radio
amateur software, also an open-source, called LinFBB (FBB for Linux).
More details related to that you can find in another Linux manual: the
