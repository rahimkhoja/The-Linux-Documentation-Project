>       If everything worked, you should now be able to reboot you're
       system, and start your freshly installed Linux system for the
       first time. Reinsert the boot floppy disk in the floppy drive,
       and switch the machine on again. If it won't boot, try to hit
       F5 at the splash screen while the system check icons pop up in
       the bottom of the screen.  At the boot prompt, ("Linux/PPC
       load:") you must add a boot parameter to make the system find
       your root partition.  (That's usually the main system
       partition.) Press backspace to remove what's already there, and
       add something like this:

       I use sda3 as sda3 is where I have installed my root partition, 
       that is, the partition mounted at "/". You might
       have something different, and you should have written it down
       when you partitioned you harddisk(s). Luckily we did this, of course.

       machine, until we make our own kernel that suits the
       installation we just finished. This is described in <A

	networking. This is done by editing the file
	/etc/networking/interfaces , but the syntax of that file is
	way out of scope for this document. More information should be

        really?" If the answer to that question is "No" then skip to

	want to (re)configure your network.  There does exist a tool
	called "drakconnect" that should be able to do this, but I
	never got it to behave. Configuring the local network is easy
	though. Just fire up your favourite editor (at least vi is
	installed) and edit the files mentioned below. This example
	describes a static ip configuration. Generally, this is the
	"RedHat" way to do things, so examples and documentation
	should be easy to find.  </P

>        I'm no Mandrake Guru. I actually never use Mandrake, and fixed
        the installer just for the exercise. By some reason, eth0
        doesn't get active at boot time with the configuration above,
        though it does after a 'ifdown eth0; ifup eth0', so I just
        put that in my rc.local. Go figure.

         even coffee. From here, you have to know how to use
