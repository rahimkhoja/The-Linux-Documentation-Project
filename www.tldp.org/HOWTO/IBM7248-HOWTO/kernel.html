><P
>        The kernel we have used this far is a complete 2.4 (2.2 for
        YellowDog) kernel that I have provided. This is a quite stable
        and good kernel, but it's not sure that it's what you
        want. You should make your own kernel so you know what patches
        you need and what modules you can install when you really need
        them. Here are links to all sources and patches, and a step by
        step guide to compile your new kernel.
      </P
><P
>        As for the installation we just have done, you have to boot
	from floppy. Would it not have been nice to be able to boot
	directly off the hard disk - and by the way, what about sound
	support? Let's set up this together as quickly as
	possible.
      </P

	gives us a working frame buffer console able to run XFree86.  This
	may sound complicated, but believe me, it's not. Follow the steps

>        First we must get the working 2.4 source. To get this, we'll
        use the rsync tool, so check that you have it installed. Some
        nice people have set up an rsync server of the BitKeeper
        Linux/PPC development tree at source.mvista.com. Thanks so
        very much to them, remember them in your heart and
        prayers.

>        Note: You may use the standard Linux kernel source from any
        ftp.kernel.org mirror. A modern kernel like 2.4.21 should work
        allright. I've found the devel tree more well functioning on
        the 7248, so I stick with it.

          on the 7248. Change the value of the root device to the
          device where your root (/) filesystem is mounted. This is
          done with <EM

        Now, go and make yourself a cup of tea or coffee or have a
        beer or a bible study for some minutes. This can take some
        time. If everything is alright, you'll finally have a kernel

        as 20 minutes, depending on your kernel configuration.

        Linux-based systems like, we keep kernels and their setupfiles
        in the /boot directory. Check what version you run with a look
        at the Makefile, and add proper version numbers in the

        Assuming that sda1 is your boot device with a PReP Boot
