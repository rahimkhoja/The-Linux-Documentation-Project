<P>
<P>This is the Linux VAR HOWTO.  It contains a listing of service companies
which do not manufacture hardware or create packaged software, but add
value to existing products.  This added value can take many forms, such as
installation of Linux on computer hardware, configuration, or custom
applications.  However, at the moment the Linux VAR HOWTO only
contains companies selling preconfigured hardware for the purpose of
running Linux.  Companies offering other services are invited to
contact the maintainer poet@linuxports.com at
<A HREF="mailto:poet@linuxports.com">poets@linuxports.com</A>
for a listing.
<P>
<P>If you contact any companies listed in this document, please mention the
Linux VAR HOWTO.
