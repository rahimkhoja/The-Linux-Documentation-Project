>6. Password Security and Encryption</H1
><P
>&#13;One of the most important security features used today are
passwords. It is important for both you and all your users to have
secure, unguessable passwords. Most of the more recent Linux
distributions include <TT
CLASS="literal"
>passwd</TT
> programs that do not allow you to set a
easily guessable password. Make sure your <TT
CLASS="literal"
>passwd</TT
> program is up to date
and has these features.
</P
><P
>&#13;In-depth discussion of encryption is beyond the scope of this
document, but an introduction is in order. Encryption is very useful,
possibly even necessary in this day and age. There are all sorts of
methods of encrypting data, each with its own set of
characteristics.
</P
><P
>&#13;Most Unicies (and Linux is no exception) primarily use a one-way
encryption algorithm, called DES (Data Encryption Standard) to encrypt
your passwords. This encrypted password is then stored in (typically)
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> (or less commonly) <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
>. When you attempt to login,
the password you type in is encrypted again and compared with the entry in
the file that stores your passwords. If they match, it must be the
same password, and you are allowed access. Although DES is a two-way
encryption algorithm (you can code and then decode a message, given
the right keys), the variant that most Unixes use is one-way. This
means that it should not be possible to reverse the encryption to get
the password from the contents of <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> (or <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
>).
</P
><P
>&#13;Brute force attacks, such as "Crack" or "John the Ripper" (see section <A
HREF="password-security.html#crack"
>Section 6.9</A
>) can often guess passwords unless your password is sufficiently
random. PAM modules (see below) allow you to use a different
encryption routine with your passwords (MD5 or the like).  You can use
Crack to your advantage, as well.  Consider periodically running Crack
against your own password database, to find insecure passwords.  Then
contact the offending user, and instruct him to change his password.

>6.1. PGP and Public-Key Cryptography</H2
><P
>&#13;Public-key cryptography, such as that used for PGP,
uses one key for encryption, and one key for
decryption.  Traditional cryptography, however, uses the same key
for encryption and decryption; this key must
be known to both parties, and thus somehow transferred from one to the other
securely.
</P
><P
>&#13;To alleviate the need to securely transmit the encryption
key, public-key encryption uses two separate keys: a public key
and a private key.  Each person's public key is available by anyone to
do the encryption, while at the same time each person keeps his or her
private key to decrypt messages encrypted with the correct public key.
</P
><P
>&#13;There are advantages to both public key and private key cryptography,
and you can read about those differences in <A
HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/"
TARGET="_top"
>the RSA Cryptography FAQ</A
>,
listed at the end of this section.
</P
><P
>&#13;PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is well-supported on Linux. Versions 2.6.2
and 5.0 are known to work well. For a good primer on PGP and how to
use it, take a look at the PGP FAQ: <A

>&#13;Be sure to use the version that is applicable to your country. Due
to export restrictions by the US Government, strong-encryption is
prohibited from being transferred in electronic form outside the
country.
</P
><P
>&#13;US export controls are now managed by EAR (Export Administration
Regulations).  They are no longer governed by ITAR.

>6.2. SSL, S-HTTP and S/MIME</H2
><P
>&#13;Often users ask about the differences between the various
security and encryption protocols, and how to use them.  While this
isn't an encryption document, it is a good idea to explain briefly
what each  protocol is, and where to find more information.

>&#13;<EM
>SSL:</EM
> - SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption
method developed by Netscape to provide security over the Internet.
It supports several different encryption protocols, and provides
client and server authentication.  SSL operates at the transport
layer, creates a secure encrypted channel of data, and thus can
seamlessly encrypt data of many types.  This is most commonly seen
when going to a secure site to view a secure online document with
Communicator, and serves as the basis for secure communications with
Communicator, as well as many other Netscape Communications data
encryption.  More information can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.consensus.com/security/ssl-talk-faq.html"
TARGET="_top"

Information on Netscape's other security implementations, and a good
starting point for these protocols is available at <A
HREF="http://home.netscape.com/info/security-doc.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://home.netscape.com/info/security-doc.html</A

worth noting that the SSL protocol can be used to pass many other
common protocols, "wrapping" them for security. See

>S-HTTP:</EM
> - S-HTTP is another protocol that provides
security services across the Internet.  It was designed to provide
confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiability [cannot be mistaken for someone else] while supporting multiple
key-management mechanisms and cryptographic algorithms via option 
negotiation between the parties involved in each transaction. S-HTTP
is limited to the specific software that is implementing it, and
encrypts each message individually. [ From RSA Cryptography FAQ,

Extension, is an encryption standard used to encrypt electronic mail
and other types of messages on the Internet.  It is an open standard
developed by RSA, so it is likely we will see it on Linux one day
soon.  More information on S/MIME can be found at <A

><P
>&#13;Along with CIPE, and other forms of data encryption, there are also 
several other implementations of IPSEC for Linux.  IPSEC is an effort
by the IETF to create cryptographically-secure communications at the
IP network level, and to provide authentication, integrity, access control,
and confidentiality.  Information on IPSEC and Internet draft can be
found at <A

also find links to other protocols involving key management, and an
IPSEC mailing list and archives.
</P
><P
>&#13;The x-kernel Linux implementation, which is being developed at the University
of Arizona, uses an object-based framework for implementing network
protocols called x-kernel, and can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/xkernel/hpcc-blue/linux.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cs.arizona.edu/xkernel/hpcc-blue/linux.html</A

simply, the x-kernel is a method of passing messages at the kernel
level, which makes for an easier implementation.
</P
><P
>&#13;Another freely-available IPSEC implementation is the Linux FreeS/WAN
IPSEC.  Their web page states,
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>""These services allow you to build 
secure tunnels through untrusted networks. Everything passing through 
the untrusted net is encrypted by the IPSEC gateway machine and
decrypted by the gateway at the other end. The result is Virtual

even though it includes machines at several different sites connected
by the insecure Internet.""</SPAN

>6.5. PAM - Pluggable Authentication Modules</H2
><P
>&#13;Newer versions of the Red Hat Linux and Debian Linux distributions ship with a unified
authentication scheme called "PAM". PAM allows you to change
your authentication methods and requirements on the
fly, and encapsulate all
local authentication methods without recompiling any of your
binaries.  Configuration of PAM is beyond the scope of this document,
but be sure to take a look at the PAM web site for more
information. <A

>&#13;Just a few of the things you can do with PAM:
</P
><P
>&#13;
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;Use encryption other than DES for your passwords. (Making them harder to
brute-force decode)
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Set resource limits on all your users so they can't perform
denial-of-service attacks (number of processes, amount of memory, etc) 
</P

>&#13;allow specific users to login only at specific times from specific
places
</P
></LI
></UL
>

</P
><P
>&#13;Within a few hours of installing and configuring your system, you can
prevent many attacks before they even occur.  For example, use PAM to
disable the system-wide usage of <TT

directories by adding these lines to <TT

Network.  Low-level encryption has the advantage that it can be made
to work transparently between the two networks connected in the VPN,
without any change to application software.

>&#13;Summarized from the CIPE documentation:
</P
><P
>&#13;<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"The IPSEC standards define a set of protocols which can be used (among 
other things) to build encrypted VPNs.  However, IPSEC is a rather
heavyweight and complicated protocol set with a lot of options,
implementations of the full protocol set are still rarely used and
some issues (such as key management) are still not fully resolved.
CIPE uses a simpler approach, in which many things which can be
parameterized (such as the choice of the actual encryption algorithm
used) are an install-time fixed choice.  This limits flexibility, but
allows for a simple (and therefore efficient, easy to debug...)
implementation."</SPAN

>6.8. Shadow Passwords.</H2
><P
>&#13;Shadow passwords are a means of keeping your encrypted password
information secret from normal users. Recent versions of both Red Hat
and Debian Linux use shadow passwords by default, but on other
systems, encrypted passwords 
are stored in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> file for all to read. Anyone can then run
password-guesser programs on them and attempt to determine what they are.
Shadow passwords, by contrast, are saved in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/shadow</TT
>, which
only privileged users can read. In order to use shadow passwords, you
need to make sure all your utilities that need access to password
information are recompiled to support them. PAM (above) also allows you
to just plug in a shadow module; it doesn't require re-compilation of
executables.  You can refer to the Shadow-Password HOWTO for further
information if necessary.  It is available at <A

>&#13;It's important for you to secure your graphical display to prevent
attackers from grabbing your passwords as you type
them, reading documents or information you are
reading on your screen, or even using a hole to gain root
access. Running remote X applications over a network also can be
fraught with peril, allowing sniffers to see all your interaction with 
the remote system. 
</P
><P
>&#13;X has a number of access-control mechanisms. The simplest of them is
host-based: you use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xhost</TT
> to specify the hosts that are allowed access
to your display. This is not very secure at all, because if someone has access
to your machine, they can <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xhost + their machine</TT
> and get in
easily. Also, if you have to allow access from an untrusted machine,
anyone there can compromise your display. 
</P
><P
>&#13;When using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xdm</TT
> (X Display Manager) to log in, you get a much better
access method: MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1. A 128-bit "cookie" is generated and
stored in your <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.Xauthority</TT
> file. If you need to allow a remote machine
access to your display, you can use the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xauth</TT
> command and the
information in your <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.Xauthority</TT
> file to provide access to only that connection.

>&#13;You can also use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ssh</TT
> (see <A
HREF="password-security.html#ssh"
>Section 6.4</A
>, above) to allow secure X
connections. This has the advantage of also being transparent to the
end user, and means that no unencrypted data flows across the
network. 
</P
><P
>&#13;You can also disable any remote connections to your X server by using
the '-nolisten tcp' options to your X server. This will prevent any
network connections to your server over tcp sockets. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Take a look at the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Xsecurity</TT
> man page for more information on X
security. The safe bet is to use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xdm</TT
> to login to your console and then
use <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ssh</TT
> to go to remote sites on which you wish to run X programs.

>&#13;SVGAlib programs are typically SUID-root in order to access all your
Linux machine's video hardware. This makes them very dangerous. If they
crash, you typically need to reboot your machine to get a usable
console back. Make sure any SVGA programs you are running are
authentic, and can at least be somewhat trusted. Even better, don't
run them at all.

video interfaces on Linux. GGI will move a small piece of the video
code into the Linux kernel, and then control access to the video
system. This means GGI will be able to restore your console at any
time to a known good state. They will also allow a secure attention
