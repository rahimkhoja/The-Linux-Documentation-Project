><P
>&#13;The next thing to take a look at is the security in your system
against attacks from local users. Did we just say <EM
>local</EM
> users? Yes!
</P
><P
>&#13;Getting access to a local user account is one of the first things that system
intruders attempt while on their way to exploiting the root
account. With lax local security, they can then "upgrade" their normal
user access to root access using a variety of bugs and poorly setup
local services. If you make sure your local security is tight, then
the intruder will have another hurdle to jump.
</P
><P
>&#13;Local users can also cause a lot of havoc with your system even
(especially) if they really are who they say they are. Providing
accounts to people you don't know or for whom you have no contact information
is a very bad idea.

>4.1. Creating New Accounts</H2
><P
>&#13;You should make sure you provide user accounts with only the minimal
requirements for the task they need to do. If you provide your son
(age 10) with an account, you might want him to only have access to a
word processor or drawing program, but be unable to delete data that
is not his.

access to your Linux machine:

<P

><LI
><P
>&#13;Give them the minimal amount of privileges they need.
</P

><LI
><P
>&#13;Be aware when/where they login from, or should be logging in from. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Make sure you remove inactive accounts, which you can determine by
using the 'last' command and/or checking log files for any activity by
the user. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;The use of the same userid on all computers and networks is advisable 
to ease account maintenance, and permits easier analysis of log
data.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;The creation of group user-id's should be absolutely prohibited.  User
accounts also provide accountability, and this is not possible with
group accounts.

</P
><P
>&#13;Many local user accounts that are used in security compromises have
not been used in months or years. Since no one is using
them they, provide the ideal attack vehicle.

>4.2. Root Security</H2
><P
>&#13;The most sought-after account on your machine is the root (superuser)
account.  This account has authority over the entire machine, which
may also include authority over other machines on the network.
Remember that you should only use the root account for very short,
specific tasks, and should mostly run as a normal user. Even small
mistakes made while logged in as the root user can cause problems. The 
less time you are on with root privileges, the safer you will be. 
</P
><P
>&#13;Several tricks to avoid messing up your own box as root:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;When doing some complex command, try running it first in a
non-destructive way...especially commands that use globing: e.g., if
you want to do <TT
CLASS="literal"
>rm foo*.bak</TT
>, first do <TT
CLASS="literal"
>ls foo*.bak</TT
> and make
sure you are going to delete the files you think you are. Using <TT
CLASS="literal"
>echo</TT
>
in place of destructive commands also sometimes works. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Provide your users with a default alias to the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>rm</TT
> command to ask for
confirmation for deletion of files.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13; 
Only become root to do single specific tasks. If you find yourself
trying to figure out how to do something, go back to a normal user
shell until you are <EM
>sure</EM
> what needs to be done by root. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;The command path for the root user is very important.  The command
path (that is, the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>PATH</TT
> environment variable) specifies the
directories in which the shell searches for programs.  Try to limit
the command path for the root user as much as possible, and <EM
>never</EM
>
include <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.</TT
> (which means "the current directory") in your PATH.
Additionally, never have writable directories in your search path, as
this can allow attackers to modify or place new binaries in your
search path, allowing them to run as root the next time you run that
command.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Never use the rlogin/rsh/rexec suite of tools (called the r-utilities)
as root. They are subject to many sorts of attacks, and are downright
dangerous when run as root. Never create a <TT
CLASS="literal"
>.rhosts</TT
> file for root.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;The <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/securetty</TT
> file contains a list of terminals that root can
login from. By default (on Red Hat Linux) this is set to only the local
virtual consoles(vtys). Be very wary of adding anything else to
this file. You should be able to login remotely as your regular user
account and then <TT
CLASS="literal"
>su</TT
> if you need to (hopefully over 
<A
HREF="password-security.html#ssh"
>Section 6.4</A
> or other encrypted channel), so there is no
need to be able to login directly as root. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Always be slow and deliberate running as root. Your actions could
affect a lot of things. Think before you type!
</P
></LI
></UL
>

</P
><P
>&#13;If you absolutely positively need to allow someone (hopefully very
trusted) to have root access to your machine, there are a few
tools that can help. <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sudo</TT
> allows users to use their password to access
a limited set of commands as root. This would allow you to, for
instance, let a user be able to eject and mount removable media on
your Linux box, but have no other root privileges. <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sudo</TT
> also keeps a
log of all successful and unsuccessful sudo attempts, allowing you to
track down who used what command to do what. For this reason <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sudo</TT
>
works well even in places where a number of people have root access,
because it helps you keep track of changes made.
</P
><P
>&#13;Although <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sudo</TT
> can be used to give specific users specific privileges
for specific tasks, it does have several shortcomings. It should be
used only for a limited set of tasks, like restarting a server, or
adding new users.  Any program that offers a shell escape will give
root access to a user invoking it via <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sudo</TT
>.  This includes
most editors, for example.  Also, a program as innocuous as
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/bin/cat</TT
> can be used to overwrite files, which could allow
root to be exploited.  Consider <TT
CLASS="literal"
>sudo</TT
> as a means for
accountability, and don't expect it to replace the root user and still
be secure.
