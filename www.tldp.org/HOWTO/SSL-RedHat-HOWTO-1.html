<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Purpose/Scope of this Guide</A></H2>

<P>The purpose of this guide is to assist RedHat Linux users with the
installation of server (SSL) certificates using the Apache web server.  The
goal is to provide a clear procedure that will save time and, in many cases,
money!
<P>
<P>First, I will cover what you need to know about the SSL protocol and
digital certificates.  In my experience, building an Apache web server with
ModSSL and OpenSSL is the most beneficial software combination.  OpenSSL is
a general-purpose cryptography library that supports the SSL v2/v3 and TLS
v1 protocols.  ModSSL is an Apache API module designed to act as an
interface between Apache and OpenSSL.  The biggest advantage is that all
three packages are free.
<P>
<P>Then, beginning with Section 4, I will go through the step-by-step
procedures for generating keys and installing certificates on a
RedHat-Apache server compiled with ModSSL and OpenSSL.  The procedures in
Section 4 will also work with commercial SSL-server packages such as
Stronghold and Raven that are closely related to Apache.
<P>
<P>Disclaimer:  I am a technical support engineer for Equifax Secure Inc., a
Certificate Authority.  Therefore, I use Equifax Secure certificates and
examples geared towards installing Equifax Secure certificates.  However,
the instructions will also work with certificates issued by other
Certificate Authorities.  Since this document was written at my own
initiative, Equifax Secure Inc. is neither liable nor accountable for any
consequences resulting from the use of these procedures.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 About Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</A>
</H2>

<P>SSL is a presentation layer service, located between the TCP and the
application layer.  It is platform and application independent.  SSL is
responsible for the management of a secure communications channel between
the client and server.  SSL provides a strong mechanism for encrypting data
transferred between a client and a server.
