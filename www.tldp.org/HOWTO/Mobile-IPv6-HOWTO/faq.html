      mipdiag, can make modifications to the kernel parameters using
      ioctl calls through the device file. <B

      handles the MIPv6 signaling and controls the operation of the
      kernel part. The userspace part is also progressing
      nicely. However, the protocol logic is still missing, so there
      isn't really anything for users to test yet. We should have a
      well working and tested prototype ready and by the end of
      March."</SPAN

>Q: Does MIPL support
      IPSec?</EM
></P
><P
>A: There is no support IPSec on 2.4.x. MIPL for 2.6 series will
      have IPSec support from the start. You may use a third-party IPSec
      implementation.</P

      direct communication using binding update/acks)?</EM

>Q: Can different wireless networks
     have different ESSIDs/WEP keys?</EM
></P
><P
>A: Yes, but you must change this upon arrival to the new
     network. MIPv6 from MIPL can't do this automatically.</P

>Q: If MN has travelled through several visited
     LAN, and then returning home; the interface still has all the
     autogenerated IPv6 addresses from all the visited networks! Is
     there any way to <SPAN

>"flush/delete"</SPAN

     addresses?</EM
></P
><P
>A: No, I do not know of any automatic way these adresses
     can be removed, but you can delete them manually:</P

      (subnets) are!</EM
></P
><P
>A: The host B doesn't know where host A is (B doesn't
      know where A's net is), so you must add a route

>&#13;     # route -A inet6 add default gw &#60;ipv6-host&#62;

><P
><EM
>Q: Why does the host send a multicast
     address rather than an anycast address, requesting for router
     solicitation?</EM
></P
><P
>A: Because the host wants an answer from every router, not from just any 
     router.  The idea is to be able to get all parameters and to choose
     the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"best"</SPAN
> default router.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Q: Why doesn't MN notice that it has
     moved?</EM
></P
><P
>A: It thinks that it's previous router is still reachable. This may
     result from very large lifetimes in router advertisements. Check the
     configuration of the program sending router advertisements in the
     router. If the program supports router advertisement intervals, you
     can use this to help MN in movement detection by setting the use of
     interval to <TT
CLASS="option"
>on</TT
>. See <B
CLASS="command"
>man radvd.conf</B
> for 
     details.</P
