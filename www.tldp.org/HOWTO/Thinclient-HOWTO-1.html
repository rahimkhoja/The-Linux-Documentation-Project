<LI>Linux allows any reasonably new computer to be used as a server to a
thin client, or many thin clients, these thin clients can be inexpensive
legacy computers. For a console terminal you need a 386 with 4-8mb of ram, or
for an X-Terminal a 486/66 with 8-16mb ram.
</LI>
<LI>One Option is without a hard drive, it keeps the noise down and
simplifies administration as you only have one system to maintain.
</LI>
<LI>If you have legacy apps, you can have them on a hard drive with it's
legacy Operating System
</LI>
<LI>This howto is aimed at those new to Unix/Linux, it will cover the
essential areas you need to be aware of and point you to other documentation
in that area you need to be familiar with.
</LI>
<LI>You will probably use this as an aid to the
<A HREF="http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/">http://www.slug.org.au/etherboot/</A>  documentation, I include some more
examples of config files, and leave many of the other features of etherboot as
an exercise for the reader
</LI>
<LI>If your client is sufficiently powerful only the file system need be
shared, applications can run on the client system. (say a 233 32mb ram).
Install an application on the server and all clients have access
