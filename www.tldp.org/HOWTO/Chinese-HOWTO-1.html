<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P><B>NOTE: I write the document to help novices. However, if it didn't, that's 
<EM>your</EM> problem, not <EM>mime</EM>! Don't complain that I WASTE your time,
because nobody has to answer your questions, and nobody has to write documents
to help you! You have been warned.</B>
<P>This is a document, as a part of 
<A HREF="Chinese-HOWTO-10.html#CLDP">Chinese Linux Documentation Projects</A>, introduces the progress in fulfilling Chinese on Linux.
The special point different from the other CLDP documents is that this HOWTO document, in turn, will be the first one and also <EM>the only</EM> one written in Chinese first and then translated into English later.^_^
<P>I have been made my best effort to ensure the exactness of this document, though; however, I couldn't give a guarantee for myself that all the operations and configurations can execute exactly and smoothly on your system. If any problems or losses have happened to your own system because of the executable examples issued in this document, which you have been followed, the authors, us, <EM>won't</EM> be in charge of any responsibility.
<P>The basic purpose carried with this document is to enormously reduce the questions repeated again and again, just like "Why can't I input/see Chinese?", "Why can't I set xxx up?" and so forth, occurred on Internet.
In fact, it is impossible as I knew it...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Awareness</A>
</H2>

<P>The shell program used in this document will be sh/bash. If other system(such as csh/tcsh) is your choice, you need to pay attention to the differences amongst them. On the configuration of environment variables, for instance, usage for sh/bash will be,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# export TERM=vt100
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>whereas for csh/tcsh ,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# setenv TERM vt100
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 Words from The Translator--Frank J.S. Chen</A>
</H2>

<P>This work begins on 1/8/98 and ends on 1/11/98, which I call the version of 0.1, as I always did for the initial states of anything. I appreciate the hard work of Chinese version  for its delicate statements and not leaving out any detail in the field of Chinese practices. The more I translated, the more I learned.
After examining all the sentences I've made, there are definitely many of them won't like real American-English, or the so called Chinese-styled English. Well, if you are skilled in this field of translation or are interested in the circle of computers science, anything about this English article, just like grammar, writing, internationalization of locale with Linux, translation, programming with C/C++, and so forth, will be sincerely grateful and excessively welcome, too.(1/11/98, modified on 6/2/98)
This is the secondary modification of it, focusing on the falses of typing, incorrect grammar, and correcting the meanings of ambiguous words(maybe a little research on sematics, just for this document:-)). I have no ideal about the translating quality of this paper, if you feel something strange or ill while reading, please let me know about it in my real heart. Pointing out the bad parts will be marvelous in spreading out this howto. 
As far as I know, English version of it had been translated into several foreign languages including Japanese, Swedish, etc. If you want to do another one, just go ahead, but we suggest you to inform anyone of us about that.(6/2/98)
