<P>Many people use both Linux and MS-Windows.  The ability to do so is an
important part of "the Linux revolution"; i.e. letting people
experiment with (and get hooked on) Linux while still being able to
run their off-the-shelf software.  Since both Linux and MS-Windows use
virtual memory with swap to disk, a frequently occurring question in
comp.os.linux.setup is how to share swap spaces, in order to reduce the
amount of disk space needed.
<P>There are several methods for sharing swap spaces, the one described
in this document is probably the most complicated one but is the only
one I have encountered that allows maximum performance for both
environments without the risk of trashing a disk partition. If you are
using DOS, then many DOS applications manage their own swap files. You
can also share the Linux swap partition with these applications.
