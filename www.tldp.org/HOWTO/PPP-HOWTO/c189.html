This contains a great deal of useful information in question/answer
format that is very useful when working out why PPP is not working
(properly).</P

><P
>The growing number of Linux books from various publishing houses and
authors;

You are actively encouraged to check the currency of these
books. Linux development and distributions tend to evolve fairly
rapidly, whilst the revision of books move (generally) much more slowly!
Buying an excellent book (and there are many) that is now out of date
will cause new users considerable confusion and frustration.</P

><P
>The documentation associated with the PPP tool(s) you are using

The package specific documentation, usually easily available, is
often the most useful when dealing with a specific tool.</P

>The best general starting point for Linux documentation is <A
HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org"

>The Linux Documentation Project Home Page</A

><P
>Whilst you can use this document to create your PPP link without reading
any of these documents, you will have a far better understanding of what
is going on if you do so! You will also be able to address problems
yourself (or at least ask more intelligent questions on the
comp.os.linux... newsgroups or Linux mailing lists).</P
><P
>These documents (as well as various others, including the relevant RFCs)
provide additional and more detailed explanation than is possible in
this HOWTO.</P
><P
>If you are connecting a LAN to the Internet using PPP, you will need
to know a reasonable amount about TCP/IP networking. In addition to the
documents above, you will find the O'Reilly books "TCP/IP Network Administration"
 and "Building Internet Firewalls" of considerable benefit!</P

>There are many Linux mailing lists that operate as a means of communication
between users of many levels of ability. By all means subscribe to those
that interest you and contribute your expertise and views.</P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>A word to the wise</I
>: some lists are specifically aimed at "high powered"
users and/or specific topics. Whilst no-one will complain if you 'lurk'
(subscribe but don't post messages), you are likely to earn heated
comments (if not outright flames) if you post 'newbie' questions to
inappropriate lists.</P
><P
>This is not because guru level users hate new users, but because these
lists are there to handle the specific issues at particular levels of
difficulty.</P
><P
>By all means join the lists that offer open subscription, but keep your
comments relevant to the subject of the list!</P
