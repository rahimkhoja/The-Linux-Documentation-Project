share IRQ3.</P

>If you have devices on standard serial ports that share an IRQ with your
modem you are going to have problems. You need to make sure that your
modem serial port is on its own, unique IRQ. Many modern serial cards
(and better quality motherboard serial ports) allow you to move the IRQ
of the serial ports around.</P

on IRQ15 (the permanent modem based PPP link to the Internet. (There is
also a serial port on com2, IRQ3 and com4 is on IRQ14, but as they are
not in use, they do not show up).</P
><P
>Be warned - you need to know what you are doing if you are going to play
with your IRQs! Not only do you have to open up you computer, pull out
cards and play with jumpers, but you need to know what is on which IRQ.
In my case, this is a totally SCSI based PC, and so I can disable the "on
motherboard" IDE interfaces that normally use IRQ14 and 15!</P
><P
>You should also remember that if your PC boots other operating systems,
moving IRQs around may well mean that OS cannot boot properly - or at all!</P
><P
>If you do move your serial ports to non-standard IRQs, then you need to
tell Linux which IRQ each port is using. This is done using "
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>setserial</TT
>" and is best done as part of the boot process in
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc.local</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc.serial</TT
> which is called from <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rc.local</TT
> or as
part of the SysV initialization. For the machine illustrated above, the
commands used are...

><P
>However, if you are using serial modules dynamically loaded, when
required by the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kerneld</TT
> process, you cannot set and forget the IRQs,
(etc.) once at boot time. This is because if the serial module is unloaded,
Linux forgets the special settings.</P
><P
>So, if you are loading the serial module on demand, you will need to
reconfigure the IRQs, (etc.) each time the module is loaded.</P

><P
>If you are using a high speed (external) modem (14,400 Baud or above),
your serial port needs to be capable of handling the throughput that
such a modem is capable of producing, particularly when the modems are
compressing the data.</P
><P
>This requires your serial port to use a modern UART (Universal
Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) such as a 16550(A). If you are using
an old machine (or old serial card), it is quite possible that your
serial port has only an 8250 UART, which will cause you considerable
problems when used with a high speed modem.</P

>to get Linux to report to you the type of UART you have. If you
do not have a 16550A type UART, invest in a new serial card (available
for under $50). When you purchase a new card, make sure you can
move the IRQs around on it!</P
><P
>Note: the first versions of the 16550 UART chip had an error. This was
rapidly discovered and a revision of the chip was released - the 16550A
UART. A relatively small number of the faulty chips did however get into
circulation. It is unlikely that you will encounter one of these but you
should look for a response that says 16550A, particularly on serial
cards of some vintage.</P
