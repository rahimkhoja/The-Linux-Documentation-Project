>PPP (the Point to Point Protocol) is a mechanism for creating and
running IP  (the Internet Protocol) and other network protocols over a
serial link - be that a direct serial connection (using a null-modem
cable), over a telnet established link, or a link made using modems and
telephone lines (and of course using digital lines such as ISDN).</P
><P
>Using PPP, you can connect your Linux PC to a PPP server and access the
resources of the network to which the server is connected (almost) as if
you were directly connected to that network.</P
><P
>You can also set up your Linux PC as a PPP server, so that other
computers can dial into your computer and access the resources on your
local PC and/or network.</P
><P
>As PPP is a peer-to-peer system, you can also use PPP on two Linux PCs
to link together two networks (or a local network to the Internet),
creating a Wide Area Network (WAN).</P
><P
>One major difference between serial based PPP and an Ethernet connection is of course
speed - a standard Ethernet connection operates at 10 Mbs (Mega - million bits
per second) or 100 Mbs maximum theoretical throughput, whereas an analogue modem
operates at speeds up to 56 kbps (kilo - thousand bits per second).</P
><P
>Also, depending on the type of PPP connection, there may be some
limitations in usage of some applications and services.</P

>PPP is strictly a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>peer to peer</I
> protocol; there is (technically) no
difference between the machine that dials in and the machine that is
dialed into. However, for clarity's sake, it is useful to think in terms
of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>servers</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>clients</I
>.</P
><P
>When you dial into a site to establish a PPP connection, you are a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>client</I
>. The machine to which you connect is the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>server</I
>.</P
><P
>When you are setting up a Linux box to receive and handle dial-in PPP
connections, you are setting up a PPP <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>server</I
>.</P
><P
>Any Linux PC can be both a PPP server and client - even
simultaneously if you have more than one serial port (and modem if
necessary). As stated above, there is no real difference between clients
and servers as far as PPP is concerned, once the connection is made.</P
><P
>This document refers to the machine that initiates the call (that dials
in) as the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>CLIENT</I
>, whilst the machine that answers the telephone,
checks the authentication of the dial in request (using user names,
passwords and possibly other mechanisms) is referred to as the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>SERVER</I
>.</P
><P
>The use of PPP as a client to link one or more machines at a location
into the Internet is, probably, the one in which  most people are
interested - that is using their Linux PC as a client.</P
><P
>The procedure described in this document will allow you to
establish and automate your Internet connection.</P
><P
>This document will also give you guidance in setting up your Linux PC as
a PPP <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>server</I
> and in linking two LANs together (with full routing)
using PPP (this is frequently characterized as establishing a WAN - wide
area network - link).</P
