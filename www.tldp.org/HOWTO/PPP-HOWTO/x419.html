>There are variations on this too - such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>serial line looped back</TT
>
etc., and the cause can be one (or a sequence) of a number of things.</P
><P
>To understand what is going on here, it is necessary to grasp a bit of
what is going on behind the scenes in pppd itself.</P
><P
>When pppd starts up, it sends LCP (link control protocol) packets to the
remote machine. If it receives a valid response it then goes on to the
next stage (using IPCP - IP control protocol packets) and only when
this negotiation completes is the actual IP layer started so that you
can use the PPP link.</P
><P
>If there is no ppp server operating at the remote end when your PC sends
lcp packets, these get reflected by the login process at the far end. As
these packets use 8 bits, reflecting them strips the 8th bit (remember,
ASCII is a 7 bit code). PPP sees this and complains accordingly.</P
><P
>There are several reasons this reflection can occur.</P

>When your chat script completes, pppd starts on your PC. However, if you
have not completed the log in process to the server (including sending
any command required to start PPP  on the server), PPP will not start.</P

>So, the lcp packets are reflected and you receive this error.</P

>Some PPP servers require you to enter a command and/or a RETURN after
completing the log in process before the remote end starts ppp.</P
><P
>Check your chat script (see above).</P
><P
>If you log in manually and find you need to send a RETURN after this to
start PPP, simply add a blank expect/send pair to the end of your chat
script (an empty send string actually sends a RETURN).</P

>8.3.3. The remote PPP process is slow to start</A
></H2
><P
>This one is a bit tricksy!</P
><P
>By default, your Linux pppd is compiled to send a maximum of 10 lcp
configuration requests. If the server is a bit slow to start up, all 10
such requests can be sent before the remote PPP is ready to receive
them.</P
><P
>On your machine, pppd sees all 10 requests reflected back (with the 8th
bit stripped) and exits.</P
><P
>There are two ways round this:-</P
><P
>Add "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>lcp-max-configure 30</TT
>" to your ppp options. This increases
the maximum number of lcp configure packets pppd sends before giving up.
For really slow server, you may need even more than this.</P
><P
>Alternatively, you can get a bit tricksy in return. You may have noticed
that when you logged in by hand to the PPP server and PPP started there,
the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>first</I
> character of the ppp garbage that appears was always the
tilde character (&#732;).</P
><P
>Using this knowledge we can add a new <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>expect/send</TT
> pair to the
end of the chat script which expects a tilde and sends nothing. This
would look like:-</P
