I frequently use a Search Engine to retrieve helpful or necessary 
information from the 'net. These engines catalogue pages from 
commercial, personal and academic websites, as well as Mailing Lists and 
the like.

There are several good search engine. It is worthwhile becoming very 
familiar with the operational details of at least one non-directory 
engine to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of your search efforts. 
You probably already have a favorite - I like 
<EM
>Google.com</EM
>, and will discuss it in a little more 
detail.

The key to a successful search is to use a good set of keywords. If 
you're getting a specific error message, you might search for its text. 
Otherwise, you need to find a few relevant words describing your 
problem. Then, by trial and error, you should be able to find some 
pertinent information.

This <A

TARGET="_top"
>engine</A
> has several novel 
features that are described in its <A
HREF="http://www.google.com/technology/"
TARGET="_top"
>Google Technology page</A
>. 
In particular, the engine often returns the most useful pages first; in 
fact, I have often found that the first listed page contains the 
information I need. Because it caches web pages, it is relatively fast 
at displaying requested items. It has a so-called 
<SPAN
CLASS="trademark"
>GoogleScout</SPAN
>&#8482; feature, activated by clicking on the 
"similar pages" links, that provides additional relevant links with each 
item returned.
