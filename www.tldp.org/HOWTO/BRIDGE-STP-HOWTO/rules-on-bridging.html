>If you ever tried to ping an unmanaged switch, you will know that
    it doesn't work, because you don't have a IP-address for it.
    To switch datagrams it doesn't need one.
    The other thing is if you want to manage the switch.
    It's too much strain, to take a dumb terminal, walk to the
    place you installed it (normally a dark, dusty and warm
    room, with a lot of green and red Christmas lights), to connect the
    terminal and to change the settings.
  </P
><P
>What you want is remote management, usually by SNMP, telnet, rlogin
    or (best) ssh.
    For all this services you will need a IP.
    That's the exception to the transparency.
    The new code allows you without any problem to assign a IP address to
    the virtual interface formed by the bridge-instance you will create
    in <A
HREF="set-up-the-bridge.html#BASIC-SETUP"
>Section 6.2</A
>.
    All NIC's (or other interfaces) in your bridge will happily listen and
    respond to datagrams destined to this IP.
  </P
><P
>All other data will not interfere with the bridge.
    The bridge just acts like a switch.
