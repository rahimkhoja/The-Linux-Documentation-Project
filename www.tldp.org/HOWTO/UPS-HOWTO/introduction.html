>1.1. Why this document?</H2
><P
>An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is an important thing to
have if you live in an area where power outages are at all common,
especially if you run a mail/DNS/Web server that must be up 24/7.  The
aging power grid in the U.S. has made this a more urgent issue than it
used to be even for American hackers, but everyone is vulnerable to
outages caused by storms and other natural phenomena.  This document
covers both the software and hardware aspects of protecting
yourself.</P
><P
>The advice in this document is aimed primarily at small
installations &#8212; one computer and one UPS.  Thus we'll focus on
consumer-grade UPSes, especially those designed for home and
small-business use.  If you are a data center administrator running a
big server farm, there is a whole different (and much more expensive)
range of technologies we'll do no more than hint at here.</P
