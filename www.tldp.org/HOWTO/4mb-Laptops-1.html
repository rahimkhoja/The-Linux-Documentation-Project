<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why this document was written.</A>
 </H2>

<P>I got my hands on two elderly laptops, both with just 4mb RAM and small
(&lt;=200mb) hard drives. I wanted to install Linux on them. The documentation
for this kind of laptop all recommends installing either a mini-Linux or an
old (and therefor compact) version of one of the professional distributions.
I wanted to install an up-to-date professional distribution.
<H2><A NAME="sec:whatuse"></A> <A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What use is a small laptop?</A>
 </H2>

<P>Plenty. It isn't going to run X or be a development box (see 
<A HREF="4mb-Laptops-3.html#sec:whichcomponents">Which components to install?</A>) but if you
are happy at the console you have a machine that can do e-mail, networking,
writing etc. Laptops also make excellent diagnostic/repair tools and the utilities
for that will easily fit onto small laptops. 
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Why not just upgrade the laptop?</A>
 </H2>

<P>Upgrading old laptops is not much cheaper than upgrading new ones. That's
a lot to spend on an old machine, especially considering that the manufacturer
isn't supporting it any more and spare parts are hard to find.
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What about 4mb desktop machines?</A>
 </H2>

<P>The procedure described in this document will work perfectly well on a
desktop PC. On the other hand, upgrading a desktop machine is far easier and
cheaper than upgrading a laptop. Even if you don't upgrade it, there are still
simpler options. You could take out the hard disk, put it in a more powerful
machine, install Linux, trim it to fit and then put the disk back in the old
machine. 
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What this document doesn't do.</A>
 </H2>

<P>This document is not a general HOWTO about installing Linux on laptops
or even a specific HOWTO for either of the two machines mentioned here. It
simply describes a way of squeezing a large Linux into a very small space,
citing two specific machines as examples.
