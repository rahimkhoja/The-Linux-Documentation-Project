</H2>


<P>Nvidia's drivers for all of their modern video cards are not open source.
Because of this many distributions do not include them. If your Nvidia card is
running slowly this is probably the cause and  you should visit 
<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com">http://www.nvidia.com</A> to download the Linux installer. In the author's
experience these drivers are great, but not all versions work 100% with all
cards and kernels. If you have a misbehaving Nvidia video card, try a different
driver.</P>

<H3>XOrg AGP Issues </H3>


<P>With Nvidia's proprietry drivers installed, Linux can use either AGPGART
or Nvidia's AGP drivers for AGP access. This option is set by "NvAGP" in your
/etc/X11/xorg.conf file.</P>
<P>From Nvidia's README:
<HR>
<PRE>
Option "NvAGP" "integer"

    Configure AGP support. Integer argument can be one of:

        Value             Behavior
        --------------    ---------------------------------------------------
        0                 disable AGP
        1                 use NVIDIA's internal AGP support, if possible
        2                 use AGPGART, if possible
        3                 use any AGP support (try AGPGART, then NVIDIA's

    Please note that NVIDIA's internal AGP support cannot work if AGPGART is
    either statically compiled into your kernel or is built as a module and
    loaded into your kernel.
</PRE>
<HR>

In the author's experience, Nvidia's AGP is necessary in order to get the linux kernel's <B>suspend to ram</B> working properly, and is also slightly faster.
Users with kernels with built-in AGPGART need to add <B>agp=off</B> to their boot
loader in order to use the NvAGP driver.</P>


<H3>Tweaks </H3>


<P>These tweaks are for users with a GeForce video card (or better) and Nvidia's
proprietary drivers.  They are accessed using the bash command <B>export
{variable}={value}</B> and then starting the Quake engine from the same
command line. Alternatively, recent drivers have a <B>nvidia-settings</B>
command which starts up a user-friendly control panel.</P>
<P><EM>Full details of these tweaks are in the Nvidia README, normally installed at "/usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README.txt"</EM>

</H2>


<P>While new versions of XFree and XOrg have great support for Voodoo 3, 4 and 5,
early 3Dfx hardware such as Voodoo1, Voodoo2 and Rush are no longer hardware
accelerated. To get OpenGL working for these cards, you'll need to download,
install and/or compile the software libraries called Glide and Mesa, though this is
not trivial. The author does have precompiled libGL for the Voodoo2,
and his 
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/uhexen2/quake-lq-1.0.1.tgz?download">patched TyrQuake</A> includes proper 3Dfx brightness control.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc9.3">FreeBSD </A>

<P>The author has limited experience with this OS and has tested projects on
FreeBSD 5.3 with Nvidia's proprietary drivers.

<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-3.html#qudos_">QuDos</A> has recently ported several
<A HREF="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake1">engines</A> to Linux and
has recently started work on FreeBSD compatibility. His great 
<A HREF="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake2">Quake II project</A> is
also now BSD friendly.</P>
<P>For basic GLQuake support, you can find a hacked FreeBSD binary and source
tarball

<P>
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-3.html#quakeforge_">QuakeForge</A> is a comprehensive Quake project,
but may have installation issues with newer FreeBSD releases. The memory
allocator routine "alloca" is not correctly detected on FreeBSD 5.3. The fix
is, after running "configure", to add "#define C_ALLOCA 1" to
"include/config.h" and undefine other ALLOCA variables.  Another issue is the
opening of plugins. If the project builds, but you can't get the console or
menus, you may have to enable static plugins using <B>configure
LDFLAGS=-lpthread --with-static-plugins</B>.</P>

<P>QNX is a commercial real-time operating system, probably most notable
to hobbyists as being a successful microkernel OS.
<A HREF="Quake-HOWTO-3.html#sdlquake_">SDL Quake</A>-1.0.9

<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc9.5">Transparent Water and VisPatch </A>
</H2>


<P>The game variable "r_wateralpha" allows for water transparency - but most maps
don't have the necessary "vis" information. There are two ways to get this.
After setting <B>r_wateralpha</B> &lt; 1.0, issuing the
console command <B>r_novis 1</B> enables the game to calculate it's own vis
information at the penalty of cpu cycles.  Alternatively, vispatch is a utility
that patches your Quake/QuakeWorld levels to support transparent water. </P>
<P>To do this you'll need the vispatch utility, as well as the 
<A HREF="http://www.atomicgamer.com/directory.php?id=3138">vispatch data files</A>
for the game you are patching.</P>
<P>To patch the main data files in "id1" -
from your Quake directory - type <B>vispatch -dir id1 -data id1.vis</B></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc9.6">Quake Inspired XTerms </A>
</H2>


<P>Quake's in-game console is a great feature and has been adopted by many
other games. Now you can also use the 'tilda' key to access X terminal windows.
Both 
<A HREF="http://yakuake.uv.ro/">Yakuake</A> and 
<A HREF="http://tilda.sourceforge.net/">Tilda</A> are projects inspired by this
idea.</P>
<P>Unfortunately neither are easy to install from source. Yakuake is a KDE
application and needs the KDE development packages, and compiling Tilda is more
complicated.  It requires a couple of unusual libraries, and gave this author
compilation errors, so perhaps looking for a RPM package is a better choice.
The author can recommend Yakuake as a very handy X terminal.</P>

"... Quake was the first FPS to introduce realistic lighting and
shadows.  Of course, this came at a price. Quake has taken a lot of
flak because it's all dull brown and grey. This was necessary because
it was the only way to get the lighting to work properly. Since each
surface needs a wide variety of reserved colors for displaying
darkened/brightened portions of the surface, the game was limited to
just a few colors and all their respective shades."<BR>

"Almost incidentally, Quake introduced the now-standard concept of a FPS
'console', and popularised 'mouselook' as *the* absolute standard
control interface.  Although the specifications required a Pentium,
Quake ran acceptably well on a 486 DX4/100"
