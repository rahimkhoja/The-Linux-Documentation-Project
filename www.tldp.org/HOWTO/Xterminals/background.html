>2.1. What is XFree86</H2
><P
>XFree86 is an Open Source implementation of the X Windows System (X).  It provides a client-server interface between mouse, keyboard, video display, and a windowed desktop environment.  Because X is network transparent, client programs can be run on a different host machine than the one on which an X Server resides.  </P
><P
>The XFree86 bundle includes a large array of programs including a terminal emulator, clocks, and a mail interface.  This document will focus exclusively on the portions of XFree86  required for maintaining an X Session between an X Terminal and a Linux host.  These are the X Display Manager, xdm, an access control programs and the X Font Server, xfs.</P

>2.2. What is an X Terminal?</H2
><P
>X Terminals are diskless networked microcomputers.  These systems will generally consist of mouse, monitor, keyboard, RAM, battery-powered NVRAM, and secondary ports for connecting peripheral devices such as printer, bar code scanner, etc.  Because they are diskless, X Terminals load their operating system, configuration information, and fonts into memory from a host machine running nfs or tftp, and xfs.  </P
><P
>The Operating System of an X Terminal will provide basic administrative interface for configuration parameters such as tcp, xdmcp, font path, boot path, and other host-related configurations.  It's primary function, however, is to act as an X Server  which exchanges mouse, keyboard, and other display information with client applications loaded on a remote host.  </P

>2.3. Infrastructure Overview</H2
><P
>The canonical way of deploying X Terminal systems on an IP-based network is to use the Bootstrap protocol, bootp, to provide client and host ip addresses and to request a bootable image to mount the operating system.  Clients may also store this information from their own NVRAM which mitigates the need for fetching it off of a network.  NFS or TFTP is utilized to load the os image and system fonts into RAM on the client machine.  XDM provides ip-based authentication and management of the display session using XDMCP. XFS may optionally be run on the host to provide anti-aliasing fonts to the client system (highly recommended).  TCP is commonly the transport layer for all client-server interaction.  </P
