<P>LBX is useless, of course, if you're only running applications
locally, or if you're not running X at all.
<P>Also, if you're running on a fast LAN, LBX won't be much help.  Some
people say "if LBX cuts down on network traffic, wouldn't it be good to
use even on fast LANs?"  It might be, if your goal is to reduce network
traffic.  But if your goal is to get better response time LBX probably
isn't what you want.  Although it does introduce caching and
compression, that comes at a cost on both ends (extra memory for
caching, and extra CPU for decompression).  If your link is fairly
speedy LBX will probably result in an overall slowdown.
