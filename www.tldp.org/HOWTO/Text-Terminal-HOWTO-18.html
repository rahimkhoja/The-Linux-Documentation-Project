<H2><A NAME="term_as_console"></A> <A NAME="ss18.1">18.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc18.1">Make a Serial Terminal the Console </A>
</H2>

<P> This will turn a text-terminal (or emulator PC) into a "serial
console".  Many messages from the system are normally only sent to the
console (the PC monitor).  Some of the messages sent to the console at
boot-time may also be seen on any terminal after the boot succeeds by
typing the command: dmesg.  If the boot failed this will not be of any
use since the terminal can't work without an operating system.  It's
possible to modify the Linux kernel so as to make a terminal serve as
the console and receive all the messages from Linux intended for the
console.  Unfortunately, the messages from the BIOS (which display on
the monitor when a PC is first started) will not display on this
terminal (but still display on the monitor).</P>
<P>There's a Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO on this topic.  Some people use
a serial console when they run a PC without a monitor or keyboard.
Normally, a PC will not start up without a keyboard and video card but
some BIOSs permit it.  If you are lucky enough to have such a BIOS
that supports "console re-direct" you will likely then need to setup
the BIOS using the CMOS menus when you start your PC.</P>
<P>The method of creating a "serial console" depends on your kernel
version.  In any case serial support needs to be compiled into the
kernel and not supplied as a module.</P>

<H3>For Kernels 2.2 or higher</H3>

<P> The instructions for creating a serial-console are included with
the kernel documentation in: Documentation/serial-console.txt.
Kernel 2.4+ has better documentation and mentions the need to run
getty on the serial port.  Normally, the device /dev/console is linked
to tty0 (the PC console).  For a serial-console you create a new
/dev/console by
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mknod -m 622 console c 5 1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You must also put statements regarding the serial-console into
/etc/lilo.conf and then run lilo.  This is because the equivalent of
"setserial" needs to be run early before the kernel is loaded so that
the serial-console can display the booting.  See the above mentioned
kernel documentation and the man page for lilo.conf for more details.</P>
<P>Here is an example <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file contents (for ttyS0):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
prompt
timeout=50
boot = /dev/sda
vga = normal # force sane state
install = /boot/boot.b
message = /boot/message
image = /vmlinuz
root = /dev/sda1
label = console
serial = 0,9600n8
append = "console=ttyS0"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The same PC may have more than one serial console but the last console
mentioned in the "append" statement becomes the main console that you
interact with ??  See the kernel docs (but it's not too clear).</P>

<H3>Serial-Console For Kernels before 2.2</H3>

<P> The Linux Journal in April 1997 had an article on patching
the Linux kernel.  You add a couple of #defines at the start of
src/linux/drivers/char/console.c:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#define CONFIG_SERIAL_ECHO
#define SERIAL_ECHO_PORT 0x2f8  /* Serial port address  */

The following was not in the Linux Journal article.
In kernel 2.+ (and earlier ??) you need to also set the baud
rate (unless 9600 is OK).  Find these 2 lines:

serial_echo_outb(0x00, UART_DLM); /* 9600 baud */
serial_echo_outb(0x0c, UART_DLL);

Change 0x0c in the line above (depending on the baud rate you want):

115200 baud: 0x01       19200 baud: 0x06        2400 baud: 0x30
57600 baud: 0x02         9600 baud: 0x0c        1200 baud: 0x60
38400 baud: 0x03         4800 baud: 0x18
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you currently use the console to select which operating system to
boot (using LILO), but would like to do this from a terminal, then you
need to add a line to the /etc/lilo.conf file.   See the manual page
for lilo.conf and search for "serial=".</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.2">18.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc18.2">Run Linux without a Monitor</A>
</H2>

<P> One way to do this is to just use a terminal (serial console) for
the monitor See 
<A HREF="#term_as_console">Make a Serial Terminal the Console</A>.  You may still need a video card since many BIOSs
require one to get the PC started.  Your BIOS may also require a
keyboard to get started or it may have an option where you can set the
BIOS not to require a keyboard.</P>
<P>If you boot without a monitor, make sure that the boot loader (such as
LILO or GRUB) doesn't try to present any image on the screen.  A
text-terminal can't display it and the booting may hang.</P>
<P>If you have a keyboardless terminal, it can also be used as a monitor
by use of the ttysnoop program.  As of yet, it doesn't work like a
console since it doesn't get all the initial boot-time messages.  See
<A HREF="#keyboardless_terminal">Use a Keyboardless Terminal as the Monitor</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="keyboardless_terminal"></A> <A NAME="ss18.3">18.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc18.3">Use a Keyboardless Terminal as the Monitor </A>
</H2>

<H3>How it works</H3>

<P> While you might think that a terminal without a keyboard is
useless it is possible to use it as the monitor and type on the PC's
own keyboard.  This may be done by using the spy program
<CODE>ttysnoop</CODE>.  This program permits a person at one terminal to spy
on (or snoop) what someone else is typing at another terminal (or the
PC console-monitor).</P>
<P>Now suppose you are typing away at the monitor tty1.  Imagine that
someone with a terminal on ttyS2 is spying on you (with ttysnoop) and
has a screen that looks just like your screen.  Everything you type
at tty1 also displays on ttyS2.  Now move the spy terminal (on ttyS2)
so it is side-by-side with your monitor (on tty1).  Everything you
type on the PC keyboard will now display on the two screens in front
of you: the monitor and the spy terminal.  Now just look only at the
spy terminal as you type.  Disconnect both the monitor and the
terminal keyboard since you're not using either.  Thus you are now
using a keyboardless terminal as a monitor.  What a simple but clever
solution!</P>
<P>One possible problem (which turns out to be no problem at all) is
that normally, the type of spy terminal should be the same as the type
of terminal being spied upon.  Since the monitor is normally declared
as a terminal of type "linux" (which is close to vt100), you might
think that the real terminal should also be (or at least emulate) a
vt100.  Not necessarily so!  For example, if you have a wyse60
terminal you simply falsely declare that you have a wyse terminal on
tty1 (tell the getty program for tty1 that it's a wyse60).</P>
<P>Here's why you can get away with this.  Go back the scenario where
you have both the monitor and the wyse60 terminal in front of you,
both displaying the same thing (or trying to).  Ttysnoop will be
sending the wyse60 the same bytes as are going to the monitor.  If
you've falsely claimed that the monitor is a wyse60, then you'll have
wyse60  escape sequences going to both the monitor and the wyse60
terminal (via ttysnoops).  The display on the wyse60 is fine but the
display on the monitor is corrupted since it's getting wyse60 escape
sequences.  Since you will not use the monitor (and are about to
disconnect it) this corruption is never a problem (you simply don't
see it).</P>

<H3>Example configuration</H3>

<P> This is not the ideal setup since ttysnoop runs so late that the
login prompt doesn't appear.  This example is for a wyse60 terminal on
ttyS2 and the missing monitor/PC-keyboard on tty1.  It uses the agetty
program for getty as supplied by the Debian distribution.   Your getty
may require a different format.</P>
<P>In <CODE>/etc/inittab:</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 wyse60 -ln /usr/sbin/ttysnoops
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note that <CODE>ttysnoop/ttysnoops</CODE> is a client-server combo so the
"s" is not a typo.  If you don't use -n you may not see a login prompt
on the terminal.  With no -n, agetty issues the prompt before the
ttysnoop is activated.  With -n, agetty doesn't issue the prompt (but
login does instead).  If you use -n, agetty will no longer
automatically detect parity but if you don't use parity all is OK.</P>
<P>In <CODE>/etc/snooptab:</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tty       snoopdev      type    execpgm
tty1        /dev/ttyS3    init    /usr/local/bin/sterm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In the above, a script named sterm is used to run the stty program.
You may not need this or may want to use it for another purpose.
Here's the example sterm script in <CODE>/usr/local/bin/sterm:</CODE></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
stty rows 24
/bin/login $@
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
