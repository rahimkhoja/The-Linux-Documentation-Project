>E.1. Considerations when buying second-hand terminal
   servers</H1
><P
>Internet Service Providers have been large users of terminal
   servers in the past.  Each modem would be connected to a terminal
   server port and incoming users would be permitted to send
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IP</SPAN
> packets anywhere, not just to some predefined
   minicomputer.  Manufacturers renamed the equipment to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"access
   servers"</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"modem servers"</SPAN
> to reflect this new
   use.</P
><P
>These access servers have been superseded by a new generation
   which allows telephone trunks to be plugged directly into the
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ISP</SPAN
>'s router.  There are no discrete modems; the
   modem tones are decoded by digital signal processing chips within
   the router.  As a result terminal servers are currently readily
   available on the second-hand market.</P
><P
>When purchasing a second-hand terminal server ensure that you
   are also buying the rights to the software.  Some companies license
   their software and have contract terms which state that the license
   cannot be resold, but has to be repurchased from the company if the
   terminal server changes hands.</P
><P
>Many vendors require a current maintenance contract to obtain
   software updates.  These maintenance agreements can be expensive, a
   common figure is 15% per annum of the manufacturer's retail price.
   You may be able to source a cheaper software updates from a
   third-party maintenance supplier.</P
><P
>Many older terminal servers are no longer sold or supported
   by their vendors.  Search the vendor's web site for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"end of
   life"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Vendor support can be a particular issue when the
   most-recently available software does not fit within the
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RAM</SPAN
> or flash memory contraints of the terminal
   server you have purchased.  You should check this before purchasing
   a seond-hand terminal server.  Upgrading flash memory can be
   particularly difficult, as the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ROM</SPAN
> on the
   motherboard may also need to be replaced with one aware of the new
   flash memory's characteristics.<A

   usually supply <SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

>.</P
><P
>Most old terminal servers will not support
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Secure Shell</SPAN
>.  In this is the case
   accessing the terminal server by its ethernet port is a poor idea:
   when you login to the console you password will travel across the
   Internet in clear text.  Either dial in to the terminal server or
   use a one-time password system such as the
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
><SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RADIUS</SPAN
></SPAN
> protocol with
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>S/KEY</SPAN
> authentication.</P
><P
>An alternative to using a terminal server is to use a
   multiport serial card in another <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Linux</SPAN
> system.</P

     identifies itself with a model designator rather than with the
     timings required to read and write the memory.  So to load
     software from flash memory the boot <SPAN
