>1.2. Why use a serial console?</H1
><P
>For the average user a serial console has no advantage over a
   console offered by a directly attached keyboard and screen.  Serial
   consoles are much slower, taking up to a second to fill a 80 column
   by 24 line screen.  Serial consoles generally only support
   non-proportional <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ASCII</SPAN
> text, with limited
   support for languages other than English.  A new terminal can be
   more expensive than an old <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PC</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>There are some scenarios where serial consoles are
   useful. These are:</P
><P

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Linux</SPAN
> is a good
      operating system for deployment at unstaffed sites.  <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Linux</SPAN
> is also good for hosting
      critical network infrastructure such as <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DNS</SPAN
>
      and <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DHCP</SPAN
> services.  These services are
      generally installed at every site of an organisation including
      sites which may be too small or too remote to have information
      technology staff.</P
><P
>System administration of these remote computers is usually
      done using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
><SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SSH</SPAN
></SPAN
>, but
      there are times when access to the console is the only way to
      diagnose and correct software failures.  Major upgrades to the
      installed distribution may also require console access.</P
><P
>In these cases the serial console is attached to a modem.
      Access to the console is gained from a remote computer by
      dialing into the modem.  This allows the console to be reached
      from any telephone socket.</P
></DD
><DT
>High density racks of computers</DT
><DD
><P
>Clusters of personal computers can outperform mainframe
      computers and form competitive supercomputers for some
      applications.  See the <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Cluster-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
><I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Cluster-HOWTO</I
></A
>
      for more information on clustering.</P
><P
>These clusters are typically assembled into 19 inch
      telecommunications equipment racks and the system unit of each
      computer is typically one rack unit (or 1.75 inches) tall.  It
      is not desirable to put a keyboard and monitor on each computer,
      as a small cathode ray tube monitor would consume the space used
      by sixteen rack units.</P
><P
>A first glance it seems that a monitor and keyboard switch
      is the best solution.  However the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VGA</SPAN
> signal
      to the monitor is small, so even with the switch the monitor
      cannot be placed very far away from the rack of
      computers.</P
><P
>It is desirable to allow the consoles to be monitored in
      the operators' room of the computer center, rather than in the
      very expensive space of the machine room.  Although monitor
      switches with remote control and fiber optical extensions are
      available, this solution can be expensive.</P
><P
>A standard <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RS-232</SPAN
> cable can be 15
      meters in length.  Longer distances are easily possible. The
      cabling is cheap.  Terminal servers can be used to allow one
      terminal to access up to 90 serial consoles.</P
></DD
><DT
>Recording console messages</DT
><DD
><P
>This is useful in two very different cases.</P
><P
>Kernel programmers are often faced with a kernel error
      message that is displayed a split second before the computer
      reboots.  A serial console can be used to record that
      message. Another <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Linux</SPAN
>
      machine can be used as the serial terminal.</P
><P
>Some secure installations require all security events to
      be unalterably logged.  One way to meet this requirement is to
      print all console messages.  Connecting the serial console to a
      serial printer can achieve this.<A

>A serial port is a cheap way to allow software developers
      to directly access the embedded computer.  This is invaluable
      for debugging.  Most chip sets designed for embedded computers
      have a serial port precisely for this purpose.</P

      Linux</A

      trend.</P
><P
>Most telecommunications equipment is remotely managed from
      a distant computer.  However, site technicans (called
      <I
CLASS="WORDASWORD"
>craft personnel</I
> in telco-speak) need to
      access the equipment to test installation changes, check the
      status of reported faults, and so on.  The terminal used by the
      craft personnel is called the <I
CLASS="WORDASWORD"
>craft
      terminal</I
>.  The craft terminal plugs into the
      <I
CLASS="WORDASWORD"
>craft interface</I
> on the equipment.  The
      serial console makes an ideal craft interface.</P

CLASS="ACRONYM"

   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>PC</SPAN
></SPAN
> was not designed to use a
   serial console.  This has two consequences.</P
><P
>Firstly, Power On Self-Test messages and Basic Input/Output
   System (<SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
>) messages are sent to the screen
   and received from the keyboard.  This makes it difficult to use the
   serial port to reconfigure the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
> and
   impossible to see Power On Self-Test errors.</P
><P
>An increasing number of manufacturers of rackable
   <EM
>server</EM
> equipment are altering their
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
>s to optionally use the
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RS-232</SPAN
> port for BIOS configuration and test
   messages.  If you are buying a machine specifically for use with
   serial console you should seek this feature.  If you have an
   existing machine that definitely requires access to the
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BIOS</SPAN
> from the serial port then there are
   hardware solutions such as <A

>Secondly, the <SPAN

> port on the
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
><SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

>
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"

   modem.  Thus a null modem cable is needed when connecting the PC's
   serial port to a terminal.</P
