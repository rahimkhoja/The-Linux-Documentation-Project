>There is no world-wide approval processes to certify that a
   modem is suitable for connection to the telephone network.  This is
   despite the presence of a common set of technical standards that
   modems must meet for use on the global switched telephone network.
   There is little or no recognition of one nation's approvals by
   other national regulators.</P
><P
>There are national technical requirements concerning the use
   of modems. Common requirements are to set the modem and its
   software to answer after the second ring and never to dial the same
   engaged or faulty number more than five times in a row.</P

>Do not assume that Touch Tone dialling is globally available.
   There is no common standard for decadic dialling: some countries
   have the longest sequence for zero, other countries have the
   shortest sequence for zero.</P
><P
>There is little coordination of national numbering plans.  Be
   careful not to call a national emergency services number when
   intending to dial the international access code.  Common emergency
   services numbers are: 112, 911, 000.  International access codes
   vary by country.</P
><P
>Intelligent network features such as toll-free numbers are
   usually not available to calls originating from abroad.</P
><P
>International calls may be routed through fiber optical
   submarine cable, satelite or High Frequency radio.  The possible
   bit rates vary considerably between these options.  Expect the
   maximum throughput with no errors from fiber optical submarine
   cable.  Expect 1200<SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>bps</SPAN
> to
   2400<SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"

   distance.  If the latency becomes greater than the modem's error
   correction window then you will get better

> file transfer performance if you
   disable the <SPAN

>-based error correction in the
   modems.</P
><P
>International calls may have their signal altered
   considerably.  Traditionally, international calls are placed
   through analogue conditioning circuits to minimise echo.  This
   conditioning limits the maximum bit rate a modem can achieve,
   probably to less than 9600<SPAN
CLASS="ABBREV"
>bps</SPAN
>.  You may be able to program a
   <I
CLASS="WORDASWORD"
>guard tone</I
> to disable analogue
   conditioning, this will vary by carrier and the commands to send
   the guard tone vary by modem.</P
><P
>On some modern international circuits, particularly those
   accessed by international calling cards, digital voice compression
   is used.  No reliable modem connection can be established over
   these digitally-compressed circuits.  The best current tactic for
   identifying these digitally compressed circuits is to listen to the
   background noise &#8212; when no-one is speaking the real
   background noise will be replaced by a synthesized background noise
   (a compression technique called <I
CLASS="WORDASWORD"
>silence
   suppression</I
>).</P
