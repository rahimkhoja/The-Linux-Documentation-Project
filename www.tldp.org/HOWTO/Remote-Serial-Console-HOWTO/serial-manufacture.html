>11.5. Making serial cables</H1
><P
>If you use a serial console for densely-racked computers you
   will end up making a lot of null-modem serial cables.  This section
   has some hints on making serial cables.  If you are making more
   than ten cables and live in a city you will probably find it
   economic to have the cables made by a specialty cabling
   firm.</P
><P
>Attempt to minimise noise in your cabling design.  Many BIOSs
   and boot loaders will wait forever if they receive a single
   character of line noise.  You might choose to use shielded UTP
   cables (these require special RJ-45 plugs but use standard RJ-45
   sockets).</P
><P
>If the environment has a lot of radio frequency noise then
   use traditional shielded cable and metal RS-232 connector shells.
   Connect the shield in the cable to the computer at
   <EM
>one</EM
> end.  This can be done by connecting the
   drain wire of the shield it to the Protective Ground (if present)
   or by soldering the drain wire to the shell of the connector.  If
   there is a substantial amount of noise also place a ferrite core
   over the shielded cable at both ends of the cable.  Follow the
   usual good practices of making the cable to the correct length and
   screwing home the D connectors into the chassis.</P
><P
>If you are making one of these cables and have some soldering
   skill, you can easily do the jumpering of the signal wires within
   the backshell of the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DB9</SPAN
> or
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DB25</SPAN
> connector.</P
><P
>If you are making a large number of cables then crimping
   systems are much faster than soldering.  Again, pin jumpering can
   be done within the backshell.</P
><P
>No matter what system is adopted, use the Resistance setting
   of a multimeter to check for dead and shorted pins.  A minute here
   can save hours later.</P
><P
>For structured cabling systems, space is tight within
   <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DB9/RJ-45</SPAN
> backshells, so the jumpering is better
   done behind the patch panel.  The <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DB9/RJ-45</SPAN
>
   connectors present the <SPAN

> pinout at the DB9 connector and
   present the Yost or Cisco pinout at the <SPAN

   connector.</P
