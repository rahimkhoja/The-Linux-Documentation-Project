<UL>
<LI> Ppa ZIP drive and disk.</LI>
<LI> 2 blank 1.44 floppy disks</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>After spending a few hours wrestling with dpkg I decided it would be
simpler to modify the Debian "Rescue" disk so that it would
recognize the ppa ZIP drive.  This proved to be very easy.  You can
then use this modified disk to procede through the normal Debian
base system install.  Once you've completed installing the base
system you can use a boot disk to start the new base system and
complete the installation using dselect.  To use this technique you
need to build two kernels - one with ppa and initial RAM disk
support, and another without the RAM disk support.
<P>If you want, you can skip all the steps in section 2 and let the
Debian install procedure handle formatting the ZIP disk for you.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Creating the modified Rescue disk</A>
</H2>

<P>The Debian rescue disk is a SYSLINUX style boot disk, which uses
a DOS formatted floppy disk and a special boot loader to avoid
loading MS-DOS.  These disks are very easy to modify to start your
own custom boot configuration.  The Debian 'boot-floppies' package
contains a set of scripts to automate the process of building boot
disks.  However, its so simple I found it easier to do the process
by hand.  This deviates a bit from the Debian philosophy, but I'm
over it :).  There are brief instructions in the 'readme.txt' file
of the Rescue floppy.
<P>
<H3>Use dd (or RAWRITE under DOS) to create a new Rescue disk.</H3>

<P>Review the Debian install docs if you don't remember how to do this.
<P>
<H3>Build a new kernel with ZIP ppa support</H3>

<P>Build a new kernel with ZIP ppa support (as in step 3.3.1), but also
configure RAM disk and initial RAM disk support.  You also need to
configure the msdos, fat, minix, ext2fs, and procfs filesystems.
<P>Also configure any modules that you would like in your final
installation on the ZIP disk.
<P>Once the kernel is configured, build with:
<P><B> ==> make dep; make clean</B>
<P><I><B> ==> make bzImage</B></I>
<P>Build the modules with:
<P><B> ==> make modules</B>
<P>You will install these later.

          NOTE: Make sure that you are using 'make bzImage', and
                not 'make zImage'.

<P>
<H3>Mount the new Rescue disk.</H3>

<P><B> ==> fdmount fd0</B>
<P>or
<P><B> ==> mount /dev/fd0 /mnt</B>
<P>or
<P><B> ==> whatever :)</B>
<P>
<H3>Copy the kernel image</H3>

<P>Copy the kernel image (on the i386 platform it will be located at
arch/i386/boot/bzImage) to 'linux' on the floppy disk.
<P>
<H3>Editing the 'rdev.sh' script</H3>

<P>Open the 'rdev.sh' script located on the Rescue floppy with your favorite
editor. Change the last line:
from--:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       'rdev /mnt/linux /dev/ram0'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to--:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       'rdev /mnt/linux /dev/sda1'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You will also have to change all occurences of /mnt/linux to the
appropriate path.  Since I mount my floppies under /fd0, I had to
change /mnt/linux to /fd0/linux.
<P>
<H3>Run this modified 'rdev.sh' script.</H3>

<P><B> ==> ./rdev.sh</B>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Install the base system on the ZIP drive.</A>
</H2>

<P>Boot your modified Rescue disk.  If all goes correctly you will be
presented with the familiar Debian menu based install process,
except that now it is aware of your ppa ZIP drive.  Procede through
this process as if you were installing the system on a normal hard
drive, but mount /dev/sda1 as root and initialize /dev/sda2 as swap.
<P>There is one deviation from the standard install process-- don't
install and/or configure any loadable modules. You will install the
modules you built in step 7.3.2 later.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Creating the boot disk</A>
</H2>

<P>You can create the boot disk just as described in steps 3.3.1 to
3.3.2, or, if you want, just use the "Create Boot Disk" option
during the Debian install. I like this second option because I get
another SYSLINUX boot disk, allowing me to edit the greeting message
to describe the nature of my custom boot floppy and allow me to
enter additional kernel arguments. You can even include help files,
accessible via the functions keys. You may still wish to rebuild the
kernel and modify this boot disk by hand later to remove the RAM
disk support. Your call.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Reboot the system.</A>
</H2>

<P>Insert your boot disk and choose the 'Reboot' option from the
install menu.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 Configure the base system and complete the install process.</A>
</H2>

<P>When the system reboots you will have a slow but completely
workable Debian base installation running off of your ppa ZIP drive.
Proceed normally with the installation at this point. I installed
all the normal UNIX utilities, along with documentation sets, make,
gcc, libraries, and various useful file manipulation utilities. The
result is a very powerful emergency boot system that I can use to
rescue any of the systems in our department in an emergency.

        NOTE: You'll at least need to install 'make' to
              complete the next step.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8 Installing the modules you built in step 7.3.2.</A>
</H2>

<P>If you installed make in the last step, you should be able to mount
the hard drive partition containing your kernel build, cd to the
proper directory and run 'make modules_install'.
Here's how I did it:
<P><B> ==> mount /dev/hda2 /mnt </B>
<P><B> ==> cd /mnt/usr/src/linux </B>
<P><B> ==> make modules_install </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<PRE>
        NOTE: You won't need to modify the /etc/fstab file, as explained
              in step 5.  The Debian installation process has already
              taken care of that.
