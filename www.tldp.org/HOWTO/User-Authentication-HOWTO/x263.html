>4. Securing User Authentication</H1
><P
>   Many linux distributions ship with user authentication that is not adequately secure. This section discusses some of the ways you make user authentication secure on your system. While doing these things will make your system more secure, do not be so naive as to think they make you invulnerable.

Short of a bug in PAM, this configuration is brutally secure. The only problem with that brutality is it may cause problems if your accidentally delete the configuration of another service. If your <TT

>4.2. Disabling logins for user with null passwords</H2
><P
>    On most linux systems, there a number of "dummy" user accounts, used to assign privileges to certain system services like ftp, webservers, and mail gateways. Having these accounts allows your system to be more secure, because if these services are compromised, an attacker will only gain the limited privileges available to the dummy account, rather than the full privileges of a service running as root. However, allowing these dummy account login privileges is a security risk, as they usually have blank (null) passwords. The configuration option that enables null passwords is the "nullok" module-argument. You'll want to remove this argument from any modules of 'auth' type for services that allow login. This is usually the login service, but it may also include services like rlogin and ssh. Hence, the following line in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.d/login</TT
>:

>4.3. Disable unused services</H2
><P
>    Looking at the files in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.d/</TT
>, you'll probably see configuration files for a number of programs you don't use and maybe even a few you've never heard of. Although allowing authentication to these services probably won't open any huge security holes, you're better off denying them authentication. The best way to disable PAM authentication for these programs is to rename these files. Not finding the file named after the service requesting authentication, PAM will fallback to the (hopefully) very secure <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.d/other</TT
>. If you later find that you need one of these programs, you can simply rename the file to its original name and everything will work as it was intended.

>4.4. Password-cracking tools</H2
><P
>    While password-cracking tools can be used by attackers to compromise a system, they can also be used by system administrators as proactive tool to ensure the strength of passwords on their system. The two most commonly used password-cracking tools are "crack" and "John the Ripper". Crack is probably included in your favorite distribution. John the Ripper can be obtained from <A
HREF="http://www.false.com/security/john/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.false.com/security/john/index.html</A
>. Run the tools against your password database and you'll probably be surprised with what they come up with.
   </P
><P
>    Additionally, there is a PAM module which utilizes the crack library to check the strength of a users password whenever it changed. When this module is installed, the user can only change their password to one which meets the minimum password strength.

>4.5. Shadow and MD5 passwords</H2
><P
>    As was discussed in the first section of this document, Shadow and MD5 passwords can make your system more secure. During the installation procedure, most modern distributions will ask whether you want to install MD5 and/or Shadow passwords. Unless you have a good reason not to, you should enable these. The process of converting from non-shadowed/non-MD5 passwords is a complicated process, and is beyond the scope of this document. The <A
