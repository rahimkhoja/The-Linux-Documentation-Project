>3.1. Why</H2
><P
>   Back in the good old days of linux, if a program, such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>su</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>passwd</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>login</SPAN
>, or <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>xlock</SPAN
>, needed to authenticate a user, it would simply read the necessary information from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
>. If it needed to change the users' password, it would simply edit <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
>. This simple but clumsy method presented numerous problems for system administrators and application developers. As MD5 and shadow passwords became increasingly popular, each program requiring user authentication had to know how to get the proper information when dealing with a number of different schemes. If you wanted to change your user authentication scheme, all these programs had to be recompiled. PAM eliminates this mess by enabling programs to transparently authenticate users, regardless of how user information is stored.

><P
>   Quoting from the <A
HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/Linux-PAM-html/pam.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux-PAM System Administrator's Guide</A
>: "It is the purpose of the Linux-PAM project to separate the development of privilege granting software from the development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes. This is accomplished by providing a library of functions that an application may use to request that a user be authenticated." With PAM, it doesn't matter whether your password is stored in /etc/passwd or on a server in Hong Kong. When a program needs to authenticate a user, PAM provides a library containing the functions for the proper authentication scheme. Because this library is loaded dynamically, changing authentication schemes can be done by simply editing a configuration file.
  </P
><P
>   Flexibility is one of PAM's greatest strengths. PAM can be configured to deny certain programs the right to authenticate users, to only allow certain users to be authenticated, to warn when certain programs attempt to authenticate, or even to deprive all users of login privileges. PAM's modular design gives you complete control over how users are authenticated.

>3.2.2. Installing PAM</H3
><P
>   Installing PAM from scratch is long process, beyond the scope of this HOWTO. If PAM isn't installed on your system, you're probably running such an old version of your distribution that there are many other reasons to upgrade. If you really want to do it yourself, then you're certainly not the sort of person who needs any help from me. For all these reasons, I'm going to assume that you already have PAM installed.

>3.3.2. A little something</H3
><P
>   A small percentage of the readers are probably thinking, "Oh no! I don't have a /etc/pam.d directory! Your list of distributions says that my distribution includes PAM, but I can't find that directory. Without PAM, my life is empty and meaningless! What can I do?" Don't worry, all is not lost. If you know that your distribution includes PAM, but you have no <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.d/</TT
> directory, then your PAM configuration is stored in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.conf</TT
>. Rather than being spread across several files, all your PAM configuration is stored in a single file. This adds a little twist to PAM  configuration, but the proper adjustments are pointed out in section 3.3.4.
