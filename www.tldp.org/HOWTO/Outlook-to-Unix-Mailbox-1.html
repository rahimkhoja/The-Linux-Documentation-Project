<P>While several programs exist to convert some formats such as Microsoft
Outlook Express to Unix formats, Outlook users have a bit more of a
challenge. One way to convert uses Mozilla Mail under Windows; another
involves a more complicated method. Both are explained in this
miniHOWTO.
<P>
<P>The database format that Outlook uses for .PST files, called Jet, is
documented at:

<A HREF="http://www.emailman.com/conversion/index.html">http://www.emailman.com/conversion/index.html</A><P>I've had a claim that the program Kmailcvt now converts Outlook
mailboxes. However, I'm not 100% sure that this claim is true, since
Kmailcvt definitely converts Outlook Express mailboxes, which are
completely different from Outlook mailboxes. So, if you figure this
out, please let me know.
