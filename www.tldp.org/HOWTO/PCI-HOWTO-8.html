I (now) use kernel 2.0.22 with APM enabled, and the hard drives power

</H2>

<P>
<P>Guido Trentalancia (guido@gulliver.unian.it) reported the California
Graphics - Sunray II Pro with Triton chipset to work well with
Pentium100, Hd: Conner cfs420a, Conner cfs210a, crunching numbers at
147492 dhrystones/second.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Micronics P54i-90 (root@intellibase.gte.com)</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Pentium with 90Mhz, 32M RAM and 512K L2-cache. Works extremely well (a
kernel recompile takes 10 minutes :-). 
<P>
<P>The board includes:
<UL>
<LI> UART - two 16550A high speed UARTS</LI>
<LI> ECP - one enhanced parallel port</LI>
<LI> Onboard IDE controller</LI>
<LI> Onboard floppy controller</LI>
</UL>
<P>Pros: Currently, I'm using it with an Adaptec 1542CF and a 1G Seagate drive,
No problems. Graphics is ATI Graphics Pro Turbo (PCI). Very fast. The
serial ports can keep up with a TeleBit T3000 modem (38400) without overruns.
Caching above 16M does occur. There are 3 banks of SIMM slots (2 SIMM's per
bank), with each bank capable of 64M each (2 32M 72-pin SIMM's). Each bank
must be filled completely to be used (I'm only using bank 0 with 2 16Mx72-pin
SIMM's). The CPU socket is a ZIF type socket. The BIOS is Phoenix, FLASH
type.
<P>Drawbacks: RAM is expandable to 192M, but the L2 cache is maxed at
512K. While the graphics are very fast, there is currently no XF86
server for the Mach64 (well, actually there is, but it doesn't use
any of the accelerator features; it's just an SVGA server). I don't
know if the onboard IDE hard drive controller works; I'm prejudiced against
a standard that won't allow my peripherals to operate across platforms, so
I didn't buy an IDE disk; instead, I got a Seagate 31200N and a NEC 3Xi.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Angelo Haritsis (ah@doc.ic.ac.uk) about SA486P AIO-II:</A>
</H2>

<P>The motherboard I eventually bought (in the UK) is one supporting
486 SX/DX/DX2/DX4 chips. It is called SA486P AIO-II. Features include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Intel Saturn v2 chipset</LI>
<LI> Phoenix BIOS (flash eprom option)</LI>
<LI> NCR scsi BIOS v 3.04.00</LI>
<LI> 256K 15ns cache (max 512) write back and write through</LI>
<LI> 4 72-pin SIMM slots in 2 banks</LI>
<LI> 3 PCI slots, 4 ISA</LI>
<LI> On-board NCR 53c810 scsi controller</LI>
<LI> On-board IDE / floppy / 2 x 16550A uarts / enhanced parallel</LI>
</UL>
<P>I bought it from a company (UK) called ICS, (note I have no 
connections whatsoever with the company, just a happy customer). I use a 486/DX2-66 CPU.
<P>Before I had a VLB 486 m/board with a buslogic BT-445S controller that
I was borrowing. I have 2 scsi devices: 1 barracuda 2.1GB ST12550N disk
and a Wangtek 5525ES tape drive.
I was expecting a lot of adventures by switching to the new motherboard,
esp after hearing all these non-success stories on the net. To my
surprise everything worked flawlessly on the 1st boot! (1.1.50). And it 
has been doing so for about a month now. I did not even have to repartition
the disk: apparently the disk geometry bios translation of the 2 
controllers is the same.
Linux has had no problems at all. SCSI is visibly much faster as well
(sorry, I have no actual performance measurements).
<P>The only problems (related to Drew's linux ncr53c7,810 scsi driver - thanks
for the good work Drew!) are: 
<UL>
<LI> no synchronous transfers are yet supported => performance hit</LI>
<LI> disconnect/reconnect is disabled => disk scsi ops "hold" during certain 
slow scsi device opeartions (eg tape rewind)</LI>
<LI> tagged queuing is not there (?) => performance hit</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you get Windows complainingg about 32-bit disk driver problems, just
disable 32-bit disk access via Control Panel. This should not hurt 
performance. (What I did is remove the WDCTRL driver from my SYSTEM.INI).
<P>All else is fine. I tried the serial ports with some dos/windows s/w
and worked ok. The IDE/floppy work ok as well. I have not tried the parallel
yet. The motherboard is quite fast and so far I am very pleased with the 
upgrade. I have not yet tried a PCI graphics board. I will later
on. I am using an old ISA S3 which is fine at the moment. 
<P>PS: the NCR drivers in the 2.0.x kernels should have no problems of
that kind anymore. please consult the SCSI-HOWTO for further and
hopefully more uptodate information.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 zenon@resonex.com about Gateway2000 P-66 </A>
</H2>

<P>Gateway2000's P5-66 system with Intel's PCI motherboard,
with 5 ISA slots and 3 PCI slots.
The only PCI card I am using is the # 9 GXe level 12 PCI card (2 MB VRAM and
1 MB DRAM). This card was bought from Dell. Under Linux I am using
the graphics in the 80x25 mode only (I am waiting for some XFree86
refinements before using it in 1280x1024 resolution), but under
DOS/Windows I have used the card in 1280x1024x256 mode without
problems. Etherlink 3C509 Ethernet card, Mitsumi bus-interface
card, Adaptec 1542C SCSI interface card and additional serial/parallel
ports card (which makes the total of serial ports 3).
<P>I have total of 32 MB RAM (recognized and used by both Linux and DOS).
There is also a bus mouse (Microsoft in the PS2 mode).   
<P>No problems so far.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.12">8.12 Jermoe Meyers (jeromem@amiserv.xnet.com) with Intel Premiere</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Motherboard - Intel Premiere Plato-babyAT 90mhz with Buslogic bt946c
w/4.86 mcode w/4.22 autoSCSI firmware, (note, mine came with 4.80
mcode and 4.17 autoSCSI firmware. (interrupt pins A,B,C conform to
respective PCI slots!) ATI Xpression (Mach64) - using driver from
sunsite, (running AcerView 56L monitor).
<P>The motherboard has 4 IDE drives, Linux (Slackware 2.0) sees
the first two and everything on the Buslogic as it
emulates an adaptec 1542.  Uh, yes, Dos sees them all.
Buslogic is VERY accomodating in regards to shipping
upgraded chips (you will have to know how to change
PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier) chips, 3 of them.      
Though, don't let that scare you :-) it's not that tough.
Get a low end PLCC removal tool, and your in business.
You also might want to "flash upgrade your system bios from
Intel's IPAN BBS, a trivial process.  Whats even more
interesting is I also have a Sound Blaster SCSI-2 running
a scsi CDROM drive off it's adaptech 1522 onboard controller.
So thats 4 IDE drives (2 under Linux) and 2 SCSI-2 controllers. 
<P>              
I hope this helps others who are struggling with PCI technology use Linux!

<P>My system is configured as follows:  16Mb 60ns RAM, 3Com Etherlink-III 
53C809 ethernet card (using 10base2), ATI Mach 64 2Mb VRAM, Toshiba 2x 
SCSI CDROM, NCR 53c810 PCI SCSI, Syquest 3270 270Mb Cartridge Drive,
Viewsonic 17 monitor, Pentium-90 (FDIV Bug Free).  Running Slackware
2.1.0, Kernel 1.2.0, with other misc patches/upgrades.
<P>Everything is functioning flawlessly.  I dont recommend the Syquest 
drives.  I have used the 3105 and the 3270 and both a very, very
fragile.  Also, the cartridges are easily damaged and I have had
frequent problems with them.  I am in the process of looking for
alternative removable storage (MO, Zip, Minidisc, etc). 
<P>Some information you might need:
<P>
<H3>Flash Bios upgrades </H3>

<P>Flash Bios updates can be ftp'd from
wuarchive.wustl.edu:/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/plato. The current version is
1.00.12.AX1.  The BIOS upgrades *must* be done in order.  1.00.03.AZ1
to 1.00.06.AX1 to 1.00.08.AX1 to 1.00.10.AX1 to 1.00.12.AX1.  The Flash
BIOS updates can also be downloaded from the Intel BBS.  I do not have
that number right now.
<P>
<H3>NCR 53c810 BIOSless PCI SCSI</H3>

<P>If you are using an NCR 53c810 BIOSless PCI SCSI card in the
Plato, you may have trouble getting the card to be recognized.  I had
to change one of the jumpers on the NCR card:  the jumper that
controls whether there is 1 or 2 NCR SCSI cards in your system must be 
set to "2".  I dont know why, but this is how I got it to work.  The
other jumper controls the INT setting (A,B,C,D).  I left mine at A
(the default).
<P>
<H3>apart from that - plug and play!</H3>

<P>There are no settings in the motherboard BIOS for setting the NCR
53c810.  Dont worry - once the card is jumpered correctly, it will be
recognized!  So much for PCI Plug-n-Play!

the IDE-drive: ``on the board there's a
jumper which selects whether IRQ14 comes from the ISA bus or
the PCI bus. The manual has an example where they show
connecting it to PCI INT-A. Well, we did that just like the
example... but then later our IDE drive would not work (the
IDE controller is on board). Had to take it back. The guys
at NCA were puzzled, then traced it back to this jumper. I
guess the IDE controller uses IRQ14 or something? That's not
documented anywhere in the manual. Other than that, seems to
be kicking ass nicely now. Running X, modeming, etc. (for the
Supra you have to explicitly tell the kernel that the COM port
has a 16550A using setserial (in Slackware /etc/rc.d/rc.serial))''.
