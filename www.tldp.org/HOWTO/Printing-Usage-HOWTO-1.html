This document describes how to use the line printer spooling system provided
with the Linux operating system.  This HOWTO is the supplementary document
to the Linux Printing Setup HOWTO, which discusses the installation and
setup of the Linux printing system.  The material presented in this HOWTO
should be equally relevent for all flavors of the BSD operating system in
addition to the Linux operating system.

<P>Note from Mark Komarinski &lt;markk@auratek.com&gt;:
<P>I'd like to thank Matt Foster for doing a lot of work in the re-write
of this HOWTO.  I'm keeping his style, and adding when necessary to keep
everything updated.
<P>Note from Matt Foster &lt;mwf@engr.uark.edu&gt;:
<P>This version of the Linux Printing HOWTO is a complete rewrite of the one
originally written by Grant Taylor &lt;grant@god.tufts.edu&gt; and Brian
McCauley &lt;B.A.McCauley@bham.ac.uk&gt;.  I have tried to keep with the
coverage of material presented by Grant and Brian's HOWTO, but I have
drastically modified the style of presentation and the depth of material
covered.  I feel that this makes the HOWTO more complete and easier to
read.  I can only hope that you agree.
