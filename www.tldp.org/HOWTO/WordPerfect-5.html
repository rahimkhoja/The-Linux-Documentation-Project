<H2><A NAME="s5">5. WordPerfect 5.1 and 6.0 (SCO release)</A></H2>

<P>I started using WP 5.1 for SCO (which was statically linked) since January,
1995. In the Spring, 1995, I obtained a copy of WP 6.0 for SCO 
(dynamic linked) and was able to install it with some
pain. I subsequently have had some problems with the license manager. I have it
running under 1.2.8. 
<P>This section is mainly from the original WordPerfect mini-howto.  It has
not been used in a long time.  Note, the more recent versions of WP for 
SCO included both the dynamic and static linked versions, and hence
did NOT require SCO's shared libraries.  
<P><B>This is mainly for background information!  If you really want 
WP for Linux, get the new WP 7.0!</B>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Impressions of WP/SCO</A>
</H2>

<P>WP for SCO seemed to work fine (once the installation problems were overcome).
I used this distribution for about 6-12 months until I received a copy of
WP 6.0 for Linux (Caldera) and CND 1.0.

</H2>

<P>
<P>
<H3>Requirements</H3>

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Linux 1.1.x to 1.2.x </LI>
<LI> modules (dynamic module loading software) </LI>
<LI> iBCS2 (Intel BCS2 and ELF loader module) </LI>
<LI> SCO dynamic libs (if required) </LI>
<LI> Domainname should be setup </LI>
<LI> Hostname should be setup and be less than 8 characters (localhost is 9) </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Kernel Requirements</H3>

<P>The kernel should be setup for module support and ELF support. If you have already
done this, skip this step, else, do the following as root: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Load kernel in /usr/src/linux.xxx] and make sure that the symbolic link to the
/usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm directories are setup (see
/usr/src/linux/README). 
<LI> Build module support and install it (see below) 
<LI> Build iBCS2 module and install it (see below) 
<LI> Build kernel with module and ELF support (answer Y to BINFMT&thinsp;ELF and
MOD&thinsp;VERSIONS) 
<LI> Reboot on new kernel 
<LI> Note: you have to build the module support file "genksyms" PRIOR to making
your new kernel (telling the kernel to export symbols:
CONFIG&thinsp;MODVERSIONS=y). </LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Modules</H3>

<P>
<P>Loadable module support is required for iBCS2 and hence to run WP 6.0. Get the
latest from the ftp sites, build it, and install it. If you have 
already setup your system for loadable modules, skip this step. 
Loadable module support (/sbin/insmod,
/sbin/rmmod, /sbin/lsmod) is required. With recent kernels, genksyms is also
required. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> File: modules-1.1.87.tar.gz (or latest) </LI>
<LI> Put tar file in /usr/src/modules and build module support </LI>
<LI> Read the README in /usr/src/modules (or wherever you put it) </LI>
<LI> Cd to /usr/src/modules/genksyms and make genksysms, install it in
/usr/local/bin (or /sbin) </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>iBCS2 Emulator</H3>

<P>The iBCS2 emulator allows you to run SCO binaries such as WordPerfect 6.0. Get
the latest from the ftp sites, build it, and install it. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Build and install in /usr/lib/modules </LI>
<LI> Read the HINTS file (/usr/src/ibcs/Doc/HINTS) </LI>
<LI> Make sure that iBCS2 sets up /dev/XOR, if not, create a symbolic link from
/dev/null to /dev/XOR (cd /dev; ln -s /dev/null /dev/XOR) </LI>
</UL>
<P>The interfaces to some subsystems occur at the device layer and thus you need to
create some device files in order to use them: 
<P>
<PRE>

        * /dev/socksys and /dev/nfsd - interface for SVr3 STREAMS based
          TCP/IP applications

          # mknod /dev/socksys c 30 0
          # ln -s /dev/socksys /dev/nfsd

        [WARNING:  the below may already be setup as /dev/inet, 
         /dev/arp, etc., they may have other major/minor numbers,
         if so, skip this step]

        * /dev/inet/{arp,icmp,ip,rip,tcp,udp} - more network hooks

          # mknod /dev/inet/arp c 30 2
          # mknod /dev/inet/icmp c 30 2
          # mknod /dev/inet/ip c 30 2
          # mknod /dev/inet/rip c 30 2
          # mknod /dev/inet/tcp c 30 2
          # mknod /dev/inet/udp c 30 2

        [THIS IS REQUIRED AND WILL USUALLY HAVE TO BE DONE MANUALLY!]
        * /dev/X0R - server side of SVR3 local X interface
          (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

          # ln -s /dev/null /dev/X0R

        * /dev/spx - client side of SVR3 local X interface
          (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

          # mknod /dev/spx c 30 1
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>SCO Shared Libraries</H3>

<P>
<P><B>DO NOT VIOLATE SCO's COPYRIGHTS!</B> You should get a copy of SCO's shared
libraries and install them in /shlib. As root: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> cd /; mkdev /shlib; chmod 755 /shlib </LI>
<LI> if required, make a temporary directory and set TMPDIR to it (export
TMPDIR=/mytmpdir) </LI>
<LI> Copy the following SCO shared libraries from the SCO machine to Linux and
put in /shlib: 
<PRE>
         /shlib/libX11R5_s 
         /shlib/libXtXm* 
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Loading WP60</H3>

<P>
<P>Make sure that you have LOTS of space in your /tmp directory. If you do not have
lots of space, make a tmp directory and set the environment variable TMPDIR to it.
As root first try the following: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Mount the CD (e.g., to /cdrom) </LI>
<LI> cd to the CDROM and run the ./install script </LI>
</UL>
<P>If you get the following error you may not have enough space in your /tmp directory,
make a new tmp directory and set the environment variable TMPDIR (see above): 
<P>
<PRE>
  ERROR:  not enough space in /tmp, or this is an unsupported machine.
</PRE>
<P>If all else fails, you may have to do it manually per these notes: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> get iBCS2 running </LI>
<LI> copy the $WPDIR/cdrom/install.wp to $WPDIR and edit it I changed it so I
could create /tmp/WpTmP on an NFS server (did not have the space locally). I
then ran the program and made changes until I got it to startup.] 
<LI> change to TMPDIR and run: ifiles/cdlink.sco -r /usr/local/wp60/cdrom This
builds links with the proper names but the permissions are not set properly. 
<LI> make a temp directory on the server and copy all files to it: 
<PRE>
        cp -r  WpTmP/wp60/SCO/* wp60 
</PRE>

<LI> change to the temp wp60 directory and changed permissions. cd wp60; chmod
555 wpinstall install/* 
<LI> run the wpinstall program and answered the questions. 
<LI> Because I still have the flexlm license manager for WP51 on the system, I had
to manually run wplicense -e and create a new license.dat. 
<LI> Start WP60.</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>License Manager</H3>

<P>WordPerfect uses a license manager (see the manuals). This is a tricky beast that
sometimes does not work properly under Linux (I have had it fail, done something
else then I was able to start it). If you have problems call WordPerfect and they can
assist you. Please <B>RTFM</B> the documentation section on the license manager. 
<P>
<P>To start the license manager, as root: 
<P>
<PRE>
        # cd $WPDIR/shbin10 
        # ./wplicense -s 
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Starting WP60</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> start iBCS2 </LI>
<LI> start the license manager </LI>
<LI> setup your DISPLAY environment variable (e.g., export DISPLAY=gator:0) </LI>
<LI> run xwp ($WPDIR/wpbin/xwp filename.wpf &amp;) </LI>
</UL>
<P>If you get the errors: 
<P>
<PRE>
  /dev/XOR: No such file or directory
  Error: Can't open display: :0.0
</PRE>
<P>You need to set up your DISPLAY environment variable (per above) and possibly
setup the link to the device /dev/XOR (cd /dev; ln -s /dev/null /dev/XOR). 
<P>Note if WP "steals" the colors from your X server (a problem if the depth is only 256
colors), disable the display of the graphics banner page by doing the following: 
<UL>
<LI> Start XWP </LI>
<LI> From the control window, click on Preferences </LI>
<LI> from the Preferences window, select ENVIRONMENT </LI>
<LI> From the ENVIRONMENT window, turn off the checkbox for "Graphical
Banner and Startup Screen" </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>RC Scripts</H3>

<P>You will need to add a line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local script (or similar) to start iBCS2
and the WP license manager (if desired). 
<P>
<PRE>
        # /sbin/insmod /usr/lib/modules/iBCS &amp; 
        # $WPDIR/shbin10/wplicense -s &amp; 
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Changes to install</H3>

<P>This was extracted from my original notes and includes changes to 
<B>install.wp</B> that are reported to work:
<P>The install.wp on the CDROM did not work out of the box. I had to modify it to get it
to work by moving all files to a temporary directory and changing this install script.
The changes are:

</H2>

<P>I did not keep a detailed list of bugs for WP/SCO, however:
<UL>
<LI>The initial version had install problems.</LI>
<LI>The initial version used SCO shared libraries, hence required a copy of 
them on Linux.</LI>
</UL>
