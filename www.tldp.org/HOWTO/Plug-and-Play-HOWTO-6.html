<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.1">Finding and How-Configured Are Related </A>
</H2>

<P>Once you find your hardware, the same program that found it usually
tells you how it's configured.  So finding out how it's configured is
usually the same procedure as finding the hardware.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.2">Devices May Have Two "Configurations" </A>
</H2>

<P> Here "configuration" means the assignment of PnP bus-resources
(addresses, IRQs, and DMAs).  For each device, there are two parts to
the configuration question:
<OL>
<LI> What does the driver think the hardware configuration is? </LI>
<LI> What configuration (if any) is actually set in the device
hardware? </LI>
</OL>

Each part should have the same answer (the same configuration).  The
configuration of the device hardware and its driver should obviously
be the same (and usually is).  But if things are not working right, it
could be because there's a difference.  This means that the driver has
incorrect information about the actual configuration of the hardware.
This spells trouble.  If the software you use doesn't adequately tell
you what's wrong (or automatically configure it correctly) then you
need to investigate how your hardware devices and their drivers are
configured.  While Linux device drivers should "tell all", in some
cases it may not be easy to determine what has been set in the
hardware.</P>
<P>Another problem is that when you view configuration messages on the
screen you need to know whether the reported configuration is
that of the device driver, the device hardware, or both.  If the
device driver has either set the configuration in the hardware or has
otherwise checked the hardware then the driver should have the correct
information.</P>
<P>But sometimes the driver has been provided incorrect resources by a
script, configuration file, by incorrect resource parameters given to
a module, or perhaps just hasn't been told what the resources are and
tries to use incorrect default resources.  For example, one can uses
"setserial" to tell the serial port driver an incorrect resource
configuration and the driver accepts it without question.  But the
serial port doesn't work right (if at all).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.3">Finding Hardware </A>
</H2>

<P>A common problem is that the software doesn't detect your device
and/or determine the right driver for it.  For PnP devices, detecting
them is easy via PnP software except for the unusual case where the
hardware has been disabled.  The BIOS can sometimes be set to disable
PnP devices or a jumper/switch on the physical device itself could
disable it.  In such a cases, the hardware can't be detected at all
until you either reconfigure the BIOS or change a jumper/switch.</P>
<P>Since the PCI bus is inherently PnP, there are no hidden devices.
Even though PnP devices are easy to find by PnP methods, if the driver
doesn't use PnP methods but uses the old method of probing for them at
likely address, they may not be found.  This is because that, until the
resources are set in a PnP device (by the BIOS or Linux), the device
may have no address at all, so probing at likely address yields
nothing.  For the old ISA bus, some of the devices may be non-PnP and
thus the old probing methods may find them.  So many drivers still
probe at likely address, in addition to using PnP methods (= PnP
probing which is sometimes also just called "probing").</P>

<H2><A NAME="boot_time_msgs"></A> <A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.4">Boot-time Messages </A>
 </H2>

<P>Significant info on the configuration may be obtained by reading
the messages from the BIOS and from Linux that appear on the screen
when you first start the computer.  These messages often flash by too
fast to read but once they stop type Shift-PageUp a few times to
scroll back to them.  To scroll forward thru them type Shift-PageDown.
Typing "dmesg" at any time to the shell prompt will show only the
Linux kernel messages and may miss some of the most important ones
(including ones from the BIOS).  The messages from Linux may sometimes
only show what the device driver thinks the configuration is, perhaps
as told it via an incorrect configuration file.  Checking log files in
/var/log may also be useful.</P>
<P>For the PCI bus, the notation: 00:1a:0 means the PCI bus 00 (the main
PCI bus), PCI card (or chip) 1a, and function 0 (the first device) on
the card or chip.  The 2nd device on the card (or chip) 08 would be:
00:08:1.</P>
<P>The BIOS messages display first and will show the actual hardware
configuration at that time, but isapnp, or pci utilities, or device
drivers may change it later.  In some cases it doesn't show devices
that the BIOS didn't configure.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="pause_"></A> If the BIOS messages don't show as you back up to
the start of the BIOS messages using Shift-PageUp, try freezing them
as they flash by, by hitting the "Pause" key as soon as the first
words flash on the screen.  Press any key to resume.  It's often
tricky to hit Pause exactly at the right time.  Be sure to hold down
the "Shift" key before hitting "Pause" since "Pause" is a shifted key.
If you miss, hit Ctrl-Alt-Del when Linux starts booting to reboot and
try again.  Once the messages from Linux start to appear, it's too
late to use "Pause" since it will not freeze the messages from Linux.</P>
<P>To set things in the BIOS such as IRQs reserved for legacy hardware,
serial port addresses, etc. you need to get into the BIOS (CMOS) setup
menus at boot time.  Each BIOS brand has different keys you need to
hold down to do this.  There are lists on the Internet.  Sometimes by
freezing the BIOS messages or watching the screen, the key you need to
press will be indicated in a message such as "Press DEL for setup".
But it may flash by so fast that you miss it.  Of course, you don't set
stuff in the BIOS that you don't understand, or your PC may become
disabled.</P>
<P>Messages from the BIOS at boot-time tell you how the hardware
configuration was then.  The current configuration may still be the
same since Linux should hopefully accept what the BIOS has done if
it's OK.  Messages from Linux may be from drivers that used kernel PnP
functions to inspect and/or set bus-resources.  These should be
correct, but beware of messages that only show what the driver was
told from a configuration file.  It could be wrong.  Of course, if the
device works fine, then it's likely configured the same as the driver.</P>

<H2><A NAME="proc_dir"></A> <A NAME="ss6.5">6.5</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.5">The /proc Tree</A>
</H2>

<P>Starting with Kernel 2.6, in addition to the /proc directory tree,
there's also a /sys  tree See 
<A HREF="#sys_dir">The /sys Tree</A>.   These trees are useful for finding resource
configurations and devices.  The "files" in them represent data in the
kernel memory and don't exist at all on you harddrive.  Programs such
as lspci get their info from the /proc tree so such programs should
display the results in more readable form than directly inspecting the
"files" in /proc.  Here are 4 /proc "files" that show resources which
have been registered in the kernel by device drivers.</P>
<P>Since Linux's plug-and-play works by letting device drivers allocate
resources for their device, there may be no listing of resources used
by some of your hardware if the driver hasn't yet requested that such
resources be reserved.  For the case of kernel modules (loadable
device drivers), if the module hasn't loaded yet, the kernel doesn't
know about any resources it needs.  Sometimes, the module only loads
when you start an application that needs it.  So if certain hardware
is missing from these "files" in /proc, it may mean that the hardware
hasn't yet been used.  For example, even though your floppy drive has
a floppy disk in it and is ready to use, the interrupt for it will
not show up unless its in use.  </P>
<P>/pts shows I/O addresses.  If there's a mistake (wrong
address) it means trouble since the device will not get bytes sent to
it.<BR>
/proc/iomem shows registered IO memory addresses.<BR>
/proc/interrupts shows the interrupts currently in use.<BR>
/proc/dma shows the dma (Direct Memory Access) ISA dma channel allocations.</P>
<P>In the past, the author observed the listing of interrupts that didn't
exist.  In some cases it showed that a few such interrupts were
actually sent.  This could be due to the issuing of erroneous
interrupts due to hardware defects.</P>
<P>/proc/bus/ has subdirectories (subfolders) input/, pci/, and
isapnp/.  The format of most of the files in this directory is very
cryptic, often just a copy of the bytes in the configuration space.
So, use them only as a last resort.  The input/ subdirectory has
information on input devices such as the keyboard and mouse.  It's not
as cryptic as the other directories under /proc/bus/ and might yield
some useful information about input devices that are PS2 or on the LPC
bus (See 
<A HREF="#lpc_">LPC Bus</A>).  Unfortunately, what I've
seen doesn't say that it's on the LPC bus when it likely is.  In
/pci/00/ there is one binary file for each pci device where the file
names are the pci-slot-numbers (also called pci-slot-names).  The 00
means pci bus 0.</P>

<H2><A NAME="sys_dir"></A> <A NAME="ss6.6">6.6</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.6">The /sys Tree</A>
</H2>

<P>Starting with kernel 2.6 there's a new /sys directory for PnP
configuration.  It's a sysfs type of file system and it's something
like the /proc filesystem since the "files" represent information in
the kernel memory and are not on your harddrive.  But it's not as
useful as the /proc filesystem.  Originally (in the 2.5 kernels) it
was called "driver file system" of type "driverfs".</P>
<P>In the sysfs, each device which exists on your system has it's own
directory which contains files showing the resources allocated to it.
Such device directories have names like 0000:00:12.0@ or 00:06@.  What
devices are these?  The first is a PCI card in "slot" 12 of your PC.
The slot may actually be labeled PCI2 inside your PC (2 instead of
12).  That's because low numbered "slots" are used for built-in
devices on the motherboard that don't use any physical slots.  In this
example, "slots" 1-10 would be built-in and actual slots 11-14 are
labeled 1-4.  By typing "lspci" you'll be able to match the numbers
(like 0000:00:12.0) to names (like IDE interface).  Type "lspci -v"
or "lspci -vv" to see more.</P>
<P>Well then, what is 00:06 ?  It's an ISA card (or built-in device) but
it's not ISA slot 6 (like the PCI numbering).  When a search was made
for ISA-PNP devices, it was the 6th one found.  More precisely, it was
the 7th one found since there's a device numbered: 00:00.  So how does
one identify them?  Well, you could type: "cat */*" and display all
the files for all the devices, but even then you don't see the device
names (but do see info from which you can identify them).  This
inconvenience will hopefully be fixed in the future.</P>
<P>Not only do these files supply information on the bus-resource
configuration (in somewhat cryptic format) and drivers (in "driver"
directories), but in the future, you should be able to use them to
change the resource configuration.  Right now (Aug 2004) you can't
configure the PCI bus with it.  A serious limitation is that per the
present "driver model" you can't change the resource of a device that
has been assigned to a driver which likely means that you'll need to
unload the driver module in order to use it.  If the driver is built
in, there's no hope.  These serious limitations will hopefully be
eliminated in the future.  In the kernel documentation is a file:
"pnp.txt" telling how to configure.  As of Aug. 2004, it was much
out-of-date but the author is working on an update.  Using the /sys
tree to configure resources is known as the "Linux Plug and Play User
Interface".  </P>
<P>The other part of "Linux Plug and Play" is the kernel interface used
by device drivers.  This has changed a lot starting with kernel 2.6
but most drivers are still using the old interface (as of Aug. 2004).
It's possible also for drivers (or you) to use the "user interface"
which needs improvement.</P>

<H2><A NAME="pci_"></A> <A NAME="ss6.7">6.7</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.7">PCI Bus Inspection </A>
 </H2>

<P> It's easy to find out what bus-resources have been assigned to
devices on the PCI bus with the "lspci" and/or "scanpci" commands
The options -v or -vv will show more detail.  In some cases, "scanpci"
will find a device that "lspci" can't find.  That's because "scanpci"
directly searches for devices on the pci bus (via the configuration
space) and doesn't use data obtained by the kernel (where it could be
wrong due to a kernel bug --I've just found such a case).</P>
<P>This info in more cryptic format is found in "files" located in the
<CODE>/sys</CODE> and <CODE>/proc</CODE> trees. In
<CODE>/sys/bus/pci/devices</CODE> the file <CODE>vendor</CODE> will contain the
vendor id number such as 0x4B8C, etc.  In still more cryptic format
it's in <CODE>/proc/bus/pci</CODE>.  Such information in older kernels
prior to kernel 2.6, was in <CODE>/proc/pci</CODE> (non-cryptic but IRQs
in hexadecimal) or in <CODE>/proc/buspci/devices</CODE> (cryptic display). </P>
<P>In most cases for PCI you will only see how the hardware is now
configured and not what resources are required.  In some cases you
only see the base addresses (the starting addresses of the range) but
not the ending addresses.  If you see the entire range then you can
determine how many bytes of address resources are needed. </P>

<H2><A NAME="isa_bus"></A> <A NAME="ss6.8">6.8</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.8">ISA Bus Introduction </A>
 </H2>

<P>For cards on the ISA bus, it's not as simple as for the PCI bus
which is inherently PnP.  Later ISA cards were PnP but older ones were
not.  Also, some cards that are PnP had their PnP disabled by
special software which runs only on MS.  The non PnP cards are
configured by jumpers on the card or by MS software.</P>

<H2><A NAME="isa_pnp"></A> <A NAME="ss6.9">6.9</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.9">ISA PnP cards </A>
 </H2>

<P>If it's a PnP card you may try running <CODE>pnpdump --dumpregs</CODE>
but it's not a sure thing.  The results may be seem cryptic but they
can be deciphered.  Don't confuse the read-port address which
<CODE>pnpdump</CODE> uses for communication with PnP cards with the I/O
address of the found device.  They are not the same.  </P>

<H2><A NAME="lpc_"></A> <A NAME="ss6.10">6.10</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.10">LPC Bus </A>
</H2>

<P>LPC (Low Pin Count) is a bus-like interface often used on laptops
and increasingly used on desktops too.  To find out if you have LPC
type "lspci" and look for "LPC".  There are other words next to "LPC"
such as "ISA Bridge ... LPC Interface Controller" or "LPC Bridge",
etc.  LPC is not really ISA but it substitutes for an ISA bus.</P>
<P>The old ISA bus was slow and devices that needed more speed were put
on the newer PCI but.  But devices that didn't need high speed were
often implemented by chips on the motherboard and remained on the ISA
bus even though there were no slots for any ISA cards.  Then the LPC
bus came along to replace what remained of the ISA bus.  LPC is much
smaller than ISA and just as fast since it runs at 4 times the clock
speed of ISA.  Its multiplexed bus for data/address and control is
only 4 bits wide.  To send a byte requires splitting the byte into 2
half-bytes and then putting them back together.  So its clear why it's
"Low Pin Count" = LPC.  There's also a few other lines in the bus.</P>
<P>This small LPC interface is used for slow "legacy" devices such as
serial ports, parallel ports, and floppy drives.  So a computer using
LPC will have all fast devices on the PCI bus, etc. and slow (legacy)
devices on the LPC bus interface.  All LPC devices will be on-board;
there are no LPC slots.</P>
<P>LPC has no standards for Plug-and-Play configuring but says that the
BIOS or ACPI should do the configuring.  Devices on this bus sometimes
use isapnp.  Linux support for LPC as of late 2004 was very much
incomplete but Linux has some support for the configuring aspects of
ACPI.  Sometimes a BIOS menu lets one manually PnP-configure devices
on the LPC bus but it may not tell you that the device resides on LPC.</P>
<P>A major chip on the LPC bus is the superio chip which contains legacy
IO devices: serial and parallel ports, floppy controller, keyboard
controller, mice, etc.  BIOS data may also reside on the LPC bus.  The
keyboard and mouse (input devices) should be listed in
/proc/bus/input/devices but instead of seeing "lpc" it seems to show
"isa0060/serio0, etc. even though it's on the lpc bus and not the isa
bus.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.11">6.11</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.11">X-bus</A>
</H2>

<P>Before the LPC bus became popular, there was an "X-bus" (not
covered in this HOWTO) which served the same purpose as the LPC bus
but wasn't so compact as LPC.  Some PCs have both LPC and an X-bus.</P>

<H2><A NAME="non_pnp"></A> <A NAME="ss6.12">6.12</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.12">Non-PnP Cards </A>
 </H2>

<P>In contrast to PnP cards, non-PnP cards always have their resources
set in the hardware.  That is they always have an address and IRQ
unless there is a jumper setting, etc. for disabling the device.
Sometimes the resources used can be found by probing done by the
device driver or by other software that does probing.  For example
"scanport" (Debian only ??) probes most IO port address and may find
ISA devices.  But be warned that it might hang your PC.  Sometimes it
will fail to find hardware that's actually there (since the hardware
has the default 0xff in it's registers).  Even if It finds the
hardware it will not show the IRQ nor will it positively identify the
hardware.</P>
<P>So one way to try to find such hardware is to start a driver, which
may probe for such hardware.  By looking at the boot-time messages,
you might see a driver start and find the hardware.  Otherwise, you
may need to find a driver and start it (for example, by having it load
as a module).</P>
<P>Finding the right driver may be difficult.  Sometimes there just isn't
any driver since some devices aren't (yet ?) supported by Linux.  To
determine which driver you need, look at any documentation which might
identify the card.  If this fails, look on the card itself, including
important names/numbers on the chips.  But the identification of the
driver module you need may not be anywhere on the card.  You could
find the FCC id on the card and then search the Internet with the FCC
id number to try to find more information about the card (or the chips
on it).</P>

<H2><A NAME="jumpers_"></A> <A NAME="ss6.13">6.13</A> <A HREF="Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.html#toc6.13">Non-PnP Cards with jumpers </A>
 </H2>

<P>If the card has jumpers to set the resources (configuration) then
one may look at how the jumpers are set.  There are some cards that
had both PnP and jumpers.   They worked like jumper cards if PnP was
somehow disabled.  Sometimes a card has labels on it showing how to
set the jumpers (or at least gives some clue).  You may need the
documentation that came with the card (either printed or on a floppy
disk).  Perhaps you can find it on the Internet.</P>

 </H2>

<P>One the most difficult cases is where software running under MS has
been used to configure either a non-PnP card or a PnP card where PnP
has been disabled by the same MS software.  So you can't configure it
by PnP nor by jumpers.  In this case your only hope is to probe for
addresses as described in 
<A HREF="#non_pnp">Non-PnP Cards</A>.  Or
try to find the MS software that configured it.</P>

developed their own tools for detection and/or configuration of

resource type configuring of Plug-and-Play.  It's configuring in

 </H2>

<P>Some people have attempted to use Windows to see how bus-resources
have been set up.  Unfortunately, since PnP hardware forgets its
bus-resource configuration when powered down, the configuration may
not be the same under Linux.  For non PnP hardware (or where someone
has disabled PnP inside the device by jumpers or Windows software),
then using Windows should work OK.  Even for PnP, it often turns out
to be the same because in many cases both Windows and Linux simply
accept what the BIOS has set.  But where Windows and/or Linux do the
configuring, they may do it differently.  So don't count on PnP
devices being configured the same.</P>
