<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Linux mailing-lists</A></H2>

<P>Used mostly for discussion between developers of new features and testers
of pre-release versions.  See addresses in the FAQ.
Send mail to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the single word
<CODE>help</CODE> in the body of the message , and you will get
mail explaining how to subscribe to the many Linux mailing
lists there.
Save this mail, as it tells you how to unsubscribe from the lists,
and if you post annoying messages to the list complaining
about not being able to get off the list (because you didn't follow
instructions and save the mail telling you how to unsubscribe), you
will likely be flamed for wasting international bandwidth and money.
