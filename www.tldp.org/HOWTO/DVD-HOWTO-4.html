<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Kernel</A>
</H2>

<P>Kernels at least as recent as 2.2.16 or 2.4 series should
already have DVD ioctl support, so you just need to make sure you
have MTRR support enabled in the kernel configuration, and then compile 
and install it as you normally would.
<P> 
If you want to patch your exisiting older kernel, start by going to
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.dk/">http://www.kernel.dk/</A>
and downloading the correct patch for your kernel. 
<P>
<P>If don't know how to install or patch your kernel, you should go read 
the Kernel HOWTO at
<A HREF="http://howto.tucows.com/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">http://howto.tucows.com/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</A><H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 LiViD Utilities</A>
</H2>

<P>To install the LiViD utilities, you need to make sure you have /usr/local/lib
somewhere in /etc/ld.so.conf.
<P>DVD playback only requires OMS to be built.  It builds ac3 and mpeg2 codecs
by itself.  However, feel free to play with the standalone codecs if you
wish.  The following commands should compile and install the LiViD
utilities on your system.  If you have problems, please see the "Problems"
section.
<P>
<PRE>
 
      ac3dec: (optional)
    
        # cd ~/livid/ac3dec
        # ./autogen.sh
        # make
        # make install          
   
      mpeg2dec: (optional)
    
        # cd ~/livid/mpeg2dec
        # ./autogen.sh
        # make
        # make install
        
      oms:
      
        # cd ~/livid/oms
        # ./autogen.sh
        # ./configure
        # make
        # make install
</PRE>
<P>There are some extra options that can be used. They are placed
as arguments to the ./configure script. OMS has --enable-devel which
will enable some development and experimental features in the code.
Standard autoconf parameters such as --prefix can be used if you wish
to install somehwere other than /usr/local.  For instance to install
in a subdir of the source dir you could do:
<PRE>
        # ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst
</PRE>
<P>Run ./configure --help to get a complete listing of options.  If you
install X in an odd location (for instance you have XFree86 3.3.x and 4.x
installed at the same time) you may need the --x-includes and --x-libraries
options.
<P>Now the necessary LiViD utilities should be installed.  The next section is
not required, but if you use the "pipes" plugin, you will need to make some
special fifo pipes for the DVD data to travel over.  These can be made with
the following commands (if they don't already exist):
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
 
        # mkfifo /tmp/video
        # mkfifo /tmp/audio
</PRE>
<P>Another method of controlling the data available in the oms_devel version is to use raw I/O, which is available in the latest linux kernels. If you don't have these, data will be read from the standard device. Using raw I/O is recommended, but not necessary.  If they do not exist, create two devices as follows:
<PRE>
        # mknod /dev/rawctl c 162 0
        # mknod /dev/raw1 c 162 1
</PRE>
<P>     
One last thing to do. OMS needs /dev/dvd to be a symlink to where
your DVD drive resides, such as /dev/hdb1 or /dev/scd0.  If it is at
/dev/cdrom, you would create the link by typing:
<P>
<PRE>
        # ln -s /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd
</PRE>
<P>It is generally a good idea not to make a symlink to a symlink, because it
adds unnecessary I/O.  Replace /dev/cdrom with the 
correct device that your dvd drive is on.
