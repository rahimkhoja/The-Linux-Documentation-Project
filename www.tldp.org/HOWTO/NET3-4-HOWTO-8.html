<P>The following subsections are specific to particular network
technologies.  The information contained in these sections does not
necessarily apply to any other type of network technology. The topics
are sorted alphabetically.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 ARCNet</A>
</H2>

<P>ARCNet device names are `<CODE>arc0e</CODE>', `<CODE>arc1e</CODE>', `<CODE>arc2e</CODE>' etc. or
`<CODE>arc0s</CODE>', `<CODE>arc1s</CODE>', `<CODE>arc2s</CODE>' etc. The first card detected by the
kernel is assigned `<CODE>arc0e</CODE>' or `<CODE>arc0s</CODE>' and the rest are assigned
sequentially in the order they are detected. The letter at the end signifies
whether you've selected ethernet encapsulation packet format or RFC1051 packet
format.

<P>Once you have your kernel properly built to support your ethernet card then
configuration of the card is easy.
<P>Typically you would use something like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# ifconfig arc0e 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
        root# route add -net 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 arc0e

Please refer to the
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/arcnet.txt</CODE> and

for further information.
<P>ARCNet support was developed by Avery Pennarun, <CODE>apenwarr@foxnet.net</CODE>.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Appletalk (<CODE>AF_APPLETALK</CODE>)</A>

<P>The Appletalk support has no special device names as it uses existing network
devices.

            &lt;*> Appletalk DDP
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Appletalk support allows your Linux machine to interwork with Apple networks.
An important use for this is to share resources such as printers and disks
between both your Linux and Apple computers. Additional software is required,
this is called <EM>netatalk</EM>. Wesley Craig <CODE>netatalk@umich.edu</CODE> represents
a team called the `Research Systems Unix Group' at the University of Michigan
and they have produced the <EM>netatalk</EM> package which provides software that
implements the Appletalk protocol stack and some useful utilities.
The <EM>netatalk</EM> package will either have been supplied with your Linux
distribution, or you will have to ftp it from its home site at the
<A HREF="ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/unix/netatalk/">University of Michigan</A><P>To build and install the package do something like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        user% tar xvfz .../netatalk-1.4b2.tar.Z
        user% make
        root# make install
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You may want to edit the `Makefile' before calling <EM>make</EM> to
actually compile the software. Specifically, you might want to change
the DESTDIR variable which defines where the files will be installed
later.  The default of /usr/local/atalk is fairly safe.
<H3>Configuring the Appletalk software.</H3>

<P>The first thing you need to do to make it all work is to ensure that the
appropriate entries in the <CODE>/etc/services</CODE> file are present. The
entries you need are:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  rtmp  1/ddp   # Routing Table Maintenance Protocol
  nbp   2/ddp   # Name Binding Protocol
  echo  4/ddp   # AppleTalk Echo Protocol
  zip   6/ddp   # Zone Information Protocol
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The next step is to create the Appletalk configuration files in the
<CODE>/usr/local/atalk/etc</CODE> directory (or wherever you installed the
package).
<P>The first file to create is the <CODE>/usr/local/atalk/etc/atalkd.conf</CODE> file.
Initially this file needs only one line that gives the name of the network
device that supports the network that your Apple machines are on:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  eth0
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The Appletalk daemon program will add extra details after it is run.
<H3>Exporting a Linux filesystems via Appletalk.</H3>

<P>You can export filesystems from your linux machine to the network so that
Apple machine on the network can share them.
<P>To do this you must configure the
<CODE>/usr/local/atalk/etc/AppleVolumes.system</CODE> file. There is another
configuration file called <CODE>/usr/local/atalk/etc/AppleVolumes.default</CODE>
which has exactly the same format and describes which filesystems users
connecting with guest privileges will receive.
<P>Full details on how to configure these files and what the various options are
can be found in the <EM>afpd</EM> man page.
<P>A simple example might look like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  /tmp Scratch
  /home/ftp/pub "Public Area"
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Which would export your <CODE>/tmp</CODE> filesystem as AppleShare Volume
`Scratch' and your ftp public directory as AppleShare Volume `Public Area'.
The volume names are not mandatory, the daemon will choose some for you,
but it won't hurt to specify them anyway.
<H3>Sharing your Linux printer across Appletalk.</H3>

<P>You can share your linux printer with your Apple machines quite simply.
You need to run the <EM>papd</EM> program which is the Appletalk
Printer Access Protocol Daemon. When you run this program it will accept
requests from your Apple machines and spool the print job to your local
line printer daemon for printing.
<P>You need to edit the <CODE>/usr/local/atalk/etc/papd.conf</CODE> file to configure
the daemon. The syntax of this file is the same as that of your usual
<CODE>/etc/printcap</CODE> file. The name you give to the definition is
registered with the Appletalk naming protocol, NBP.
<P>A sample configuration might look like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  TricWriter:\
     :pr=lp:op=cg:
  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Which would make a printer named `TricWriter' available to your Appletalk
network and all accepted jobs would be printed to the linux printer `<CODE>lp</CODE>'
(as defined in the <CODE>/etc/printcap</CODE> file) using <EM>lpd</EM>. The entry
`<CODE>op=cg</CODE>' says that the linux user `<CODE>cg</CODE>' is the operator of the printer.
<H3>Starting the appletalk software.</H3>

<P>Ok, you should now be ready to test this basic configuration. There is an
<EM>rc.atalk</EM> file supplied with the <EM>netatalk</EM> package that should
work ok for you, so all you should have to do is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        root# /usr/local/atalk/etc/rc.atalk
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and all should startup and run ok. You should see no error messages and
the software will send messages to the console indicating each stage as it
starts.
<H3>Testing the appletalk software.</H3>

<P>To test that the software is functioning properly, go to one of your Apple
machines, pull down the Apple menu, select the Chooser, click on AppleShare,
and your Linux box should appear.
<H3>Caveats of the appletalk software.</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>You may need to start the Appletalk support before you
configure your IP network. If you have problems
starting the Appletalk programs, or if after you start
them you have trouble with your IP network, then try
starting the Appletalk software before you run your
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</CODE> file.
</LI>
<LI>The <EM>afpd</EM> (Apple Filing Protocol Daemon)
severely messes up your hard disk. Below the mount
points it creates a couple of directories called
``<CODE>.AppleDesktop</CODE>'' and <CODE>Network Trash
Folder</CODE>. Then, for each directory you access it
will create a <CODE>.AppleDouble</CODE> below it so it can
store resource forks, etc. So think twice before
exporting <CODE>/</CODE>, you will have a great time
cleaning up afterwards.
</LI>
<LI>The <EM>afpd</EM> program expects clear text passwords
from the Macs.  Security could be a problem, so be
very careful when you run this daemon on a machine
connected to the Internet, you have yourself to blame
if somebody nasty does something bad.
</LI>
<LI>The existing diagnostic tools such as <EM>netstat</EM>
and <EM>ifconfig</EM> don't support Appletalk. The raw
information is available in the <CODE>/proc/net/</CODE>
directory if you need it.
</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 FDDI</A>
</H2>

<P>FDDI device names are `<CODE>fddi0</CODE>', `<CODE>fddi1</CODE>', `<CODE>fddi2</CODE>' etc. The first
card detected by the kernel is assigned `<CODE>fddi0</CODE>' and the rest are assigned
sequentially in the order they are detected.

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>When you have your kernel built to support the FDDI driver and installed,
configuration of the FDDI interface is almost identical to that of an ethernet
interface. You just specify the appropriate FDDI interface name in the
<EM>ifconfig</EM> and <EM>route</EM> commands.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 Frame Relay</A>
</H2>

<P>The Frame Relay device names are `<CODE>dlci00</CODE>', `<CODE>dlci01</CODE>' etc for the
DLCI encapsulation devices and `<CODE>sdla0</CODE>', `<CODE>sdla1</CODE>' etc for the FRAD(s).
<P>Frame Relay is a new networking technology that is designed to suit data
communications traffic that is of a `bursty' or intermittent nature. You
connect to a Frame Relay network using a Frame Relay Access Device (FRAD).
The Linux Frame Relay supports IP over Frame Relay as described in RFC-1490.

<P>Mike McLagan, <CODE>mike.mclagan@linux.org</CODE>, developed the Frame Relay support
and configuration tools.
<P>Currently the only FRAD supported are the
<A HREF="http://www.sangoma.com/">Sangoma Technologies</A>
<CODE>S502A</CODE>, <CODE>S502E</CODE> and <CODE>S508</CODE>.
<P>To configure the FRAD and DLCI devices after you have rebuilt your kernel
you will need the Frame Relay configuration tools. These are available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.invlogic.com/pub/linux/fr/frad-0.15.tgz">ftp.invlogic.com</A>.
Compiling and installing the tools is straightforward, but the lack of a
top level Makefile makes it a fairly manual process:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        user% tar xvfz .../frad-0.15.tgz
        user% cd frad-0.15
        user% for i in common dlci frad; make -C $i clean; make -C $i; done
        root# mkdir /etc/frad
        root# install -m 644 -o root -g root bin/*.sfm /etc/frad
        root# install -m 700 -o root -g root frad/fradcfg /sbin
        rppt# install -m 700 -o root -g root dlci/dlcicfg /sbin
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note that the previous commands use <EM>sh</EM> syntax, if you use a
<EM>csh</EM> flavour instead (like <EM>tcsh</EM>), the <EM>for</EM> loop will look
different.
<P>After installing the tools you need to create an
<CODE>/etc/frad/router.conf</CODE> file. You can use this template, which
is a modified version of one of the example files:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /etc/frad/router.conf

<P>When you've built your <CODE>/etc/frad/router.conf</CODE> file the only
step remaining is to configure the actual devices themselves. This is
only a little trickier than a normal network device configuration, you
need to remember to bring up the FRAD device before the DLCI

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The AX25, Netrom and Rose protocols are covered by the
<A HREF="AX25-HOWTO.html">AX25-HOWTO</A>.
These protocols are used by Amateur Radio Operators world wide in packet
radio experimentation.
<P>Most of the work for implementation of these protocols has been done by
Jonathon Naylor, <CODE>jsn@cs.nott.ac.uk</CODE>.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.11">8.11 SAMBA - `NetBEUI', `NetBios', `CIFS' support.</A>
</H2>

<P>SAMBA is an implementation of the Session Management Block protocol. Samba
allows Microsoft and other systems to mount and use your disks and printers.
<P>SAMBA and its configuration are covered in detail in the
<A HREF="SMB-HOWTO.html">SMB-HOWTO</A>.

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>STRIP is a protocol designed specifically for a range of Metricom
radio modems for a research project being conducted by Stanford
University called the 
<A HREF="http://mosquitonet.Stanford.EDU/mosquitonet.html">MosquitoNet Project</A>.  There is a lot of interesting reading
here, even if you aren't directly interested in the project.
<P>The Metricom radios connect to a serial port, employ spread spectrum
technology and are typically capable of about 100kbps.
Information on the Metricom radios is available from the:
<A HREF="http://www.metricom.com/">Metricom Web Server</A>.
<P>At present the standard network tools and utilities do not support the
STRIP driver, so you will have to download some customized tools from the
MosquitoNet web server. Details on what software you need is available at the:
<A HREF="http://mosquitonet.Stanford.EDU/strip.html">MosquitoNet STRIP Page</A>.
<P>A summary of configuration is that you use a modified <EM>slattach</EM> program
to set the line discipline of a serial tty device to STRIP and then configure
the resulting `<CODE>st[0-9]</CODE>' device as you would for ethernet with one
important exception, for technical reasons STRIP does not support the ARP
protocol, so you must manually configure the ARP entries for each of the hosts
on your subnet. This shouldn't prove too onerous.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.13">8.13 Token Ring</A>
</H2>

<P>Token ring device names are `<CODE>tr0</CODE>', `<CODE>tr1</CODE>' etc. Token Ring is an
IBM standard LAN protocol that avoids collisions by providing a mechanism
that allows only one station on the LAN the right to transmit at a time.
A `token' is held by one station at a time and the station holding the
token is the only station allowed to transmit. When it has transmitted
its data it passes the token onto the next station. The token loops amongst
all active stations, hence the name `Token Ring'.

Configuration of token ring is identical to that of ethernet with the exception
of the network device name to configure.
<H2><A NAME="ss8.14">8.14 X.25</A>
</H2>

<P>X.25 is a circuit based packet switching protocol defined by the
<CODE>C.C.I.T.T.</CODE> (a standards body recognized by Telecommunications companies
in most parts of the world). An implementation of X.25 and LAPB are being
worked on and recent <CODE>2.1.*</CODE> kernels include the work in progress.
<P>Jonathon Naylor <CODE>jsn@cs.nott.ac.uk</CODE> is leading the development and
a mailing list has been established to discuss Linux X.25 related matters.
To subscribe send a message to: <CODE>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</CODE> with the
text "<CODE>subscribe linux-x25</CODE>" in the body of the message.
<P>Early versions of the configuration tools may be obtained from Jonathon's ftp

The WaveLAN card is a spread spectrum wireless lan card. The card looks
very like an ethernet card in practice and is configured in much the same
way.
