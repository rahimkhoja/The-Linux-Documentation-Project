<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc1.1">Preamble </A>
</H2>


<P>Linux Quake sits at the crossroads of two computing revolutions; GNU/Linux -
the popular free operating system, and GLQuake - the first "first person
shooter" to use OpenGL.
Thanks to John Carmack releasing the software under the GPL we are able to
enjoy it on non-proprietary platforms.
And, despite it's age, great new maps are still regularly released.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc1.2">About </A>
</H2>


<P>This document is a guide to installing Quake and it's many related games and
modifications.  It includes compilation notes, tips and pointers to the best
web resources, as well as some information about Quake II, III and IV.   
You'll also find many issues relevant to
Linux gaming in general.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc1.3">Notation </A>
</H2>


<P>In some places, a shorthand is used to represent changes to a program's source code.
This is of the form:
<PRE>
- code to be removed
+ code to be inserted in its place
</PRE>

and is similar to the output of the GNU "diff" program when generating unified patches.</P>
<P>Where the term "$PWD" is used, the user should  
already have executed the command <B>cd {Linux Quake directory}</B>, and have this as their
current directory.</P>
