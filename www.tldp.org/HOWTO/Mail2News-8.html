<P>One problem with messages posted this way is they'll have a
Newsgroups: header in them, and some other junk that the newsserver
introduces.  This isn't a major problem, but it makes the messages
"messy".  It'd be nice if some program could intercept them and
re-write the headers before sending them on.
