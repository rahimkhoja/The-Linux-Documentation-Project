<EM>This document describes how to setup the ax25-utilities package for
Amateur Radio such that it makes Netrom Nodes for the Node program
and the BBS software from John-Paul Roubelat, F6FBB. The DOS G8BPQ
Switch makes a bbs node and many features, it was expected that the
Linux ax25-utils would have a similar capability. This was not the
case. Help came from John Ackerman, N8UR who put a message on the
Linux-Ham SIG that he had done the BBS node and the info was on his
web site! When the information was tried it didn't work properly but
much was learned about the technique. Help from Tomi Manninen, OH2BNS
did the trick. Nodes for the BBS and the Node and the DX Cluster were
made and work fine.</EM>
