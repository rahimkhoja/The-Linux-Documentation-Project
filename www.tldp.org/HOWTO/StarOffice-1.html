<P>This document deals with installing StarOffice 3.1. The current version
of StarOffice is 5.1. Version 5.1 is considerably easier to install and less
buggy than version 3.1. In fact, in my opinion there is no need for a HOWTO
for version 5.1, since StarDivision has written a fairly complete
installation guide. The StarOffice mini-HOWTO was useful while it lasted,
but it is now being archived only for the few who still wish to install
StarOffice 3.1. For information about StarOffice 5.1, check StarDivision's site at <CODE>

<P>The StarOffice Office Suite is a collection of office tools for Linux,
written in C using the Motif toolkit. 
<P>StarOffice includes:
<UL>
<LI> StarWriter, a word processor</LI>
<LI> StarCalc, a spreadsheet</LI>
<LI> StarImage, an image editor</LI>
<LI> StarDraw, a draw program similar to Corel DRAW</LI>
<LI> StarChart, a chart-making program</LI>
<LI> StarMath, a math editor</LI>
</UL>
<P>The StarOffice Office Suite for Linux is free for non-commercial use. 
Commercial use requires a license. The cost for a commercial license
seperate from Caldera's OpenLinux system is currently undecided.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Motif info</A>
</H2>

<P>StarOffice is written using the commercial Motif 2.0 GUI 
toolkit. The dynamically linked version will *not* work with Motif 
1.2/LessTif.
<P>The static version (with Motif 2.0 linked in) will work regardless 
of whether or not you have Motif. However, performance drops.
<P>I run StarOffice on a Pentium 100 with 48 megs RAM, 
running Redhat 4.1 and Motif 2.0. Dynamically linked 
StarOffice takes about a minute to load. However, it is noticable 
that, once it loads up, StarOffice dynamically linked takes up 
much less resources than the static version.
