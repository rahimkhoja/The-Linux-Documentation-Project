<P>BIOS - Any bios that allows automatic identification of disk drive
geometry and allows you to select the sequence of devices to boot from
should work.  I successfully built systems based on both PhoenixBIOS
4.0 and AMI Plug and Play Flash BIOS.
<P>
<P>DISKS - One fixed internal disk dedicated to Linux. (first disk)
One Removable drive enclosure, with any number of drives. (second disk)
<P>
<P>Since a lot of this HOWTO has to do with disks, from now on I will
generally use the terms "first disk" and "second disk".  The first disk is the
one initially accessed when the machine is turned on, commonly known as the
boot disk.  It has LILO installed in the MBR and is dedicated to a single
operating system, specifically Linux.  The second disk is a removable disk
that contains one or more alternative operating systems which may or may not
have a boot loader in the MBR or elsewhere.
<P>
<P>There are no other hardware/firmware requirements.  Any other
requirements would be dictated by the specific O/S.  For instance, even
though you could install it, Solaris 7 is not going to run well on an
old 90MHz machine!  The configuration and methodology described here
should however work equally well regardless of the CPU speed or other
installed peripherals.
<P>
<P>Operating Systems - I have tested this process with Linux (Redhat
and Suse), Solaris 7, BeOS, Win 98 and even MSDOS 6.22. I see no reason
why it wouldn't work with Win 95, O/S 2, or FreeBSD.  I am not familiar
with Windows NT or 2000 so I don't know how they would react to this
kind of setup.
<P>
<P>Boot loader - I used LILO on the first disk and BeOS bootman on the
second disks.  I used LILO on the first disk because it was the only
boot loader that allowed me to select the MBR on the second disk as an
acceptable boot partition.  Any relatively robust boot loader should
work on the second disk.
