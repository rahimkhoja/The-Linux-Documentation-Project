>3. RPM packages</H1
><P
>    The major part of the Red Hat distribution consists of a set of RPM (Redhat
    Package Manager) files.  An RPM package typically contains binary
    executables, along with relevant configuration files and documentation.
    The <A
HREF="http://www.rpm.org"
TARGET="_top"
>rpm</A
> program is a powerful
    package manager, which can be used to install, query, verify, update, erase
    and build software packages in the RPM format. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Rpm</TT
> 
    convieniently maintains a database of all the software packages it has 
    installed, so information on the installed software is available at any time.
  </P
><P
>    The binary RPM files in the distribution have been built on a system
    running the distribution itself. This is important, because most of the
    programs in the packages rely on shared libraries. From RedHat version 5.0,
    the new version 2 of the GNU standard C library (which is 64-bit clean) has
    been used. This version of the library is commonly referred to as
    <EM
>glibc</EM
> or in Linux: <EM
>libc 6</EM
>. All 
    executables in the distribution have been linked against this library. 
    If you attempt to install binary files from a different distribution, 
    chances are that they will not work, unless you install the libc5 package 
    for backwards compability. There are also incompatibilities between the 
    various version of the Redhat Package Manager itself which will make the 
    installation of some packages fail even on machines they are supposed to 
    (and they would probably) run on. 
  </P
><P
>    The names of the RPM packages contain the suffix <EM
>.arch.rpm</EM
>, 
    where <EM
>arch</EM
> is the architecture, usually having the value 
    <EM
>i386</EM
> for Intel platform binaries.  The packages you install 
    must match the versions of the shared libraries available on the machine. The 
    <A
HREF="http://www.rpm.org"
TARGET="_top"
>rpm</A
> program is usually quite good at
    ensuring that this is indeed the case, however, there are ways around this
    check, and you should be sure that you know what you are doing if you force
    installation of packages this way.  However, using the RedHat installation
    boot disk, it is ensured that the correct set of RPM packages are installed
    on the machine.
  </P
><P
>    If you discover a RPM package that was not installed on your system during
    the installation process, don't despair. At any time, you may (as root)
    install RPM packages, for example:

>    Another version of the RPM packages contains the original sources 
    used to build the binaries. These packages have the suffix 
    <EM
>.src.rpm</EM
> and are situated in the 
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>SRPMS</TT
> directory. These packages compose 
    the last two CDs and part of the third one out of the five which compose the 8.0 (or 
    7.3) release. For release 9 they are on three separate CDs. For 6.2 (and previous, 
    not too old, versions), things change a bit because there is only one installation CD 
    not comprising the SRPMS packages, which you can burn on a different disc, if you want.

>    To obtain more informations on the Redhat package manager, I suggest you to read 
    the man pages and the fairly detailed book <A

>    maximum rpm</A
>. 
  </P
><P
>    In the next section, I will introduce a C program which will be used in various 
    scripts throughout the rest of the howto. It just returns, given two versions of 
    the same RPM package, which one is newer. This program is based on the code 
    used in the Redhat Package Manager (release 4.1) and is used when the 
    <EM
>--freshen</EM
> option is given.
