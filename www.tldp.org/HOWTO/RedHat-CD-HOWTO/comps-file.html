          The RedHat Linux Customization Guide</A

          completely the installation of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Base"</SPAN
> group, because there are 
          too many packages I usually need, so I just unselected the default installation 
          for these packages making them optional. As you can see, even the 
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>redhat-logos</TT
> package in the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Core"</SPAN
> group was made 
          optional. Considering that all of the packages in this group, together,  should 
          represent the <EM
>smallest possible</EM
> installation, you probably 
          don't want to do this (by the way my CDs work even with this, there should be 
          some failure I cannot see, yet). The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tripwire</TT
> package was 
          also added to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Base"</SPAN
> group. The last noticeable modification 
          was made to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dialup"</SPAN
> group, which will be installed even if 
          unselected because the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Base"</SPAN
> group depends on it (as declared in 
          the group definition itself). I have selected only some packages I usually need 
          from this group for installation and left the rest of them unselected.
