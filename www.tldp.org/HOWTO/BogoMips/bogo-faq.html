>Quoted from the Internet, origin unknown but brought to the
attention by Eric S Raymond, <EM
>esr@thyrsus.com</EM
>,
and Geoff Mackenzie, <EM
>freon@dialstart.net</EM
>, there
is an humourously illustrative definition of BogoMips as ''the
number of million times per second a processor can do absolutely
nothing.''</P
><P
>On a more precise basis, from mail from Lars Wirzenius,
<EM
>wirzeniu@kruuna.Helsinki.FI</EM
>, dated 9 September
1993, explaining BogoMips, with additional detailed information by
Alessandro Rubini, <EM

>`MIPS is short for Millions of Instructions
Per Second.  It is a measure for the computation speed of a program.
Like most such measures, it is more often abused than used properly
(it is very difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds
of computers).</P
><P
>BogoMips are Linus's own invention. The linux kernel version
0.99.11 (dated 11 July 1993) needed a timing loop (the time is
too short and/or needs to be too exact for a non-busy-loop method
of waiting), which must be calibrated to the processor speed of the
machine. Hence, the kernel measures at boot time how fast a certain
kind of busy loop runs on a computer. "Bogo" comes from "bogus",
i.e, something which is a fake. Hence, the BogoMips value gives some
indication of the processor speed, but it is way too unscientific to
be called anything but BogoMips.</P
><P
>The reasons (there are two) it is printed during boot-up is
that a) it is slightly useful for debugging and for checking that
the computers caches and turbo button work, and b) Linus loves to
chuckle when he sees confused people on the 
news.'</P

referred to as BogoBoost software. Cyrix 5x86 and 6x86 CPUs may
have their BogoMips improved drastically by branch-prediction (BIOS

are several packages available for adjusting Cyrix CPUs, such as the
BogoBoost patch, cx5x86mod, and set6x86, all from the normal archives,
in obvious places. It is reported the Cyrix 6x86 CPUs may give
better performance when the kernel is compiled with 486-optimization,
instead Pentium-optimization.</P
