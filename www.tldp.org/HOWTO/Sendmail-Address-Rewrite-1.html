<P>We assume that you have the kind of Internet access
which seems to be most common at universities and online
services nowadays: You dial into your provider's network
using PPP over a serial connection. Your incoming mail is
spooled at the provider's POP or IMAP server, while
outgoing messages are to be sent via SMTP.  You don't have
a domain name of your own, so everything has to use
<EM>one</EM> address.
<P>
<P>We assume that you have already installed a fairly
recent version of Eric Allman's sendmail (version 8.8.8 is
current at the time of this writing and should work fine).
<P>
<P>This document is partially referring to specific
properties of Debian GNU/Linux systems; users of different
distributions will have to take some care.
<P>
<P>Make sure you have the following information at hand:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Your ISP's mail server</LI>
<LI>Your Internet mail address</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>The configuration we are planning has two main goals:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Sending mail between various local users must be
possible.</LI>
<LI>The outside world must see the local users'
ISP mail addresses, not the local ones.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>To achieve this, we will make use of sendmail's
<CODE>genericstable</CODE> feature.
