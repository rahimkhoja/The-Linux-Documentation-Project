</H2>

<P>Everybody who wants to install a web server database but does not
know which software is necessary and how it is installed should
benefit from reading this text. This text provides all information
necessary to get a SQL database for a web server going; it does
<EM>not</EM> go into any detail of CGI programming, nor does it explain
the SQL database language. Excellent books are available on both
topics, and it is the intention of this text to provide a working
platform based on which a user can then study CGI programming and
SQL.
<P>For getting a small scale SQL system running (not the notorious
example of a major airline booking system, or space mission management
database) it will be sufficient to have the software described in
this text and the documentation accompanying it. The user manual
of msql (a database introduced in this text) provides sufficient
information on SQL for building your own database.
<P>The reader of this text should have a working knowledge of how
to obtain files via <CODE>ftp</CODE> if he has no access to CD-ROMs, and
a basic understanding of how to build binaries from sources. Anyway,
all steps explained in this text were tested on a real life system
and should also work on the reader's system.
