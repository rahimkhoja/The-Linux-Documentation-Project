If you have several operating systems on your disks, then each
uses one or more disk partitions.  A disagreement on where these
partitions are may have catastrophic consequences.
<P>
<A NAME="partitiontable"></A> 
The MBR contains a <I>partition table</I> describing where the
(primary) partitions are.  There are 4 table entries, for 4
primary partitions, and each looks like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
struct partition {
        char active;    /* 0x80: bootable, 0: not bootable */
        char begin[3];  /* CHS for first sector */
        char type;
        char end[3];    /* CHS for last sector */
        int start;      /* 32 bit sector number (counting from 0) */
        int length;     /* 32 bit number of sectors */
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(where CHS stands for Cylinder/Head/Sector).
<P>This information is redundant: the location of a partition
is given both by the 24-bit <CODE>begin</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> fields,
and by the 32-bit <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> fields.
<P>Linux only uses the <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> fields, and can
therefore handle partitions of not more than 2^32 sectors,
that is, partitions of at most 2 TiB.  That is twelve times
larger than the disks available today, so maybe it will be
enough for the next five years or so.
(So, partitions can be very large, but there is a serious
restriction in that a file in an ext2 filesystem on hardware
with 32-bit integers cannot be larger than 2 GiB.)
<P>DOS uses the <CODE>begin</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> fields, and uses the
BIOS INT13 call to access the disk, and can therefore only
handle disks of not more than 8.4 GB, even with a translating
BIOS. (Partitions cannot be larger than 2.1 GB because of
restrictions of the FAT16 file system.) The same holds for
Windows 3.11 and WfWG and Windows NT 3.*.
<P>Windows 95 has support for the Extended INT13 interface, and
uses special partition types (c, e, f instead of b, 6, 5)
to indicate that a partition should be accessed in this way.
When these partition types are used, the <CODE>begin</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE> fields
contain dummy information (1023/255/63).
Windows 95 OSR2 introduces the FAT32 file system (partition type
b or c), that allows partitions of size at most 2 TiB.
<P>What is this nonsense you get from <CODE>fdisk</CODE> about `overlapping'
partitions, when in fact nothing is wrong?
Well - there is something `wrong': if you look at the <CODE>begin</CODE>
and <CODE>end</CODE> fields of such partitions, as DOS does, they overlap.
(And that cannot be corrected, because these fields cannot store
cylinder numbers above 1024 - there will always be `overlap'
as soon as you have more than 1024 cylinders.)
However, if you look at the <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>length</CODE> fields,
as Linux does, and as Windows 95 does in the case of partitions
with partition type c, e or f, then all is well.
So, ignore these warnings when <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> is satisfied and you
have a Linux-only disk. Be careful when the disk is shared with DOS.
Use the commands <CODE>cfdisk -Ps /dev/hdx</CODE> and <CODE>cfdisk -Pt /dev/hdx</CODE>
to look at the partition table of <CODE>/dev/hdx</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 The last cylinder</A>
</H2>

<P>Many old IBM PS/2 systems used disks with a defect map written
to the end of the disk. (Bit 0x20 in the control word of the
<A HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hdtypes/hdtypes-2.html">disk parameter table</A> is set.)
Therefore, FDISK would not use the last cylinder. Just to be sure, the BIOS
often already reports the size of the disk as one cylinder smaller than
reality, and that may mean that two cylinders are lost.
Newer BIOSes have several disk size reporting functions, where internally
one calls the other. When both subtract 1 for this reserved cylinder and
also FDISK does so, then one may lose three cylinders.
These days all of this is irrelevant, but this may provide an explanation
if one observes that different utilities have slightly different opinions
about the disk size.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Cylinder boundaries</A>
</H2>

<P>A well-known claim says that partitions should start and end
at cylinder boundaries.
<P>Since "disk geometry" is something without objective existence,
different operating systems will invent different geometries
for the same disk. One often sees a translated geometry like */255/63
used by one and an untranslated geometry like */16/63 used by another OS.
(People tell me Windows NT uses */64/32 while Windows 2K uses */255/63.)
Thus, it may be impossible to align partitions to cylinder boundaries
according to each of the the various ideas about the size of a cylinder
that one's systems have. Also different Linux kernels may assign
different geometries to the same disk.
Also, enabling or disabling the BIOS of a SCSI card may change the
fake geometry of the connected SCSI disks.
<P>Fortunately, for Linux there is no alignment requirement at all.
(Except that some semi-broken installation software likes to be very sure
that all is OK; thus, it may be impossible to install RedHat 7.1
on a disk with unaligned partitions because DiskDruid is unhappy.)
<P>People report that it is easy to create nonaligned partitions
in Windows NT, without any noticeable bad effects.
<P>But MSDOS 6.22 has an alignment requirement. Extended partition sectors
that are not on a cylinder boundary are ignored by its FDISK.
The system itself is happy with any alignment, but interprets
relative starting addresses as if relative to an aligned address:
The starting address of a logical partition is given relative not
to the address of the extended partition sector that describes it,
but relative to the start of the cylinder that contains that sector.
(So, it is not surprising that also PartitionMagic requires alignment.)
<P>What is the definition of alignment?
MSDOS 6.22 FDISK will do the following:
1. If the first sector of the cylinder is a partition
table sector, then the rest of the track is unused,
and the partition starts with the the next track.
This applies to sector 0 (the MBR) and the partition table sectors
preceding logical partitions.
2. Otherwise, the partition starts at the first sector of the
cylinder. Also the extended partition starts at a cylinder boundary.
The <CODE>cfdisk</CODE> man page says that old versions of DOS did not
align partitions.
<P>Use of partition type 85 for the extended partition makes it invisible
to DOS, making sure that only Linux will look inside.
<P>As an aside: on a Sparc, the boot partition must start on a cylinder
boundary (but there is no requirement on the end).
