<P>Many programs come with some sort of documentation, often in a file called
README or something similar.  It is a VERY good idea to read them with
care.  It is boring to see (and answer) questions that are answered in
the documentation.  Most programs also have ``man pages''; use the command
<CODE>man programname</CODE> to get documentation on a program named
<CODE>programname</CODE>.  To get help using the man program, use
<CODE>man man</CODE>.
<P>Most distributions put other documentation about programs in the
directory /usr/doc/; your distribution should include documentation
on how to access that documentation.
