>13.1. Introduction</H2
><P
>From time to time you may want to read tapes made on a VMS machine (or tapes
that are made to be readable by VMS and *nix systems). In general, this is
quite easy for DECFILES11A tapes.</P
><P
>Although you may be reading this as part of a Linux mini-HOWTO, I believe
that the information here is applicable to any *nix system - I've done this
on Linux, HP, Sun and DEC *nix systems. The main platform dependences that I
know are device names, which can differ on different systems, and the
options to mt for specifying the device name (for example, mt -f on Linux
and mt -t on HPUX 9).</P
><P
>Caveat - I've only tried this with Exabyte 8mm SCSI tape drives. If you've
read other formats (still got those 9-tracks lying around?) let me know and
I'll add a note here.</P

>13.2. The Basics</H2
><P
>When reading a tape that has been made with the VMS ``copy'' command (or has
at least been made to look like it was made with copy) all you need to know
is there will be three files on the tape for each actual data file - a
header, the data, and a trailer.  The header and trailer are interesting in
that they contain info on the file as it existed under VMS.  The data is,
well, the data.  Each of these files can be extracted from the tape with the
dd command.  The tape can be positioned by skipping around with the mt
command.</P
><P
>Example: I've got VMS tape with a series of files on it.  The first two were
originally named ce66-2.evt and ce66-3.evt on a VMS system.  The tape label
is c66a2.</P

><P
>I'm left with six files: header1, data1, trailer1, header2, data2 and
trailer2.  The syntax here is if="input file", bs="block size" and
of="output file".  TAPE is expected to be a variable containing the device
name of your tape drive - for example, /dev/nts0 if you are using the first
SCSI tape on Linux.</P
><P
>If you wanted to read the second file, but not the first, you didn't care
about the header, and you wanted to use the original file name, do this:</P

>&#13;</P
><P
>Note the 4 - skip three files for the first file on the tape and one for the
next header.  The second mt skips the second file's trailer and positions
the tape at the beginning of the next file - the third VMS header.  You can
also use mt to skip backwards (bsf), rewind (rewind) and rewind and unload
the tape (offline, rewoffl).</P

>13.3. Some details</H2
><P
>The header and trailer files contain uppercase ASCII data used by VMS to
store file information such as block size.  They also contain the file name,
which can be handy if you want to build scripts that automate read files or
search for a particular file. The first header on a tape volume is slightly
different than subsequent headers.</P
><P
>For a file that is the first file on the tape, as in header1 of the above
example, the first four characters will be "VOL1" followed by the volume
name.  In the example, header1 starts with "VOL1C66A2".  This is followed by
a series of spaces terminated with a numeral.  After that is the string
"HDR1" which indicates that this is a file header.  The characters
immediately following the HDR1 string are the VMS file name.  In in the
example, this is "HDR1CE66-2.EVT".  The next field is the volume name again.</P
><P
>For files that are not the first file on the tape, the initial VOL1 field is
not present.  Other than that the header has the same structure as for the
initial file.  Another useful field is the 7th field, which will end with
"DECFILES11A".  This must be present on tapes that conform to the DEC
Files11A standard.</P

>13.4. Comment on Block Size</H2
><P
>In the example, I used a block size of 16k.  On a *nix system, there is no
block size associated with a file on disk while, under VMS, each file has a
specific block size.  That means that block size doesn't matter too much on
the Linux end... unless it makes it hard to read the tape.  If you have
difficulty figuring out the block size and reading a tape, you can try
setting the hardware block size on your tape drive using `mt -f $TAPE setblk
0'.  The exact form of the setblk option (and its availability) may depend
on the version of mt, the tape drive hardware interface and on your
particular flavor of *nix.</P
