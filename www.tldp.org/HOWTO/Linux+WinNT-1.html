<P>Bill Wohler wrote in his v1.1 of The Linux+WindowsNT mini-HOWTO:</P>
<P><EM>"Due to hardware or software problems or user headroom, I pulled my
hair out for several days trying to get both NT and Linux happily
settled on my new HP Vectra PC at work."</EM></P>
<P>I could say that was true in my case too, but you <B>really</B> have
a way to make both Linux and Windows NT co-existing on the same
machine and to switch from one of them to another.</P>

<P><EM>"Under no circumstances run the Disk Administrator from NT 3.51 to
format partitions.  It asks if it can write a signature "which will
cause absolutely no harm."  When it did this, it hosed my partition
table until fixed by steps 3 and 7 below.  Because of these
problems, I was limited to one FAT NT partition.  Also remember that
even if you do get the Disk Administrator to work, you'll want at
least one small FAT partition to use as a staging area for
exchanging files between Linux and NT until Linux has an NTFS
filesystem."</EM></P>
<P>Well, NT's Disk Administrator is sufficient tool to check what
situation on your hard disk(s) you have, before and after you used
an utility called Partition Magic by Power Quest. This utility
might be needed to 'shrink' your NT (either NTFS or FAT) partition,
in order to get some free space for your further Linux' partitions.
(After a while, I recognized that 'shrinking' used partition
might not be needed. Actually, if you start from 'scratch', it 
might be the best way to re-format your whole disk(s) using 
<B>FDISK</B> command. You should make a DOS boot floppy diskette 
where DOS commands FDISK and FORMAT have to be also copied. 
More details later...)</P>
<P><EM>"I installed Linux first and then NT, but based on my experience, I
might now be able to install NT first and then Linux."</EM></P>
<P>Of course you all are able to install Windows NT first and after that
Linux. We'll see how to do that and how to use <B>LILO</B> (<B>Li</B>nux
<B>Lo</B>ader) to chose which operating system to boot. But, before that
we'll see the procedure that Bill Wohler, the previous maintainer of
this mini-HOWTO, has been using:</P>
