<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Using the Solaris boot manager</A>
</H2>

<P>When booting, the Solaris boot manager gives you all 4
primary partitions for choosing which to boot from. If you had
your boot loader installed on the boot sector of a primary
partition, everything should be fine. Just boot from this
partition, and Linux should come up.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Using lilo</A>
</H2>

<P>Now you have lilo as a secondary boot loader, but you want
it to be your primary boot loader again? No Problem. Lilo
can easily chain boot Solaris. Just add the appropriate
<CODE>other=</CODE> lines to your lilo.conf
<P>For testing, you should add the Solaris chain loading to
the lilo in your boot sector first. Then try chain loading
lilo, Solaris, lilo, Solaris, ... until you have enough of
it. If this works, you should be able to put lilo back into
the MBR again.
<P>However, Solaris might have messed up your partition
table. This has happened on my system after installation of
Solaris&nbsp;8. Lilo doesn't like the new partition, nor does
fdisk. I had no problems with Solaris&nbsp;7
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Using grub</A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, I have no experience with grub booting
Solaris. If you do, please mail me!
