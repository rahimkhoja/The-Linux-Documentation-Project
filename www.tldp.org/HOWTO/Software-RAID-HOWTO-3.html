<P><B>This HOWTO is deprecated; the Linux RAID HOWTO is maintained as a wiki by the
linux-raid community at 
<A HREF="http://raid.wiki.kernel.org/">http://raid.wiki.kernel.org/</A></B></P>
<P>Software RAID devices are so-called "block" devices, like ordinary
disks or disk partitions. A RAID device is "built" from a number of
other block devices - for example, a RAID-1 could be built from two
ordinary disks, or from two disk partitions (on separate disks -
please see the description of RAID-1 for details on this).</P>
<P>There are no other special requirements to the devices from which you
build your RAID devices - this gives you a lot of freedom in designing
your RAID solution. For example, you can build a RAID from a mix of
IDE and SCSI devices, and you can even build a RAID from other RAID
devices (this is useful for RAID-0+1, where you simply construct two
RAID-1 devices from ordinary disks, and finally construct a RAID-0
device from those two RAID-1 devices).</P>
<P>Therefore, in the following text, we will use the word "device" as
meaning "disk", "partition", or even "RAID device". A "device" in the
following text simply refers to a "Linux block device". It could be
anything from a SCSI disk to a network block device. We will commonly
refer to these "devices" simply as "disks", because that is what they
will be in the common case.</P>
<P>However, there are several roles that devices can play in your
arrays. A device could be a "spare disk", it could have failed and
thus be a "faulty disk", or it could be a normally working and fully
functional device actively used by the array.</P>
<P>In the following we describe two special types of devices; namely the
"spare disks" and the "faulty disks".</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Spare disks</A>
</H2>

<P>Spare disks are disks that do not take part in the RAID set until one
of the active disks fail.  When a device failure is detected, that
device is marked as "bad" and reconstruction is immediately started
on the first spare-disk available.</P>
<P>Thus, spare disks add a nice extra safety to especially RAID-5 systems
that perhaps are hard to get to (physically). One can allow the system
to run for some time, with a faulty device, since all redundancy is
preserved by means of the spare disk.</P>
<P>You cannot be sure that your system will keep running after a disk
crash though. The RAID layer should handle device failures just fine,
but SCSI drivers could be broken on error handling, or the IDE chipset
could lock up, or a lot of other things could happen.</P>
<P>Also, once reconstruction to a hot-spare begins, the RAID layer will
start reading from all the other disks to re-create the redundant
information. If multiple disks have built up bad blocks over time, the
reconstruction itself can actually trigger a failure on one of the
"good" disks. This will lead to a complete RAID failure. If you do
frequent backups of the entire filesystem on the RAID array, then it
is highly unlikely that you would ever get in this situation - this is
another very good reason for taking frequent backups. Remember, RAID
is not a substitute for backups.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="Software-RAID-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">Faulty disks</A>
</H2>

<P>When the RAID layer handles device failures just fine, crashed disks
are marked as faulty, and reconstruction is immediately started
on the first spare-disk available.</P>
<P>Faulty disks still appear and behave as members of the array. The RAID
layer just treats crashed devices as inactive parts of the filesystem.</P>
