and was based on the original PMS program. It provides a fairly
complete and flexible node capability that is easily configured. It
allows users once they are connected to make Telnet, NET/ROM, ROSE, and
AX.25 connections out and to obtain various sorts of information such
as Finger, Nodes and Heard lists etc. You can configure the node to
execute any Linux command you wish fairly simply.</P

>The node would normally be invoked from the <EM

program although it is also capable of being invoked from the TCP/IP
<EM
>inetd</EM

machine and obtain access to it, or by running it from the command
line.</P

you to select which access method this permissions rule should apply to.
