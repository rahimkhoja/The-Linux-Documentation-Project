>As said, with queueing disciplines, we change the way data is sent.
Classless queueing disciplines are those that, by and large accept data and
only reschedule, delay or drop it.</P
><P
>These can be used to shape traffic for an entire interface, without any
subdivisions. It is vital that you understand this part of queueing before
we go on the the classful qdisc-containing-qdiscs!</P
><P
>By far the most widely used discipline is the pfifo_fast qdisc - this is the
default. This also explains why these advanced features are so robust. They
are nothing more than 'just another queue'.</P

may be as well tested.</P

><P
>This queue is, as the name says, First In, First Out, which means that no
packet receives special treatment. At least, not quite. This queue has 3 so
called 'bands'. Within each band, FIFO rules apply. However, as long as
there are packets waiting in band 0, band 1 won't be processed. Same goes
for band 1 and band 2.</P
><P
>The kernel honors the so called Type of Service flag of packets, and takes
care to insert 'minimum delay' packets in band 0. </P
><P
>Do not confuse this classless simple qdisc with the classful PRIO one!
Although they behave similarly, pfifo_fast is classless and you cannot add
other qdiscs to it with the tc command.</P

>9.2.2. Token Bucket Filter</H2
><P
>The Token Bucket Filter (TBF) is a simple qdisc that only passes packets
arriving at a rate which is not exceeding some administratively set rate, but
with the possibility to allow short bursts in excess of this rate.</P
><P
>TBF is very precise, network- and processor friendly. It should be your
first choice if you simply want to slow an interface down!</P
><P
>The TBF implementation consists of a buffer (bucket), constantly filled by
some virtual pieces of information called tokens, at a specific rate (token
rate). The most important parameter of the bucket is its size, that is the
number of tokens it can store.</P
><P
>Each arriving token collects one incoming data packet from the data queue
and is then deleted from the bucket. Associating this algorithm
with the two flows -- token and data, gives us three possible scenarios:</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
> The data arrives in TBF at a rate that's <EM
>equal</EM
> to the rate
of incoming tokens. In this case each incoming packet has its matching token
and passes the queue without delay.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> The data arrives in TBF at a rate that's <EM
>smaller</EM
> than the
token rate. Only a part of the tokens are deleted at output of each data packet
that's sent out the queue, so the tokens accumulate, up to the bucket size.
The unused tokens can then be used to send data a a speed that's exceeding the
standard token rate, in case short data bursts occur.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> The data arrives in TBF at a rate <EM
>bigger</EM
> than the token rate.
This means that the bucket will soon be devoid of tokens, which causes the
TBF to throttle itself for a while. This is called an 'overlimit situation'.
If packets keep coming in, packets will start to get dropped.</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>The last scenario is very important, because it allows to
administratively shape the bandwidth available to data that's passing
the filter.</P
><P
>The accumulation of tokens allows a short burst of overlimit data to be
still passed without loss, but any lasting overload will cause packets to be
constantly delayed, and then dropped.</P
><P
>Please note that in the actual implementation, tokens correspond to bytes,
not packets.</P

>Limit is the number of bytes that can be queued waiting for tokens to become
available. You can also specify this the other way around by setting the
latency parameter, which specifies the maximum amount of time a packet can
sit in the TBF. The latter calculation takes into account the size of the
bucket, the rate and possibly the peakrate (if set).</P
></DD

>burst/buffer/maxburst</DT
><DD
><P
>Size of the bucket, in bytes. This is the maximum amount of bytes that
tokens can be available for instantaneously. In general, larger shaping
rates require a larger buffer. For 10mbit/s on Intel, you need at least
10kbyte buffer if you want to reach your configured rate!</P

arrive per timer tick than fit in your bucket.</P

CLASS="VARIABLELIST"

><DT
>peakrate</DT
><DD
><P
>If tokens are available, and packets arrive, they are sent out immediately
by default, at 'lightspeed' so to speak. That may not be what you want,
especially if you have a large bucket. </P
><P
>The peakrate can be used to specify how quickly the bucket is allowed to be
depleted. If doing everything by the book, this is achieved by releasing a
packet, and then wait just long enough, and release the next. We calculated
our waits so we send just at peakrate.</P
><P
>However, due to de default 10ms timer resolution of Unix, with 10.000 bits
average packets, we are limited to 1mbit/s of peakrate!</P
></DD
><DT
>mtu/minburst</DT
><DD
><P
>The 1mbit/s peakrate is not very useful if your regular rate is more than
that. A higher peakrate is possible by sending out more packets per
timertick, which effectively means that we create a second bucket!</P
><P
>This second bucket defaults to a single packet, which is not a bucket at
all.</P

100 (or more correctly, HZ, which is 100 on Intel, 1024 on Alpha).</P

like a DSL modem or a cable modem, and you talk to it over a fast device,
like over an ethernet interface, you will find that uploading absolutely
destroys interactivity.</P

>This is because uploading will fill the queue in the modem, which is
probably *huge* because this helps actually achieving good data throughput
uploading. But this is not what you want, you want to have the queue not too
big so interactivity remains and you can still do other stuff while sending
data.</P

the modem - the queue will be in Linux, where we can control it to a limited

>9.2.3. Stochastic Fairness Queueing</H2
><P
>Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ) is a simple implementation of the fair
queueing algorithms family. It's less accurate than others, but it also
requires less calculations while being almost perfectly fair.</P
><P
>The key word in SFQ is conversation (or flow), which mostly corresponds to a
TCP session or a UDP stream. Traffic is divided into a pretty large number
of FIFO queues, one for each conversation. Traffic is then sent in a round
robin fashion, giving each session the chance to send data in turn.</P
><P
>This leads to very fair behaviour and disallows any single conversation from
drowning out the rest. SFQ is called 'Stochastic' because it doesn't really
allocate a queue for each session, it has an algorithm which divides traffic
over a limited number of queues using a hashing algorithm. </P
><P
>Because of the hash, multiple sessions might end up in the same bucket, which
would halve each session's chance of sending a packet, thus halving the
effective speed available. To prevent this situation from becoming
noticeable, SFQ changes its hashing algorithm quite often so that any two
colliding sessions will only do so for a small number of seconds.</P
><P
>It is important to note that SFQ is only useful in case your actual outgoing
interface is really full! If it isn't then there will be no queue on your
linux machine and hence no effect. Later on we will describe how to combine
SFQ with other qdiscs to get a best-of-both worlds situation.</P

cable modem or DSL router is pointless without further shaping!</P
