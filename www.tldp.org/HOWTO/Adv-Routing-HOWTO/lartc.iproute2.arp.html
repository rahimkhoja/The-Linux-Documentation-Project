>ARP is the Address Resolution Protocol as described in
<A
HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc826.html"
TARGET="_top"
>RFC 826</A
>.
ARP is used by a networked machine to resolve the hardware location/address of
another machine on the same
local network.  Machines on the Internet are generally known by their names
which resolve to IP
addresses.  This is how a machine on the foo.com network is able to communicate
with another machine which is on the bar.net network.  An IP address, though,
cannot tell you the physical location of a machine.  This is where ARP comes
into the picture.</P
><P
>Let's take a very simple example.  Suppose I have a network composed of several
machines.  Two of the machines which are currently on my network are foo
with an IP address of 10.0.0.1 and bar with an IP address of 10.0.0.2.
Now foo wants to ping bar to see that he is alive, but alas, foo has no idea
where bar is.  So when foo decides to ping bar he will need to send
out an ARP request.
This ARP request is akin to foo shouting out on the network "Bar (10.0.0.2)!
Where are you?"  As a result of this every machine on the network will hear
foo shouting, but only bar (10.0.0.2) will respond.  Bar will then send an
ARP reply directly back to foo which is akin
bar saying,
"Foo (10.0.0.1) I am here at 00:60:94:E9:08:12."  After this simple transaction
that's used to locate his friend on the network, foo is able to communicate
with bar until he (his arp cache) forgets where bar is (typically after
15 minutes on Unix).</P
><P
>Now let's see how this works.
You can view your machines current arp/neighbor cache/table like so:</P

address/location has now been added to the arp/neighbor cache.
So until the entry for
espa043 times out (as a result of no communication between the two) espa041
knows where to find espa043 and has no need to send an ARP request.</P

You can also see from the above output that espagate (9.3.76.1) has been
changed to the "stale" state.  This means that the location shown is still
valid, but it will have to be confirmed at the first transaction to that
machine.</P
