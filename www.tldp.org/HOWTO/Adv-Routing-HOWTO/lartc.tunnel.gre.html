>GRE is a tunneling protocol that was originally developed by Cisco, and it
can do a few more things than IP-in-IP tunneling. For example, you can also
transport multicast traffic and IPv6 through a GRE tunnel.</P

from A to B and vice versa. How and why, we do not care.</P

>Let's discuss this for a bit. In line 1, we added a tunnel device, and
called it netb (which is kind of obvious because that's where we want it to
go). Furthermore we told it to use the GRE protocol (mode gre), that the
remote address is 172.19.20.21 (the router at the other end), that our
tunneling packets should originate from 172.16.17.18 (which allows your
router to have several IP addresses on network C and let you decide which
one to use for tunneling) and that the TTL field of the packet should be set
to 255 (ttl 255).</P
><P
>The second line enables the device.</P
><P
>In the third line we gave the newly born interface netb the address
10.0.1.1. This is OK for smaller networks, but when you're starting up a
mining expedition (LOTS of tunnels), you might want to consider using
another IP range for tunneling interfaces (in this example, you could use
10.0.3.0).</P
><P
>In the fourth line we set the route for network B. Note the different notation for the netmask. If you're not familiar with this notation, here's how it works: you write out the netmask in binary form, and you count all the ones. If you don't know how to do that, just remember that 255.0.0.0 is /8, 255.255.0.0 is /16 and 255.255.255.0 is /24. Oh, and 255.255.254.0 is /23, in case you were wondering.</P
><P
>But enough about this, let's go on with the router of network B.

>Let's discuss this. In the first line, we created a tunnel device called sixbone. We gave it mode sit (which is IPv6 in IPv4 tunneling) and told it where to go to (remote) and where to come from (local). TTL is set to maximum, 255. Next, we made the device active (up). After that, we added our own network address, and set a route for 3ffe::/15 (which is currently all of 6bone) through the tunnel.</P

>GRE tunnels are currently the preferred type of tunneling. It's a standard that is also widely adopted outside the Linux community and therefore a Good Thing.</P
