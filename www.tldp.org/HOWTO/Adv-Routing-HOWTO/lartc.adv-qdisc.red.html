>14.5. Random Early Detection (RED)</H1
><P
>This section is meant as an introduction to backbone routing, which often
involves &#60;100 megabit bandwidths, which requires a different approach than
your ADSL modem at home.</P
><P
>The normal behaviour of router queues on the Internet is called tail-drop.
Tail-drop works by queueing up to a certain amount, then dropping all traffic
that 'spills over'. This is very unfair, and also leads to retransmit 
synchronization. When retransmit synchronization occurs, the sudden burst
of drops from a router that has reached its fill will cause a delayed burst
of retransmits, which will over fill the congested router again. </P
><P
>In order to cope with transient congestion on links, backbone routers will
often implement large queues. Unfortunately, while these queues are good for
throughput, they can substantially increase latency and cause TCP
connections to behave very burstily during congestion.</P
><P
>These issues with tail-drop are becoming increasingly troublesome on the
Internet because the use of network unfriendly applications is increasing.
The Linux kernel offers us RED, short for Random Early Detect, also called
Random Early Drop, as that is how it works.</P
><P
>RED isn't a cure-all for this, applications which inappropriately fail to 
implement exponential backoff still get an unfair share of the bandwidth,
however, with RED they do not cause as much harm to the throughput and
latency of other connections.</P
><P
>RED statistically drops packets from flows before it reaches its hard
limit. This causes a congested backbone link to slow more gracefully, and
prevents retransmit synchronization. This also helps TCP find its 'fair'
speed faster by allowing some packets to get dropped sooner keeping queue
sizes low and latency under control. The probability of a packet being
dropped from a particular connection is proportional to its bandwidth usage
rather than the number of packets it transmits. </P
><P
>RED is a good queue for backbones, where you can't afford the 
complexity of per-session state tracking needed by fairness queueing.</P
><P
>In order to use RED, you must decide on three parameters: Min, Max, and
burst. Min sets the minimum queue size in bytes before dropping will begin,
Max is a soft maximum that the algorithm will attempt to stay under, and
burst sets the maximum number of packets that can 'burst through'.</P
><P
>You should set the min by calculating that highest acceptable base queueing 
latency you wish, and multiply it by your bandwidth. For instance, on my 
64kbit/s ISDN link, I might want a base queueing latency of 200ms so I set
min to 1600 bytes. Setting min too small will degrade throughput and too
large will degrade latency. Setting a small min is not a replacement for
reducing the MTU on a slow link to improve interactive response.</P
><P
>You should make max at least twice min to prevent synchronization. On slow
links with small Min's it might be wise to make max perhaps four or
more times large then min.</P
><P
>Burst controls how the RED algorithm responds to bursts. Burst must be set
larger then min/avpkt. Experimentally, I've found (min+min+max)/(3*avpkt) to
work ok.</P
><P
>Additionally, you need to set limit and avpkt. Limit is a safety value, after
there are limit bytes in the queue, RED 'turns into' tail-drop. I typical set
limit to eight times max. Avpkt should be your average packet size. 1000
works OK on high speed Internet links with a 1500byte MTU. </P
