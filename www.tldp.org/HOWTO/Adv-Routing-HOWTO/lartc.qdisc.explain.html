>9.1. Queues and Queueing Disciplines explained</H1
><P
>With queueing we determine the way in which data is <EM
>SENT</EM
>.
It is important to realise that we can only shape data that we transmit.</P
><P
>With the way the Internet works, we have no direct control of what people
send us. It's a bit like your (physical!) mailbox at home. There is no way
you can influence the world to modify the amount of mail they send you,
short of contacting everybody.</P
><P
>However, the Internet is mostly based on TCP/IP which has a few features
that help us. TCP/IP has no way of knowing the capacity of the network
between two hosts, so it just starts sending data faster and faster ('slow
start') and when packets start getting lost, because there is no room to
send them, it will slow down. In fact it is a bit smarter than this, but
more about that later.</P
><P
>This is the equivalent of not reading half of your mail, and hoping that
people will stop sending it to you. With the difference that it works for
the Internet :-)</P
><P
>If you have a router and wish to prevent certain hosts within your network
from downloading too fast, you need to do your shaping on the *inner* interface
of your router, the one that sends data to your own computers.</P
><P
>You also have to be sure you are controlling the bottleneck of the link.
If you have a 100Mbit NIC and you have a router that has a 256kbit link,
you have to make sure you are not sending more data than your router can
handle.  Otherwise, it will be the router who is controlling the link and
shaping the available bandwith. We need to 'own the queue' so to speak, and
be the slowest link in the chain. Luckily this is easily possible.</P
