>6.1. IPv6 Tunneling</H1
><P
>This is another application of the tunneling capabilities of Linux. It is
popular among the IPv6 early adopters, or pioneers if you like.
The 'hands-on' example described below is certainly not the only way
to do IPv6 tunneling. However, it is the method that is often used to tunnel
between Linux and a Cisco IPv6 capable router and experience tells us that
this is just the thing many people are after. Ten to one this applies to
you too ;-)</P
><P
>A short bit about IPv6 addresses:</P
><P
>IPv6 addresses are, compared to IPv4 addresses, really big: 128 bits
against 32 bits. And this provides us just with the thing we need: many, many
IP-addresses: 340,282,266,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,465 to be
precise. Apart from this, IPv6 (or IPng, for IP Next Generation) is supposed
to provide for smaller routing tables on the Internet's backbone routers,
simpler configuration of equipment, better security at the IP level and
better support for QoS.</P
><P
>An example: 2002:836b:9820:0000:0000:0000:836b:9886</P
><P
>Writing down IPv6 addresses can be quite a burden. Therefore, to make
life easier there are some rules:</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Don't use leading zeroes. Same as in IPv4.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Use colons to separate every 16 bits or two bytes.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>When you have lots of consecutive zeroes,
you can write this down as ::. You can only do this once in an
address and only for quantities of 16 bits, though.</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>The address 2002:836b:9820:0000:0000:0000:836b:9886 can be written down
as 2002:836b:9820::836b:9886, which is somewhat friendlier.</P
><P
>Another example, the address 3ffe:0000:0000:0000:0000:0020:34A1:F32C can be
written down as 3ffe::20:34A1:F32C, which is a lot shorter.</P
><P
>IPv6 is intended to be the successor of the current IPv4. Because it
is relatively new technology, there is no worldwide native IPv6 network
yet. To be able to move forward swiftly, the 6bone was introduced. </P
><P
>Native IPv6 networks are connected to each other by encapsulating the IPv6
protocol in IPv4 packets and sending them over the existing IPv4 infrastructure
from one IPv6 site to another. </P
><P
>That is precisely where the tunnel steps in.</P
><P
>To be able to use IPv6, we should have a kernel that supports it. There
are many good documents on how to achieve this. But it all comes down to
a few steps:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Get yourself a recent Linux distribution, with suitable glibc.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Then get yourself an up-to-date kernel source.</P
></LI
></UL
>

If you are all set, then you can go ahead and compile an IPv6 capable
kernel:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Go to /usr/src/linux and type:</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>make menuconfig</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Choose "Networking Options"</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Select "The IPv6 protocol", "IPv6: enable EUI-64 token format", "IPv6:
disable provider based addresses"</P
></LI
></UL
>

HINT: Don't go for the 'module' option. Often this won't work well.</P
><P
>In other words, compile IPv6 as 'built-in' in your kernel.
You can then save your config like usual and go ahead with compiling
the kernel.</P
><P
>HINT: Before doing so, consider editing the Makefile:
EXTRAVERSION = -x ; --&#62; ; EXTRAVERSION = -x-IPv6</P
><P
>There is a lot of good documentation about compiling and installing
a kernel, however this document is about something else. If you run into
problems at this stage, go and look for documentation about compiling a
Linux kernel according to your own specifications.</P
><P
>The file /usr/src/linux/README might be a good start.
After you accomplished all this, and rebooted with your brand new kernel,
you might want to issue an '/sbin/ifconfig -a' and notice the brand 
new 'sit0-device'. SIT stands for Simple Internet Transition. You may give
yourself a compliment; you are now one major step closer to IP, the Next
Generation ;-)</P
><P
>Now on to the next step. You want to connect your host, or maybe even
your entire LAN to another IPv6 capable network. This might be the "6bone"
that is setup especially for this particular purpose.</P
><P
>Let's assume that you have the following IPv6 network: 3ffe:604:6:8::/64 and
you want to connect it to 6bone, or a friend. Please note that the /64
subnet notation works just like with regular IP addresses.</P
><P
>Your IPv4 address is 145.100.24.181 and the 6bone router has IPv4 address
145.100.1.5</P

>Let's discuss this. In the first line, we created a tunnel device called
sixbone. We gave it mode sit (which is IPv6 in IPv4 tunneling) and told it
where to go to (remote) and where to come from (local). TTL is set to
maximum, 255. </P
><P
>Next, we made the device active (up). After that, we added our own network
address, and set a route for 3ffe::/15 (which is currently all of 6bone)
through the tunnel. If the particular machine you run this on is your IPv6
gateway, then consider adding the following lines:</P

But if you don't have a Cisco at your disposal, try one of the many
IPv6 tunnel brokers available on the Internet. They are willing to configure
their Cisco with an extra tunnel for you. Mostly by means of a friendly
web interface. Search for "ipv6 tunnel broker" on your favourite search engine.</P
