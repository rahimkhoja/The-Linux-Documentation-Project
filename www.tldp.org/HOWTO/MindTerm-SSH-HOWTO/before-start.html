>   Businesses, schools, and home users need more secure network services now more than ever. As
   online business increases, more people continue to access critical company information over insecure
   networks. Companies are using the Internet as a primary means to communicate with travelling
   employees in their country and abroad, sending documents to various field offices around the world,
   and sending unencrypted email; this communication can contain a wealth of information that any
   malicious person can potentially intercept and sell or give to a rival company. Good security policies
   for both users and network administrators can help to minimize the problems associated with a
   malicious person intercepting or stealing critical information within their organization. This paper
   will discuss using Secure Shell (SSH) and MindTerm to secure organizational communication across
   the Internet.

   hijack or view a person's Internet traffic and access their companies. The malicious person may not be
   interested in the work the employee is doing but just want access to a high-speed server to launch
   attacks, store files, or other uses. Business people are really at high risk because they don't know who's
   monitoring their Internet connection in the hotel, airport, or anywhere in their travels. Users of the
   new high-speed connections are usually not taught proper security protocols and some companies
   don't have the staff to help the home user and business traveler set up secure communication.
   Individual users and, surprisingly, some companies have a mentality that <EM
>"I don't have anything people
   want"</EM
>. This is very disturbing considering the amount of sensitive information that travels across the
   Internet from an employee's home or from travelers. What's more disturbing is the availability of free
   software to perform these kinds of attacks and the software's ease of use. Dsniff

   is a freely available program that has utilities that can allow
   anyone with a networked computer to highjack a local network and monitor what others are doing and
   grab passwords and other sensitive data. In his book Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked
   World, Bruce Schneier states that Technique Propagation is one of the main threats to network
   security: <EM

   attacker has to be skilled; everyone else can use his software" (Schneier)</EM

>The way to ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely and quickly is to use encrypted methods
of data delivery. This can be by way of encrypted email, using secure web-based email services, or
establishing encrypted tunnels between two computers. Also, easy to setup and reliable software need
to be used in order to allow the inexperienced users the ability to quickly establish secure
communication channels. Taten Ylonen 's

>SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure replacement for remote login and file transfer programs like telnet, rsh,
and ftp, which transmit data in clear, human-readable text. SSH uses a public-key authentication
method to establish an encrypted and secure connection from the user's machine to the remote
machine. When the secure connection is established then the username, password, and all other
information is sent over this secure connection. You can read more details of how ssh works, the
algorithms it uses, and the protocols implemented for it to maintain a high level of security and trust
at the ssh website: 
<A
HREF="http://www.ssh.com"
TARGET="_top"
>www.ssh.com</A
>. The OpenBSD team has created a free alternative called OpenSSH
available at:
<A
HREF="http://www.openssh.com"
TARGET="_top"
>www.openssh.com</A
>. It maintains the high security standards of the OpenBSD team and the
IETF specifications for Secure Shell (see the
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/secsh.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Secure Shell IETF drafts</A
>,
except it uses free public domain algorithms. SSH is
becoming a standard for remote login administration. It has become so popular that there are many
ports of ssh to various platforms and there are free clients available to login to an ssh server from
many platforms as well. See 
<A
HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/security/ssh-clients"
TARGET="_top"
>http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/security/ssh-clients</A
>
for a list of clients
and Securityportal.com has an excellent two-part article on ssh and links to ports for different
platforms available at 
<A
HREF="http://www.securityportal.com/research/ssh-part1.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.securityportal.com/research/ssh-part1.html</A
>.
There are programs
that also use an ssh utility called Secure Copy (scp) in the background that provide the same
functionality of a full ftp client, like
<A
HREF="http://winscp.vse.cz"
TARGET="_top"
>WinSCP</A
> and the
<A
HREF="http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/"
TARGET="_top"
>Java SSH/SCP Client</A
>,
which has a modified scp interface for MindTerm. Please read the
licenses carefully to determine if you are legally allowed to download ssh in your country. SSH is free
for academic institutions please. Please read the licenses available at the ssh.com website. </P
><P
>MindTerm is an ssh client written entirely in Java by MindBright Technology. One of the key
practices of developing security software is proper implementation of the underlying algorithms and
protocols it uses. MindBright Technology has implemented the ssh protocol very well in this small
application file. It is a self-contained archive that only needs to be unzipped into a directory of your
choice and it is ready to be used. It can be used as a standalone program or as a web page applet or both.
It is available at: 
<A
HREF="http://www.mindbright.se/download/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.mindbright.se/download/</A
>.
MindTerm is an excellent and inexpensive
client to secure communication to and from a local and remote location. The MindTerm program
located at the download address above is available free for non-commercial and academic use,
commercial use is available on a case to case basis. However, the modifications made by the
<A
HREF="http://www.isnetworks.net"
TARGET="_top"
>ISNetwork</A
>
 <EM
>"is based on the MindTerm 1.21 codebase, which MindBright released
under the GPL [General Public License -- see
<A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org"
TARGET="_top"
> 
http://www.gnu.org</A
>].
Since our version is released
under the GPL you can use it commercially for free" (Eckels)</EM
>. ISNetwork's implementation has all the
features of MindBright's MindTerm except it has a nicer scp interface for more user-friendly file
transfers. MindTerm does have some drawbacks in that it doesn't support UDP tunneling. In order to
secure UDP traffic, a program called Zebedee (
<A
HREF="http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/</A
>)
will work nicely.
Zebedee's server and client program is available for Windows and Linux platforms. It is freely
distributed under the GPL License too. You can connect to either Windows or Linux machines using
Zebedee. MindTerm will not check to see if your system is secure. It is up to the administrators and
users to take care of securing the computer systems. It is easy to implement and it is very effective at
maintaining the high level of security implemented in the ssh protocol. This paper will show how easy
it is to set up and establish secure communication channels for almost any user and by almost any user.
Documents, email, and other data communication can be easily and securely sent to users a few feet
away or around the world.</P

>2.3. How MindTerm and SSH work together</A
></H2
><P
>SSH and MindTerm will work together to use a technique called port forwarding. Port forwarding is
forwarding traffic from one host and a given port to another host and port. In other words, the
MindTerm application will open a port on the client's machine (local machine) and any connection to
that local port is forwarded to the remote host and its listening port over an encrypted ssh session.
Whether or not the connection is accepted depends on the type of request you are sending to the
remote host. For example, you wouldn't forward POP requests to a remote host listening on port 21
because port 21 is reserved for ftp requests. Port forwarding is also used to allow connections to a
server that is behind a firewall and/or has a private IP address. Essentially this is creating a Virtual
Private Network (VPN). A VPN is <EM
>"a private data network that makes use of the public
telecommunication infrastructure, maintaining privacy through the use of a tunneling protocol and
security procedures"</EM
> (
<A
HREF="http://www.whatis.com"
TARGET="_top"
>www.whatis.com</A
>
). The port-forwarding can only be done with TCP services.</P
