>   For various reasons this brand new release is codenamed the
   <EM
>release</EM
> release.
  </P
><P
>   New code names will appear as per industry standard
   guidelines to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this
   document.
  </P
><P
>   This document was written when I read a feedback asking for a
   template to fill in to make new HOWTOs. This template was
   initially made by extracting the skeletal structure of the Multi
   Disk HOWTO which is a rather large HOWTO. It then went through
   extensive editing.
  </P
><P
>   Stating the background is a simple way to getting started
   writing the intro.
  </P
><P
>   First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development
   shows it is quite important.
