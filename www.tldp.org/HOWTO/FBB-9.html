<P>2003-01-01</P>

<P><EM>Notice: Until recently, I preferred to download "factory-made"
executables in RPM format (something like ZIP in MS Windows world).
After getting a RPM package, a click on it activates the program
that unpack and install its content. Well, it is great whenever
your RPM has been "manufactured" for the very similar distribution
of Linux you have. If not ...</EM></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Well, I have already had the package 
<CODE>xfbb-7.04-2.i386.rpm</CODE> (07 August 2001), that was
running OK under RH 6.2 distro. And not only that. Its
"packer", Jose HI8GN, has explained that this package
was actually compiled and linked with utilities that came
with RH 6.2 - so under that distribution should be no
problems at all.


</LI>
<LI>One day I finally decided to abandon another 4-5 year old 
version of an X11 LinFBB <EM>application</EM> that I knew it would
not run under Red Hat Linux newer than 6.2 distribution. 
I decided to stay with LinFBB's daemon only, so it was also the
right time to upgrade the Linux system itself. Another handy
installation that I had, was RH 7.1 and I used it. After
finishing that task, I rushed to re-install the RPM package
mentioned above (just to test if it would eventually work), but as
expected it didn't want to run.


</LI>
<LI>I had no choice but to browse web sites in order to find a RPM 
package that would fit my RH 7.1 distribution. Unfortunately,
it looked that there was no one recompiled LinFBB RPM for 7.1
RedHat version. The only solution was to try with <EM>tarballs</EM>. 
So, what I have downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://www.f6fbb.org/versions.html">www.f6fbb.org/versions.html</A>, was <CODE>xd704h-src.tgz</CODE>
archive.


</LI>
<LI>So far - so good. Well, folks, I am not very good of "deepest"
secrets of Linux, so I was not sure where might be the best
place to unpack the archive. According the <EM>readme</EM>
file, it might be a "fbbsrc" directory, so I considered that
<B>/usr/src</B> would be the best location to copy archive's
<B>fbbsrc.704h</B> directory tree.


</LI>
<LI>Well, the <B>fbbsrc.704h</B> directory consists of 12 files and 7
subdirectories, one of which is <B>src</B> subdirectory. As the 
<EM>readme</EM> suggested a user to "goto fbbsrc/src" directory, 
I concluded that <B>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704h/src</B> was the right place.


</LI>
<LI>The <EM>readme</EM> also suggested to "update the variables" at
the beginning of <EM>Makefile</EM> files, but I did not do that
because I was not sure what exactly should be put in there. So I have
just left the file(s) intact.


</LI>
<LI>The next task was to run <EM>make</EM> command from the shell
and it took half a minute to be finished. The results were several
<EM>xfbb</EM> executable files that I quickly moved to
<B>/usr/sbin</B> directory. BTW, some people rather suggest to run
<EM>make install</EM> (instead of <EM>make</EM>), in order to avoid 
multiple copying of compiled executables, but I found that way as not 
functional.


</LI>
<LI>Soon after, I tried to activate <B>xfbbd</B> - the new LinFBB's 
<EM>daemon</EM> and it seemed to work without visible difficulties. 
Using a home LAN including a Windows laptop, I also started <B>fbbW</B> 
- a LinFBB Windows client. It recognized the <EM>daemon</EM> in a second 
and I've only noticed that there was no Protus password utility running.


</LI>
<LI>According the <EM>readme</EM>, the next task should be to "compile
the xfbbC client". That operation should be done from a place
called "fbbsrc/client" but the only available directory under
<B>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704h/src</B> was <B>X11</B>.


</LI>
<LI>After clicking on its icon, I recognized the second one file
named <EM>Makefile</EM> (they have mentioned "updating" of 
<EM>both</EM> Makefile files, so I hoped to reach the proper
place once again, regardless of two unfamiliar paths). Besides that,
they have also suggested to use "at least the version 2.1.37b of 
ax25-utils" and I found <EM>not</EM> to have something like that 
installed (in the case they have possibly meant of a <EM>suit</EM> 
of libax25, ax25apps and ax25tool - than it should be OK). Anyway, 
then I activated <EM>make</EM> command from the shell one more time 
and the result was in getting <EM>xfbbC</EM> executable.


</LI>
<LI>As usual, <B>xfbbC</B> client is to be invoked from within an
<EM>xterm</EM> (or similar) command line environment. It also seemed 
that it was fully functional. So far - so good.


</LI>
<LI>The next issue was to "compile the xfbbX client", but this time
a user was requested to have a version of Motif installed. Well,
what I already knew was that I haven't had any Motif software in the box, 
but a couple of Lesstif RPM packages were somewhere around. I installed them
using <CODE>--force</CODE> and <CODE>--nodeps</CODE> options in order to avoid
various <EM>dependency</EM> 'obstacles'. In sum, Lestiff stuff has 
come to its place on the hard disk.


</LI>
<LI>This one time, I did make some "updates" related to <EM>Makefile</EM>
paths and tried to run <EM>make</EM> command from the shell (for
the 3rd time now). At the first sight, it seemed that I got no answer, 
because there appeared neither <B>xfbbX</B> nor <B>xfbbX_cl</B> 
executables. In order to "make" missing files, I just copied the 
appropriate executables from an earlier LinFBB version (which I backup-ed 
before).


</LI>
<LI>Finally, I managed to activate <B>xfbbX</B> client without visible
problems, although I knew it was not an up-to-date version (compared
to the <EM>daemon</EM> itself). Regardless of that detail, the GUI 
client worked properly.


</LI>
<LI>As I just mentioned, I also noticed that the first console connection
was without familiar <B>{PROTUS-4.1b7}</B> designation (that means
there was no <EM>c_filter</EM> utility running). So, I had
to check and double-check all the paths and system directories,
described in the Protus section of this mini-HOWTO. At the first
sight, it looked to me that everything was fine, but the utility
was not likely to start. Finally, I copied its main executable
into yet another system location: <B>/usr/lib/fbb/filter</B>,
re-started the system once again and Protus returned back to its 
function.


</LI>
<LI>That was all. I am satisfied with what I have done for the first time. 
What I have to do in the future, will be to check if the procedure
described in this section was the right one, although most of the
BBS's main features seemed to be active (just like as if they were 
running under RH 6.2 distribution using LinFBB packages in RPM format
mentioned earlier). The only "mystery" was how to activate some
system administering tasks: maintenance (a "housekeeping"), get
user's data and other tasks easily accessed from under WinFBB main
console (for example). Until now I haven't solved that, but that
is not a real problem because I can also run WinFBB whenever my
Windows is active, and from there I can perform sysop's tasks, using
a mouse click or like.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="FBB.html#toc9.2">fbbsrc.704j (using Red Hat 7.1)</A>
</H2>

<P>2004-01-03</P>

<P><EM>Notice: The other day I tried to upgrade my Red Hat 7.1
distribution to Red Hat 9.0 - in order to get more up-to-date
system, being also capable to be upgraded from its original Netscape
4.76 browser to Netscape 7.1 (In fact, the more newer Netscape
I need for other purposes - not related to FBB stuff at all - but I have
not succeeded to perform a kind of a 'browser-only' upgrade (In fact,
Netscape 7.1 needs newer <EM>Glibc</EM> and some other things not
easily being upgraded within under Red Hat 7.1). That's why I decided 
to upgrade the complete Linux system - i.e. not just reinstalling it 
'from scratch'. The reason for that was I wanted to preserve my old
Netscape Messenger email directory tree etc). So, at first, I made cca. 
450 MB of free space on my / partition, hoping that would be enough to 
upgrade. But, RH 9.0's setup asked for even more 400 MB - that I couldn't
made. Then I tried to make a 'fresh' installation of RH 9.0 and it also
looked that I had better supply a larger hard disk (besides that,
it seemed that RH 9.0 performed a bit slower on my system than the old
RH 7.1). Finally, I made a decision to re-install RH 7.1 again.</EM></P>

<P>After I did it, one of the first tasks to do was to install LinFBB. I
took some browsing in order to find something newer than that
<B>fbbsrc.704h</B> and I've got <B>fbbsrc.704j</B> <EM>tarball</EM> 
from 
<A HREF="ftp://www.f6fbb.org/pub/f6fbb/distrib/linux/src">ftp://www.f6fbb.org/pub/f6fbb/distrib/linux/src</A></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>At first, I extracted <EM>.tgz</EM> package to the <B>/usr/src</B> 
directory. <B>fbbsrc.704j</B> consists of 7 subdirs and 12 files.
According to its <EM>readme</EM>, at the beginning I should 'goto fbbsrc/src 
directory' so I went to <B>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704j/src</B>


</LI>
<LI>The <EM>readme</EM> also suggested to "update the variables" 
at the beginning of <EM>Makefile</EM> files, but I just left 
the file(s) intact.


</LI>
<LI>The next task was to run <EM>make</EM> command from the shell
and it took almost two minutes to be finished. The result was new
<EM>xfbb</EM> executables (clr_user, epurmess, epurwp, fbbgetconf, 
maintinf, reqdir, xfbbC and xfbbd) that I quickly moved to
<B>/usr/sbin</B> directory. 


</LI>
<LI>Then I copied <B>fbb.conf</B> (previously backup-ed) as well as
other config stuff that should go to <B>/etc/ax25/fbb</B> directory. 
I have <EM>not</EM> created new directories LinFBB should use as a 
'normal' Linux-only BBS (a 'configuration tree', a 'utilities tree'
and a 'data tree' - all of which suggested by /usr/src/fbbsrc.704j/FBBTREE
file. If I haven't copied my backup-ed <B>fbb.conf</B> (that, in turn, has
been configured to share config files with my WinFBB on a spare FAT16
partition) and if I wanted to activate LinFBB's daemon <EM>before</EM>
copying my particular <B>fbb.conf</B> - then I had to create those
FBB-trees. In opposite, LinFBB couldn't run.


</LI>
<LI>Soon after, I tried to activate LinFBB's <EM>daemon</EM> and
it seemed to work without visible difficulties (using a temporary home
LAN with a laptop, I performed <B>telnet xfbbd_IP_address 6300</B>, from
Windows' utility Command Prompt. It recognized the <EM>daemon</EM> 
in a second and I've only noticed that there was no Protus password 
utility running). The latter I solved by copying /var/ax25/fbb/protus/c_filter
file to a location /usr/lib/fbb/filter and re-starting LinFBB. To make more
tests, I have also installed <B>xfbbW</B> (Windows client for LinFBB). It 
also worked fine.


</LI>
<LI>According the <EM>readme</EM>, the next task should be to 
"compile the xfbbX client". That operation is to be performed from 
a place called "fbbsrc/client" but the only sub-directory available 
under <B>/usr/src/fbbsrc.704j/src</B> was <B>X11</B> subdir. 
I went there, but <EM>before</EM> trying to activate <B>make</B>
again, I also installed a couple of <B>LessTif</B> RPM packages
of version 0.93.18-1 (lesstif, lesstif-mwm, lesstif-devel and lesstif-
clients). In fact, I haven't had a version of Motif to be installed.


</LI>
<LI>Once again, I did not make "updates" related to <EM>Makefile</EM>
paths and just tried to run <EM>make</EM> from the shell (for the 
2nd time now). In a half a minute, I got two new executables:
<B>xfbb</B> and <B>xfbbX_cl</B>. I also copied them to 
<B>/usr/sbin</B> directory, accompanied with <B>xfbbX</B>
shell script. The difference to the older version 704h was that 
this time I haven't had to apply the GUI client executables from 
an earlier version I have backup-ed previously. That means, I
could be sure now that both <EM>server</EM> and <EM>client</EM>
parts of LinFBB are of the very same version.


</LI>
<LI>Then I entered /usr/sbin/xfbbX and soon after XFBB Setup screen
appeared, asking to enter the Callsign and Password. From the
Help menu, I checked for About and Copyright and I was satisfied
when noticed that it was 7.04j version of the Linux GUI client.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="FBB.html#toc9.3">fbbsrc.704j (using Red Hat 9.0)</A>
</H2>

<P>2004-01-05</P>

<P><EM>Notice: Although I managed to compile all parts of the newest
LinFBB version, I was not so happy because my Linux platform was
still the old one: Red Hat 7.1 and I wanted to have 9.0 version.
That's why I started planning what to do with the things intended
to be backup-ed <EM>before</EM> the another fresh installation of
Linux. The main trouble were the existing Netscape 4.76 email 
folders, because it was obvious that the 4.76 directory structure 
greatly differ from Netscape 7.1 folder tree. In fact, a user of 
Netscape 4.76 email only has to make a backup copy of the hidden 
<B>.nsmail</B> directory that, in turn, has to be restored into 
the same location <EM>after</EM> the eventual next re-installation 
of the Red Hat 7.1 distribution. That is a simple task to do. But, 
the problem with newer Netscape 7.1 was that it has the different 
directory tree when compared to its predecessor, in addition to 
a slightly changed email structure. In fact, I tried to use Netscape 
4.76's <B>.nsmail</B> directory with the fresh Netscape 7.1 
installation and that just didn't want to run properly. Than I looked 
for another way to accomplish that task and here is how I did it.</EM></P>

<P>I already knew that Netscape and Mozilla software (in particular
the newer one versions of them) converge in a way they seem to
use a similar or the very same "engine" as well as the directory
structure. Having in mind that the newer Red Hat 9.0 distribution
have <EM>not</EM> offered any version of Netscape software at all
and that Mozilla packages remained in the newer Red Hat's - I 
decided to perform the following steps:</P>

<P>1. to make a simple <EM>upgrade</EM> from Red Hat 7.1 to Red Hat 
9.0 (in order to keep the original Netscape's 4.76 <B>.nsmail</B> 
directory structure <EM>intact</EM>, but to get an up-to-dated 
version of Mozilla which comes with this particular Red Hat upgrade 
and that is the same as Mozilla after the 'fresh' installation 
of RH 9.0);</P>

<P>2. to make an <EM>import</EM> of the existing email from Netscape 
4.76 to Mozilla (interestingly, the new Mozilla only supports an
<EM>import</EM> from a "Netscape 4.x");</P>

<P>3. to make a <EM>backup</EM> copy of the new Mozilla's directory 
structure;</P>

<P>4. to make a <EM>'fresh' installation</EM> of Red Hat 9.0 (in order 
to ensure the stable environment that, in turn, will also have the 
same new Mozilla);</P>

<P>5. to make a <EM>'restore'</EM> of Mozilla's directory structure 
(previously backup-ed);</P>

<P>6. to <EM>install</EM> the new Netscape 7.1 that, as mentioned, will 
use the <EM>same</EM> directory structure as the new Mozilla;</P>

<P>7. to <EM>have</EM> a choice: to run either Netscape or Mozilla (if 
you get bored from either of them :-)).</P>

<P>Well, these steps were the nice mental exercise, but finally I got
them all running as I wanted. After I got sure that the Internet
email and browsing capabilities of my new Red Hat 9.0 became OK, I
got to the beginning of LinFBB installation procedure. Now I am not 
going to repeat the items from the previous LinFBB sub-section, but 
what I would like to say is that the step 4. (a couple of paragraphs 
above) have not brought some X Window development packages, needed 
for compiling of <B>xfbbX</B>. I mean, once again I managed to 
compile <EM>xfbbd</EM> and <EM>xfbbC</EM> without problems, but a 
<B>make</B> of xfbbX haven't produced the result I expected. In
fact, it returned something like this:</P>

<P>I was advised by the friendly FBB-hams that obviously something of the

<P>
<UL>
<LI>As long as I know, all these <EM>lesstif</EM> packages 
don't belong to either Red Hat 7.1 nor 9.0 distribution.
I have probably downloaded them as a '3rd party' software.
Besides that, I also noticed that Red Hat 9.0 installation
CD's do include the following:

<LI>And, as they said: ... and after all that had happened,

<P>What remains to be explored (at least for me) is to see how to

Your suggestions are welcomed (they can be added as contributions

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="FBB.html#toc9.4">fbbsrc.704o (using Mandrake 9.1)</A>
</H2>

<P>2008-01-13</P>

<P><EM>Notice: I started to play with <EM>Mandrake release 9.1 for
i586 (Bamboo)</EM> some two years ago. That version was equipped
with kernel <B>2.4.21-0.13mdk</B> and, as you can expect, after
the installation of the new OS, I decided to put fbbsrc.704j on it
because I was familiar with version 7.04j. Unfortunately, in that
particular iteration I have only managed to compile the server
part of LinFBB (xfbbd) and despite my best efforts I couldn't have
produced the graphical client (xfbbX). As you have learned above
what I was experiencing with earlier LinFBB versions when I was
about to compile GUI clients, I tried to follow the same procedure
once again: I mean to ensure that Motif (LessTif) was there etc.
But whatever I tried to install/uninstall I haven't got any success
with the client. So, I ended up with running xfbbd v. 7.04j and
xfbbX v. 7.00g24 (dated Oct 16 1999) which was included in 7.04j
tarball. You can imagine that I was not happy with such confusing
situation, so I decided to try something that reached the markets
in Sep 2007: a new version 7.04o</EM></P>

<P>Since the previous version I was using, it seems that LinFBB has
changed its maintainer, though I don't know if Bernard, F6BVP took
the 'job' from F6FBB officially or not. Regardless of that, I expected
to see some improvements in a way they constructed GUI clients to
make it easier to compile xfbbX - regardless a distribution of
Linux being used. This time I downloaded the package from F6BVP's
location: 
<A HREF="http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o-src.tgz">http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o-src.tgz</A></P>

<P>The procedure with xd704o-src.tgz is the same as it was with earlier
versions of LinFBB - so I am not going to replay how to compile the
executable files. A new fact for me was that the base directory tree
of LinFBB keeps changing (it started to change from version 7.04n).
Now, almost all parts of the program have to be placed in subdirectories
of <B>/usr/local</B> but at the first moment I missed that point.
To be precize, I was used earlier to put new executables into /usr/sbin
directory with other similar files, the configuration files into /etc, etc.
When I tried to activate xfbbd within the old locations, nothing happened so
I thought the compilation process might have failured. After recognizing
my mistake and moving the program parts in accordance with instructions
provided (always read the manuals!), another incarnation of LinFBB
<EM>daemon</EM> started to run immediately. To be honest, I haven't
noticed anything special with it, so I rushed to compile the client xfbbX.</P>

<P>By the way, besides the location I downloaded xd704o-src.tgz from, I also
noticed 
<A HREF="http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o_i386.tgz">http://f6bvp.free.fr/logiciels/BBS-f6fbb/xd704o_i386.tgz</A> which I
supposed to be a version for older CPUs, like PI or PII. Instead, it
appeared that it was the complete structure of LinFBB's new directory
tree, including already compiled versions of xfbbd and other executables,
minus the client xfbbX - which found me a bit disapointed.</P>

<P>I did not have any option but to try compilation of xfbbX by myself. At
first, I tried to position myself to the proper location, as follows:</P>

<P>At that point it looked to me that something was missing within
the installation of LessTif/Motif but I don't have any idea about
what might be wrong. If somebody has some ideas, it may help, so
please do not hesitate to contact me via email: skoric at eunet

<P>Interestingly, I faced to the very same symptoms earlier when
tried to compile the GUI front-end of <B>fbbsrc.704j</B> where
all I managed to have was the following:</P>

<P>Then too I got no clues what was  caused the errors close to the end of
the sequence above and I would really appreciate if somebody would be
kind enough to give me some pointers. Actually, all 'make' tries just
haven't produced either xfbbX or xfbbX_cl files (or I happened not to
find them elsewhere?). The only idea I've got was just to try executing
(i.e. mouse clicking on) the original xfbbX <EM>shell script</EM> (dated
09/07/03) which resulted in opening XFBB's main GUI window, asking
for callsign, pasword etc. I am not so sure if things should have gone
that way, because as explained in earlier installations, I managed to
compile xfbbX and xfbbX_cl files, move them to /usr/sbin and activate from
there.</P>

<P>After some Internet searching for ideas, I got an email from VK5KMG:</P>

<P>"Hi there Misko, it might be more of a help if you included your complete
operating system,ie: computer,processor and so on.
As to the ax25 stuff you will need libax25-0.0.11 ax25-apps-0.0.6
ax25-tools-0.0.8.
You should be able to get rpm's of these.</P>
<P>Th original compile error was in regard to the updated ax25stuff wnerein
you will have to edit the necessary files to reflect the use of the later
versions,,,,,alternatively if you are using a 2.2 kernel ( though the later
updated stuff works quite ok on the earlier kernels) you would need the
ax25-utils package, then FBB would compile up ok using the earlier stuff.</P>
<P>To get the X stuff compiled you will have to go into the relative dir in
src and compile the files in there and install manually."</P>

<P>I have also downloaded the following versions of AX25 packages from
the Net:</P>
<P>libax25-0.0.11-1.i386.rpm
ax25-apps-0.0.6-178.i586.rpm
ax25-tools-0.0.8-324.i586.rpm</P>

<P>Although all three complained for bad file signatures or like, I
managed to install all of them. What followed a repeated 'make'
command, was the same failed output. For your information, I tried
to tweak appropriate Makefile file before doing <EM>make</EM> in
fbb/source/X11 directory, for several times now, but nothing helped.</P>

<P>According to earlier 'symptoms' of that type of an error, I was
suspicious that I have forgotten to install some parts of developing
software - related to graphical environment. In order to check what
actually was installed per default (Mandrake 9.1 distribution), I
did the following test:</P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@localhost src]# rpm -qa *lesst*
lesstif-0.93.36-2mdk
[root@localhost src]#
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>It was obvious that some of the X Window development parts of lestiff
routines were missing here. I started Mandrake 9.1 Control Center's
RpmDrake, searching there for possible lestiff-related packages and
found three of them. After having them installed, I performed another test:</P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@localhost src]# rpm -qa *lesst*
lesstif-mwm-0.93.36-2mdk
lesstif-clients-0.93.36-2mdk
lesstif-0.93.36-2mdk
lesstif-devel-0.93.36-2mdk
[root@localhost src]#
      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Then it seemed that I finally got all four parts of lestiff, but
regardless of that I was not able to compile the xfbbX client.</P>
<P>I would appreciate if someone has new pointers to solve this issue.</P>
