>Here's where the concept of a desktop environment kicks in. The
idea is that a desktop environment provides a set of facilities and
guidelines aiming to standardizing all the stuff we mentioned so that
the problems we mentioned earlier are minimized.</P
><P
>The concept of a desktop environment is something new to people
coming for the first time to Linux because it's something that other
operating systems (like Windows and the Mac OS) intrinsically
have. For example, MacOS, which is one of the earliest graphical user
interfaces, provides a very consistent look-and-feel during the entire
computing session. For instance, the operating system provides a lot
of the niceties we mentioned: it provides a default file manager (the
finder), a systemwide control panel, and single toolkit that all
applications have to use (so they all look the same). Application
windows are managed by the system (strictly speaking there's a window
manager working there). Finally, there are a set of guidelines that
tell developers how their applications should behave, recommend
control looks and placement, and suggest behaviors according to those
of other applications on the system. All this is done in the sake of
consistency and ease of use.</P
><P
>This begs the question, "why didn't the X developers do things
that way in the first place?". It makes sense; after all, it would
have avoided all the problems we mentioned earlier. The answer is that
in designing X, its creators chose to make it as flexible as
possible. Going back to the policy/mechanism paradigm, the MacOS
provides mostly policies. Mechanisms are there, but they don't
encourage people to play with those. As a result I lose versatility;
if I don't like the way MacOS manages my windows, or the toolkit
doesn't provide a function I need, I'm pretty much out of luck. This
doesn't happen under X, altough as seen before, the price of
flexibility is greater complexity.</P
><P
>Under Linux/Unix and X, it all comes down to agreeing on stuff
and sticking to it. Let's take KDE for example. KDE includes a single
window manager (kwm), which manages and controls the behavior of our
windows. It recommends using a certain graphic toolkit (Qt), so that
all KDE applications look the same, as far as their on-screen controls
go. KDE further extends Qt by providing a set of environment-specific
libraries (kdelibs) for performing common tasks like creating menus,
"about" boxes, program toolbars, communicating between programs,
printing, selecting files, and other things. These make the
programmer's work easier and standardize the way these special
features behave. KDE also provides a set of design and behavior
guidelines to programmers, with the idea that, if everybody follows
them, programs running under KDE will both look and behave very
similarly. Finally, KDE provides, as part of the environment, a
launcher panel (kpanel), a standard file manager (which is, at the
time being, Konqueror), and a configuration utility (control panel)
from which we can control many aspects of our computing environment,
from settings like the desktop's background and the windows' titlebar
color to hardware configurations.</P
><P
>The KDE panel is an equivalent to the MS Windows taskbar. It
provides a central point from which to launch applications, and it
also provides for small applications, called "applets", to be
displayed within it. This gives functionality like the small, live
clock most users can't live without.</P
