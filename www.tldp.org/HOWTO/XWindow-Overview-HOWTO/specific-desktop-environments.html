>We used KDE as an example, but it's by no means the earliest
desktop environment for Unix systems. Perhaps one of the earliest is
CDE (Common Desktop Environment), another sibling of the OSF. As per
the CDE FAQ: "The Common Desktop Environment is a standard desktop for
UNIX, providing services to end-users, systems administrators, and
application developers consistently across many platforms." The key
here is consistency. However CDE wasn't as feature-rich and easy as it
needed to be. Along with Motif, CDE has practically disappeared from
the free software world, having been replaced by better alternatives.</P
><P
>Under Linux, the two most popular desktop environments are KDE
and GNOME, but they're not the only ones. A quick internet search will
reveal about half a dozen desktop environments: GNUStep, ROX,
GTK+XFce, UDE, to name a few. They all provide the basic facilities we
mentioned earlier. GNOME and KDE have had the most support, both from
the community and the industry, so they're the most advanced ones,
providing a large amount of services to users and applications.</P
><P
>We mentioned KDE and the components that provide specific
services under that environment. As a good desktop environment, GNOME
is somewhat similar in that. The most obvious difference is that GNOME
doesn't mandate a particular window manager (the way KDE has kwm). The
GNOME project has always tried to be window manager-agnostic,
acknowledging that most users get really attached to their window
managers, and forcing them to use something that manages windows
differently would detract from their audience. Originally GNOME
favored the Enlightenment window manager, and currently their
preferred window manager is Sawfish, but the GNOME control panel has
always had a window manager selector box.</P
><P
>Other than this, GNOME uses the Gtk toolkit, and provides a set
of higher-level functions and facilities through the gnome-libs set of
libraries. GNOME has its own set of programming guidelines in order to
guarantee a consistent behavior between compliant applications; it
provides a panel (called just "panel"), a file manager (gmc, altough
it's probably going to be superseded by Nautilus), and a control panel
(the gnome control center).</P
