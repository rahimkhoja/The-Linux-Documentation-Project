>However, we never mentioned how the X server handles
manipulation of the clients' on-screen display areas (called
windows). It's obvious, to anyone who's ever used a GUI, that you need
to have control over the "client windows". Typically you can move and
arrange them; change size, maximize or minimize windows. How, then,
does the X server handle these tasks? The answer is: it doesn't.</P
><P
>One of X's fundamental tenets is "we provide mechanism, but not
policy". So, while the X server provides a way (mechanism) for window
manipulation, it doesn't actually say how this manipulation behaves
(policy).</P
><P
>All that mechanism/policy weird stuff basically boils down to
this: it's another program's responsibility to manage the on-screen
space. This program decides where to place windows, gives mechanisms
for users to control the windows' appearance, position and size, and
usually provides "decorations" like window titles, frames and buttons,
that give us control over the windows themselves. This program, which
manages windows, is called (guess!) a "window manager".</P
><P
>"The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not
part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges --
and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many,
which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and
different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and
colormap focus."</P
><P
>The X architecture provides ways for a window manager to
perform all those actions on the windows; but it doesn't actually
provide a window manager.</P
><P
>There are, of course, a lot of window managers, because since
the window manager is an external component, it's (relatively) easy to
write one according to your preferences, how you want windows to look,
how you want them to behave, where do you want them to be, and so on.
Some window managers are simplistic and ugly (twm); some are flashy
and include everything but the kitchen sink (enlightenment); and
everything in between; fvwm, amiwm, icewm, windowmaker, afterstep,
sawfish, kwm, and countless others. There's a window manager for every
taste.</P
><P
>A window manager is a "meta-client", whose most basic mission is
to manage other clients. Most window managers provide a few additional
facilities (and some provide a lot of them). However one piece of
functionality that seems to be present in most window managers is a
way to launch applications. Some of them provide a command box where
you can type standard commands (which can then be used to launch
client applications). Others have a nice application launching menu of
some sort. This is not standardized, however; again, as X dictates no
policy on how a client application should be launched, this
functionality is to be implemented in client programs. While,
typically, a window manager takes on this task (and each one does it
differently), it's conceivable to have client applications whose sole
mission is to launch other client applications; think a program
launching pad. And of course, people have written large amounts of
"program launching" applications.</P
