>1. Preface</A
></H1
><P
>This document aims to provide an overview of the X Window System's
architecture, hoping to give people a better understanding of why it's
designed the way it's designed, which components integrate with X and
fit together to provide a working graphical environment and what
choices are there regarding those components.</P
><P
>We explore several concepts that get mentioned a lot but might be a
bit unclear for those without a technical background, such as widgets
and toolkits, window managers and desktop environments. Some examples
of how these components interact during day-to-day use of applications
are provided.</P
><P
>This document is, deliberately, not too technically oriented. It's
based on the author's (empirical) knowledge of the subject, and while
it's primarily meant as a non-technical introduction, it can certainly
benefit from any kind of comments, further examples and explanations,
and technical corrections. The author welcomes all questions and
comments regarding this document and can be reached at <A
