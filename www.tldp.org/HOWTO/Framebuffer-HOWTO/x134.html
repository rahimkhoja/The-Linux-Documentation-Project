>3. What advantages does framebuffer devices have?</H1
><P
>Penguin logo! :o) Seriously, the major advantage of the
			framebuffer devices is that it presents a generic
			interface across all platforms. It was the case until
			late in the 2.1.x kernel development process that the
			x86 platform had console drivers completely different
			from the other console drivers for other platforms.
			With the introduction of the 2.1.109 kernel, all this
			has changed for the better, and introduced more uniform
			handling of the console under the x86 platforms and
			also introduced true bitmapped graphical consoles
			bearing the Penguin logo on x86 for the first time, and
			allowed code to be shared across different platforms.
			Note that 2.0.x kernels do not support framebuffer
			devices, but it is possible someday someone will
			backport the code from the 2.1.x kernels to 2.0.x
			kernels.  There is an exception to that rule in that
			the 0.9.x kernel port for m68k platforms does have the
			framebuffer device support included.</P
><P
><EM
>With the release of the 2.2.x kernels,
				framebuffer device support is very solid and
				stable. You should use the framebuffer device
				if your graphic card supports it, if you are
				using 2.2.x kernels. Older 2.0.x kernels does
				not support framebuffer devices, at least on
				the x86 platform.</EM
