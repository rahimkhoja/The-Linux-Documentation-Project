<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Configuring your Linux machine as an NCP server.</A></H2>

<P>There are two packages available that allow Linux to provide the functions of
a Novell Fileserver. They both allow you to share files on your linux
machine with users using Novell NetWare client software. Users can attach and
map filesystems to appear as local drives on their machines just as they would
to a real Novell fileserver. You may want to try both to see which best
serves your intended purpose.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 The <B><EM>mars_nwe</EM></B> package.</A>
</H2>

<P>Martin Stover <CODE>&lt;mstover@freeway.de></CODE> developed <EM>mars_nwe</EM>
to enable linux to provide both file and print services for NetWare clients.
<P>In case you are wondering about the name: <EM>mars_nwe</EM> is Martin Stovers
Netware Emulator.
<P>
<H3>Capability of <B><EM>mars_nwe</EM></B>.</H3>

<P><EM>mars_nwe</EM> implements a subset of the full Novell NCP for file services,
disk based bindery and also print services. It is likely to contain bugs but
there are many people using it now and the number of bugs is steadily
decreasing as new versions are released.
<P>
<H3>Obtaining <B><EM>mars_nwe</EM></B>.</H3>

<P>You can obtain <EM>mars_nwe</EM> from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs/">ftp.gwdg.de</A>
or from
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ncpfs/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ncpfs/</A>.

<DL>
<DT><B>Build a kernel with Ethernet and IPX Support</B><DD><P>In the <CODE>1.2.13</CODE>
version kernel you need only ensure that you have answered <CODE>Y</CODE> to the
question: '<CODE>The IPX protocol</CODE>' and <CODE>N</CODE> to the question:
`<CODE>Full internal IPX network</CODE>' as illustrated:
<PRE>
 ...
 ...
The IPX protocol (CONFIG_IPX) [n] y
 ...
 ...
Full internal IPX network (CONFIG_IPX_INTERN) [N/y/?] n
 ...
 ...
</PRE>

In newer kernels a similar process is adopted but the actual text of the prompt
may have changed slightly.
<P>You will also need to ensure that you include an appropriate driver for your
Ethernet card. If you do not know how to do this then you should read the
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet-HOWTO</A>.
<P>You can then proceed to build your kernel. Make sure you remember to run
<EM>lilo</EM> to install it when you have finished.

<P>
<DT><B>Make <EM>mars_nwe</EM>.</B><DD><P>To make the package is very simple.
The first step is to simply run <CODE>make</CODE>, this will create a
<CODE>config.h</CODE> file for you. Next you should look at and edit the
<CODE>config.h</CODE> file if necessary. It allows you to configure items
such as the installation directories that will be used and the maximum
number of sessions and volumes that the server will support. The really
important entries to look at are:
<PRE>
FILENAME_NW_INI       the location of the initialisation file
PATHNAME_PROGS        where the executable support programs will be found.
PATHNAME_BINDERY      where the 'bindery' files will go.
PATHNAME_PIDFILES     the directory for the 'pid' files to be written.
MAX_CONNECTIONS       the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed.
MAX_NW_VOLS           the maximum number of volumes mars_nwe will support.
MAX_FILE_HANDLES_CONN the maximum number of open files per connection.
WITH_NAME_SPACE_CALLS if you want to support ncpfs clients.
INTERNAL_RIP_SAP      whether you want mars_nwe to provide rip/sap routing.
SHADOW_PWD            whether you use shadow passwords or not.

<P>The defaults will probably be ok but you should check anyway.

<P>will build the servers and install them in the appropriate directory. The
installation script also installs the configuration file
<CODE>/etc/nwserv.conf</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><B>Configure the server.</B><DD><P>Configuration is fairly simple. You need to
edit the <CODE>/etc/nwserv.conf</CODE> file. The format of this file may at first
look a little cryptic, but it is fairly straightforward. The file contains a
number of single line configuration items. Each line is whitespace delimited
and begins with a number that indicates the contents of the line. All
characters following a '<CODE>#</CODE>' character are considered a comment and
ignored. Martin supplies an example configuration file in the package,
but I'll present what I consider to be a simplified example to offer an
alternative for you.

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 The <B><EM>lwared</EM></B> package.</A>
</H2>

<P>Ales Dryak <CODE>&lt;A.Dryak@sh.cvut.cz></CODE> developed <EM>lwared</EM> to allow
Linux to function as an NCP based fileserver.
<P>Ales has called the package <EM>lwared</EM>, an abbreviation for <EM>LinWare
Daemon</EM>.
<P>
<H3>Capability of <B><EM>lwared</EM></B>.</H3>

<P>The <EM>lwared</EM> server is capable of providing a subset of the full
function of the Novell NCP. It incorporates messaging but it does not provide
any printing facilities at all. It does not currently work very well with
either Windows95 or Windows NT clients. The <EM>lwared</EM> server relies
on external programs to build and update the IPX routing and SAP tables.
Misbehaving clients can cause the server to crash. Importantly, filename
translation facilities have not been included.
<P>The server does work for NETX and VLM NetWare shells.
<P>
<H3>Obtaining <B><EM>lwared</EM></B></H3>

<P>The <EM>lwared</EM> package can be built for any kernel newer than
<CODE>1.2.0</CODE>, I recommend you use version <CODE>1.2.13</CODE> as no kernel
patches are required if you do. Some of the IPX functionality has changed
with the version <CODE>1.3.*</CODE> kernels and this means that patches are
now required to make it work properly. Appropriate patches are included for
the new kernels, so if you must use an alpha kernel you should still be able
to get <EM>lwared</EM> to work properly for you.
<P>You can obtain the <EM>lwared</EM> package by anonymous ftp from:
<A HREF="ftp://klokan.sh.cvut.cz/pub/linux/linware/">klokan.sh.cvut.cz</A><P>or from:
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/daemons">sunsite.unc.edu</A>

<DT><B>Build a kernel with Ethernet and IPX support</B><DD><P>If you are using an alpha <CODE>1.3.*</CODE> kernel then you should try and use
kernel version <CODE>1.3.17</CODE> or newer because the supplied patches were built
against it. <CODE>1.3.*</CODE> kernels older than <CODE>1.3.17</CODE> will require
hand patching to install. (<EM>some information on how to do this is included
in the <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> file in the package.</EM>). To install the patches
against a <CODE>1.3.17</CODE> kernel or newer you should try:
<PRE>
# make patch
</PRE>
<P>After applying the patches if necessary, the next thing you need to do is
ensure that your kernel has been built with IPX support enabled. In the
<CODE>1.2.13</CODE> version kernel you need only ensure that you have answered
<CODE>Y</CODE> to the question: '<CODE>The IPX protocol</CODE>' as 
illustrated:
<PRE>
 ...
 ...
Assume subnets are local (CONFIG_INET_SNARL) [y]
Disable NAGLE algorithm (normally enabled) (CONFIG_TCP_NAGLE_OFF) [n]
The IPX protocol (CONFIG_IPX) [n] y
*
* SCSI support
 ...

In newer kernels a similar process is adopted by the actual text of the prompt
may have changed slightly.
<P>You will also need to ensure that you include an appropriate driver for your
Ethernet card. If you do not know how to do this then you should read the
<A HREF="Ethernet-HOWTO.html">Ethernet-HOWTO</A>.

<DT><B>Compile and install <EM>lwared</EM>.</B><DD><P>To compile <EM>lwared</EM> you
should first check, edit if necessary, the <CODE>server/config.h</CODE> file. This

behave when it is running. The defaults are reasonable, though you might want
to check that the directories specified for the log files and configuration
files suit your system.

I found that the '<CODE>make depend</CODE>' complained about not finding the
<CODE>float.h</CODE> file on my system but appeared to work anyway.
I also found that when I tried compiling with gcc <CODE>2.6.3</CODE> I found
I had to change the line:

to
<PRE>
#include &lt;net/if_route.h>

in <CODE>lib/ipxkern.c</CODE> as this file changed name sometime.
<P>The '<CODE>make install</CODE>' will attempt to install the server and routing
daemon programs into your <CODE>/usr/sbin</CODE> directory, the <EM>lwpasswd</EM>
program into your <CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> directory, the IPX utility programs will
be installed into your <CODE>/sbin</CODE> directory and last but not least the
manual pages will go into the <CODE>/usr/man</CODE> directory structure. If any
of these locations are not suitable for your system then you should edit
the relevant <CODE>Makefile</CODE> and change the target directories to suit.

<P>Now the fun bit!
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Configuring the IPX network</B><DD><P>The first thing you must do is configure
your Ethernet interfaces to support the IPX networks your server will support.
To do this you will need to know the IPX network addresses for each of your
LAN segments, which Ethernet device (<CODE>eth0</CODE>, <CODE>eth1</CODE> etc.) is
on which segment, what frame type (<CODE>802.3</CODE>, <CODE>EtherII</CODE> etc.) each
LAN segment uses and what Internal Network address your server should use
(this is really needed if your server will service more than one LAN segment).
A configuration for a server that is on two dis-similar segments with IPX
network addresses <CODE>23a91300</CODE> and <CODE>23a91301</CODE> and internal network
address <CODE>bdefaced</CODE> might look like:
<PRE>
# ipx_internal_net add BDEFACED 1

# ipx_interface add eth1 etherii 23a91301
</PRE>
<P>
<DT><B>Start the routing daemons</B><DD><P>The kernel software itself actually does
the IPX packet forwarding as it does for IP, but the kernel requires additional
programs to manage the routing table updates. In the case of IPX two daemons
are needed and both are supplied with <EM>lwared</EM>: <EM>ipxripd</EM> manages
the IPX routing information and <EM>ipxsapd</EM> manages the SAP information.
To start the daemons you need only specify the location of where they should
write their log messages:
<PRE>
# ipxripd /var/adm/ipxrip
# ipxsapd /var/adm/ipxsap
</PRE>
<P>
<DT><B>Configure the <EM>lwared</EM> server</B><DD><P>There are two files that you
must manually configure to allow user login to your <EM>lwared</EM> server.
They are:
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>/etc/lwpasswd</CODE></B><DD><P>This is where LinWare user account
information is kept. The <EM>lwpasswd</EM> program is to keep it up to date.
In its simplest form the <CODE>/etc/lwpasswd</CODE> file looks like:
<PRE>
ales:
terryd:
guest:
</PRE>

Its format is a simple list of login id followed by a ':' character and then
the encrypted version of the login passwd. A couple of important caveats here:
No encrypted password means no password, LinWare users must have Linux
accounts, that is any user you place in <CODE>/etc/lwpasswd</CODE> must also
appear in <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> and <CODE>root</CODE> is the only account that can
change the password of another LinWare user. If you are logged in as
<CODE>root</CODE> you can change the password of a LinWare user as this transcript
demonstrates:
<PRE>
# lwpasswd rodg
Changing password for RODG
Enter new password: 
Re-type new password: 
Password changed.
</PRE>
<DT><B><CODE>/etc/lwvtab</CODE></B><DD><P>This is the LinWare volume tables and it stores
information about what directories should be made available to LinWare users
(this file is similar in nature to the NFS <CODE>/etc/exports</CODE> file). A
simple example of its format is as follows:
<PRE>
SYS             /lwfs/sys
DATA            /lwfs/data
HOME            /home
</PRE>

The format is simple: Volume name followed by whitespace followed by Linux
directory to export. You must have at <B>least</B> an entry for the
<CODE>SYS</CODE> volume for the server to start. If you intend your DOS based
users to be able use your LinWare server as their primary server then you must
install a standard <CODE>SYS</CODE> volume directory structure underneath the
directory you export as your <CODE>SYS</CODE> volume. Since these files are
proprietary and copyright to the Novell corporation you should have a license
for these. If you users will be using a Novell fileserver as their primary
server then this will not be necessary.

<P>
<DT><B>Start the <EM>lwared</EM> server.</B><DD><P>tada!
<PRE>
# lwared
</PRE>

It is almost an anticlimax isn't it ? Ok so you've got a question, right?
What is the fileserver name that is being advertised ? If you started the
server as shown then the LinWare server name being advertised will be
based on what is returned by the Linux <EM>hostname</EM>. If you'd like it
to be something else then you can give the server the name when you start
it, for example:
<PRE>
# lwared -nlinux00
</PRE>

would start the server with the name <CODE>linux00</CODE>.

that your LinWare server appears in an <EM>slist</EM> from a DOS client
on your network. The <EM>slist</EM> program is stored on the <CODE>SYS</CODE>
volume of a Novell fileserver so you must do this from a machine that is
already logged in somewhere. If this is not successful then check that
<EM>ipxsapd</EM> and <EM>lwared</EM> are both running. If the <EM>slist</EM>
is successful then you should try attaching to the server and mapping
a volume:
<PRE>
C:> attach linux00/ales
 ...
 ...
C:> map l:=linux00/data:
C:> l:
</PRE>

You should then be able to treat the new map just like any other map. The
file permissions you will have will be based on those allowed to the
<EM>linux</EM> account that parallels your LinWare login.
