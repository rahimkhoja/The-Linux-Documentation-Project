<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Running a Remote Window Manager</A></H2>

<P>A window manager (like <CODE>twm</CODE>, <CODE>wmaker</CODE>, or <CODE>fvwm95</CODE>) is an
application like any other.  The normal procedure should work.
<P>
<P>Well, almost.  At most one window manager can be running on a display at
any time.  If you are already running a local window manager, you cannot
start the remote one (it will complain and exit).  You have to kill
(or simply quit) the local one first.
<P>
<P>Unfortunately, many X session scripts end with an
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
exec window-manager-of-choice
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and this means that when the (local) window manager exits, your session
exits, and the X system (xdm or xinit) considers your session over and
effectively logs you out.
<P>
<P>You have to jump through a few extra hoops, but it can be done and
it's not too difficult.  Just play with your session script (normally
<CODE>~/.xsession</CODE> or <CODE>~/.xinitrc</CODE>) to get it as you want it.
<P>
<P>Beware that a window manager often provides ways to run new programs,
and that these will run on the local machine.  That is, local to where
the window manager runs.  If you run a remote window manager, it will
spawn remote applications, and this may not be what you want.  Of course,
they still display on the display that is local to you.
