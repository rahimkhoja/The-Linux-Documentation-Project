<!--
disk!BIOS access during booting
-->

When the system is booted, the BIOS reads sector 0 (known as
the MBR - the Master Boot Record) from the first disk
(or from floppy or CDROM), and jumps to the code found there - usually
some bootstrap loader.  These small bootstrap programs
found there typically have no own disk drivers and use
BIOS services.  This means that a Linux kernel can only be
booted when it is entirely located within the first 1024
cylinders, unless you both have a modern BIOS (a BIOS that supports
the Extended INT13 functions), and a modern bootloader
(a bootloader that uses these functions when available).
<P>This problem (if it is a problem) is very easily solved:
make sure that the kernel (and perhaps other files used during bootup,
such as LILO map files) are located on a partition that is entirely
contained in the first 1024 cylinders of a disk that the BIOS can access -
probably this means the first or second disk.
<P>Thus: create a small partition, say 10 MB large, so that there
is room for a handful of kernels, making sure that it is entirely
contained within the first 1024 cylinders of the first or second
disk. Mount it on <CODE>/boot</CODE> so that LILO will put its stuff there.
<P>Most systems from 1998 or later will have a modern BIOS.

<H2><A NAME="linear"></A> <A NAME="LILO"></A> <A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 LILO and the `lba32' and `linear' options</A>
</H2>

<P>Executive summary: If you use LILO as boot loader, make sure you have
LILO version 21.4 or later. (It can be found at
<A HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/boot/lilo/">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/boot/lilo/</A>.)
Always use the <CODE>lba32</CODE> option.
<P>An invocation of <CODE>/sbin/lilo</CODE> (the boot map installer) stores a list
of addresses in the boot map, so that LILO (the boot loader) knows from
where to read the kernel image. By default these addresses are
stored in (c,h,s) form, and ordinary INT13 calls are used at boot time.
<P>When the configuration file specifies <CODE>lba32</CODE> or <CODE>linear</CODE>,
linear addresses are stored. With <CODE>lba32</CODE> also linear addresses
are used at boot time, when the BIOS supports extended INT13.
With <CODE>linear</CODE>, or with an old BIOS, these linear addresses are
converted back to (c,h,s) form, and ordinary INT13 calls are used.
<P>Thus, with <CODE>lba32</CODE> there are no geometry problems and there is
no 1024 cylinder limit. Without it there is a 1024 cylinder limit.
What about the geometry?
<P>The boot loader and the BIOS must agree as to the disk geometry.
<CODE>/sbin/lilo</CODE> asks the kernel for the geometry,
but there is no guarantee that the Linux kernel geometry coincides
with what the BIOS will use. Thus, often the geometry
supplied by the kernel is worthless. In such cases it helps
to give LILO the `<CODE>linear</CODE>' option. The advantage is that
the Linux kernel idea of the geometry no longer plays a role.
The disadvantage is that <CODE>lilo</CODE> cannot warn you when
part of the kernel was stored above the 1024 cylinder limit,
and you may end up with a system that does not boot.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 A LILO bug</A>
</H2>

<P>With LILO versions below v21 there is another disadvantage:
the address conversion done at boot time has a bug: when c*H is 65536
or more, overflow occurs in the computation.
For H larger than 64 this causes a stricter limit on c than the
well-known c &lt; 1024; for example, with H=255 and an old LILO
one must have c &lt; 258. (c=cylinder where kernel image lives,
H=number of heads of disk)

</H2>

<P>Tim Williams writes: `I had my Linux partition within the first 1024
cylinders and still it wouldnt boot. First when I moved it below 1 GB
did things work.' How can that be? Well, this was a SCSI disk with
AHA2940UW controller which uses either H=64, S=32 (that is, cylinders
of 1 MiB = 1.05 MB), or H=255, S=63 (that is, cylinders of 8.2 MB),
depending on setup options in firmware and BIOS. No doubt the BIOS
assumed the former, so that the 1024 cylinder limit was found at 1 GiB,
while Linux used the latter and LILO thought that this limit was at 8.4 GB.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 No 1024 cylinder limit on old machines with IDE</A>
</H2>

<P>The <CODE>nuni</CODE> boot loader does not use BIOS services
but accesses IDE drives directly. So, one can put it on a
floppy or in the MBR and boot from anywhere on any IDE drive
(not only from the first two). Find it at
<A HREF="//metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/boot/loaders/">//metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/boot/loaders/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Other boot loaders</A>
</H2>

<P>LILO is a bit fragile, it requires the discipline of running
<CODE>/sbin/lilo</CODE> each time one installs a new kernel.
Some other boot loaders do not have this disadvantage.
Especially <CODE>grub</CODE> is popular these days; a major
disadvantage is that it does not support the
<CODE>lilo -R label</CODE> function.
