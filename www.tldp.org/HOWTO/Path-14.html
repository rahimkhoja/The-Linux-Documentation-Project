<H2><A NAME="s14">14. Some strategies to get the same path for all the users</A></H2>

<P>
<P>The most important settings is possible to set in the global shell
initialization files for login shells: /etc/csh.login for tcsh and
/etc/profile for bash.
<P>Exceptions that do not get the right path from these files are rsh
commands, ssh commands, menu items from X window manager that do not
explicitly start login shell, commands invoked from inittab, cron
jobs, daemons jobs like magic filters started from lprd, WWW CGI
scripts, and so on.
<P>If the path is set in /etc/csh.cshrc, the path is right even when rsh
or ssh execute command in remote machine with account using
tcsh/csh. However, it is not possible to set path if account uses
bash/sh.
<P>It is possible to combine path setting to one file, for example to a
file /etc/environment-common. There we write:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
${EXPORT}PATH${EQ}/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/bin:/usr/games:.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This can be used from /etc/csh.login (for tcsh and csh)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set EQ=" " set EXPORT="setenv " source /etc/environment-common
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And from /etc/profile (for bash, doesn't work for ordinary sh)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
EQ='=' EXPORT="export " . /etc/environment-common
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And from /etc/environment (for XDM)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
EQ="=" EXPORT="export " . /etc/environment-common
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This strategy works mostly but ssh will complain of the lines in
/etc/environment (and defined environment variables EQ and
EXPORT). And still, rsh commands executed with bash won't get this
path.
