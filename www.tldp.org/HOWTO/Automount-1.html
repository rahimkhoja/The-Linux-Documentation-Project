</H2>

<P>Automounting is the process where mounting and unmounting of certain
filesystems is done automatically by a daemon. If the filesystem is unmounted,
and a user attempts to access it, it will be automatically (re)mounted. This
is especially useful in large networked environments and for crossmounting
filesystems between a few machines (especially ones which are not always
online). It may also be very useful for removable devices, or a few other
uses, such as easy switching between a forced-on ascii conversion mount of
a dos filesystem and a forced-off ascii conversion mount of the same dos fs.
If you are new to Linux and dont understand what mounting and deamons are,then refer to
some documentation regarding this.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Types of automounting</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two types of automounters in linux; <EM>AMD</EM> and <EM>autofs</EM>. AMD is the
automount daemon, and supposedly works like the SunOS AMD. It is implemented in user space, meaning it's not part of the kernel. It's not necessary for the kernel to understand automounting if you NFS mount to the local host, through the AMD daemon, which routes all automount filesystem traffic through the NFS system. Autofs is a newer system assisted by the kernel, meaning that the kernel's filesystem code knows where the automount mount points are on an otherwise normal underlying fs, and the automount program takes it from there. Only autofs will be described in this mini-howto.
