>&#13;                This is an interesting topic.  When you think of a
                server you tend to think of a single machine running
                a single program.  Farming is the idea of multiple machines
                running multiple programs that all act together to
                appear to be one machine/program.
            </P

>&#13;                Why farming?  Two reasons with equal importance.  Scalability
                and Reliability.
            </P

>&#13;                Scalability is the idea of allowing something to handle
                many many more connections/transactions at the same time.
                A typcial web server can handle say 1000 connections a
                second, but 10 web servers acting together can provide
                10,000 connections per second.
            </P
><P
>&#13;                Reliability is the idea that even if a piece of the system
                goes down, the system does not.  There is no single point
                of failure, and there is built in redundancy to ensure
                that something is there to pick up the slack if something
                goes down.  In the web server example, if one web server
                goes down you could not send any connections to it until
                it is back up, thus ensuring that your web site is always
                up.
            </P
><P
>&#13;                Both of these ideas are crucial to a successful Farming
                strategy.  Each wants to push the design into a different
                direction, but they can be reconciled into a single
                design that can scale and is reliable at the same time.
