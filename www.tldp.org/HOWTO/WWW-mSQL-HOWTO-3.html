<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Hardware Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>No general statement can be made about the hardware requirements of
a database server. Too much depends on the expected number of users,
the kind of application, the network load etc. In a small environment
with only a few users and little network traffic a i486-equivalent
machine with 16 MB of RAM can be completely sufficient. Linux, the
operating system, is very efficient in terms of resources, and can
supply enough horse-power for running a broad variety of applications
at the same time. Of course, faster processors and more RAM mean more
speed, but much more important than the processor is the amount of
RAM. The more RAM the system has the less it is forced to swap
memory intensive processes to disk in case a bottleneck occurs.
<P>Given anything like 32 MB RAM and a PCI bus, searches and sorting
operations can be done without much resorting to swap files etc.,
resulting in lightening fast speed.
<P>The model installation described in this article was made on a IBM 686
(133Mhz) with 32 MB RAM and a 1.2 GB IDE hard disk.  Assuming that the
installation process starts from scratch, here is a list of the
necessary steps.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Software Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The software described in this article is available from the Internet
or from CD-ROM. The following products were used:
<UL>
<LI> Red Hat Linux PowerTools: 6 CD's Complete Easy-to-Use
Red Hat 4.2, Summer '97; alternatively from 
<CODE>http://www.redhat.com</CODE>;
</LI>
<LI> msql SQL database server: it is now available in
two versions. The versions have differences in
the number of transactions they can handle, the
administration interface, etc. The elder version,
1.0.16, is available from Sunsite mirrors. The
ELF executable can be found at
<CODE>sunsite:apps/database/sql/msql-1.0.16</CODE>
or on CD-ROM (here: disc 4 of InfoMagic Linux Developer's
Resource, 6-CD set, December 1996) or alternatively
from the following URL:
<CODE>http://www.infomagic.com</CODE>.
        
The newer version, 2.0.1, can be directly obtained
from Hughes' homepage in Australia
(<CODE>http://www.hughes.com.au</CODE>) or from numerous
mirror sites around the world;
</LI>
<LI> perl from CPAN: The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.
Walnut Creek CDROM, ISBN 1-57176-077-6, May 1997;
</LI>
<LI> Michael Schilli's CGI example program from computer
journal iX 8/1997, pages 150--152, available via ftp from 
<CODE>ftp.uni-paderborn.de:/doc/magazin/iX</CODE>;</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Installing the Operating System</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux is installed in form of the Red Hat Linux Distribution 4.2. In order
to install successfully, the machine must either have a DOS-accessible
CD-ROM drive, a bootable CD-ROM drive, or else a boot disk must be made
following the instructions on the Linux CD.
<P>During installation the user has the choice to select and configure
numerous software packages. It is convenient to select the following
items now:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> TCP/IP network support,</LI>
<LI> the http server Apache, and</LI>
<LI> the scripting language perl, and</LI>
<LI> the X Window System, as well as</LI>
<LI> the browsers Arena (graphical) and Lynx (text-based).</LI>
</UL>
<P>All these packages are provided with the Linux distribution.
If you do not install these packages now you still have the chance to
do this later with the assistance of glint, the graphical and intuitive
software package installation manager. Be sure to be root when installing
these packages.
<P>It is beyond the scope of this article to describe the network installation
and initialization procedure. Please consult the online (manpages, HTML,
texinfo) and printed (Linux Bible, etc.&nbsp;etc.) documentation.
<P>The installation procedure of Red Hat is very mature and requires only
little user attention besides the usual choices (like providing host names,
etc.). Once the installation ends successfully, the system is basically
ready to go.
<P>Installing the X Window System is not mandatory for a pure server but
it makes local access and testing much easier. The X installation procedure
is done by any of several programs; XF86Setup offers the most extensive
self-testing facilities and needs the least handling of hairy details
(like video clock programming, etc.). The only requirement is that the
software can detect the video adapter. A cheap accelerated graphics
adapter (like Trio S64 based cards prior to S64UV+) usually works
``out of the box''.
<P>At this point we assume that our system is up and running and that
Apache, Perl and the X Window System have been successfully installed.
We further assume that all standard structures like the file and
directory structure are kept as they are defined in the installation.
Last but not least we leave the host name as it is, and do at this moment
accept the name <CODE>localhost</CODE>. We'll use this name for testing
the installation; once the whole system works the true name can be added.
Please note that the network setup also requires editing the
files <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE>, among others. Ideally this should be done with
the administration tools provided to user root.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 The http Server</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The http server supplied with Linux is known as Apache to humans and
as httpd to the system. The manpage (man httpd) explains how to install
and start the http daemon (hence http<EM>d</EM>) but, as mentioned, if
the installation went without problems then the server should be running.
You can verify the directory tree: there must be a directory
<CODE>/home/httpd/</CODE> with three subdirectories: <CODE>../cgi-bin/</CODE>, 
<CODE>../html/</CODE> and <CODE>../icons/</CODE>. In <CODE>../html/</CODE> there must
be a file <CODE>index.html</CODE>. Later we will manipulate or replace this
file by our own <CODE>index.html</CODE>. All configuration information is
stored in<CODE>/etc/httpd/conf/</CODE>. The system is well preconfigured
and does not need further setup provided the installation went without
error.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 The Browsers</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are essentially three types of browsers available for Linux:
pure text-based systems like Lynx, experimental and simple ones like
Arena (free!) and commercial ones like Netscape (shareware!) with
Java support. While Lynx and Arena come with Linux, Netscape must 
be procured from other sources. Netscape is available as a precombiled
binary for Linux on ix86 architectures and will run ``out of the box''
as soon as the archive is unpacked.
<P>
<H3>Configuring Lynx</H3>

<P>
<P>Once Lynx is started it will look for a `default URL' which is usually
not very meaningful if the system does not have permanent Internet access.
In order to change the default URL (and lots of other configuration details)
the system administrator should edit <CODE>/usr/lib/lynx.cfg</CODE>. The file
is big, around 57000 bytes and contains occasionally contradicting 
information. It states its own home as <CODE>/usr/local/lib/</CODE>. Not
far from top is a line beginning with <CODE>STARTFILE</CODE>. We replace this
line by the following entry: <CODE>STARTFILE:http://localhost</CODE> and
make sure that no spacing etc.&nbsp;is inserted:
<HR>
<PRE>
# STARTFILE:http://www.nyu.edu/pages/wsn/subir/lynx.html
STARTFILE:http://localhost
</PRE>
<HR>

After saving the file, Lynx should now reveal our <CODE>index.html</CODE>
document if started without arguments.
<P>
<H3>Configuring Arena</H3>

<P>
<P>Arena first looks for its own default URL when started without arguments.
This URL is hard-wired into the executable but can be overrun by the
environment variable <CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE>. The system administrator can place
a line saying <CODE>WWW_HOME="http://localhost"</CODE> in <CODE>/etc/profile</CODE>.
The variable must then be exported, either by a separate statement
(<CODE>export WWW_HOME</CODE>) or by appending <CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> to the
existing export statement:
<HR>
<PRE>
WWW_HOME="http://localhost"
export WWW_HOME
</PRE>
<HR>

After relaunching a login shell, the new default URL is now
system-wide known to Arena.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Installing and Configuring Netscape</H3>

<P>
<P>Netscape is a commercial product and thus not included with the
Linux distributions. It is either downloadable from the
Internet or available from software collections on CDROM. Netscape
comes in form of precompiled binaries for every important hardware
platform. For installation purposes, it is useful to create a directory
<CODE>/usr/local/Netscape/</CODE> where the archive is unpacked. The files
can be kept in place (except for the Java library: follow the instructions
in the <CODE>README</CODE> file that comes with the Netscape binary), and
it is sufficient to create a soft link in <CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE> by
issuing the command
<PRE>
# ln -s /usr/local/Netscape/netscape .
</PRE>

from within <CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE>.
<P>Netscape is now ready for use and can be configured via the ``Options''
menu. In ``General Preferences'' there is a card ``Appearance'' with 
the entry ``Home Page Location''. Enter <CODE>http://localhost</CODE> here
and do not forget to save the options (via ``Options'' --- ``Save Options'')
before exiting Netscape. At the next startup, Netscape will now show
the Apache `homepage'.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Cooperation of Apache and Browsers</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You can now conduct the first real test of both the 
browser and the http server: simply start any of the available browsers
and the <CODE>Apache: Red Hat Linux Web Server</CODE> page will pop up.
This page shows the file locations and other basics of http server
installation. If this page is not displayed please check whether the
files mentioned above are in place and whether the browser configuration
is correct. Close edited configuration files before you start the browser
again. If all files are in place and the browsers seem to be configured
correctly then examine the network setup of your machine. Either the
host name is different from what was entered in the configuration, or
the network setup as such is not correct. It is utterly important
that <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> contains at least a line like
<HR>
<PRE>
127.0.0.1               localhost localhost.localdomain
</PRE>
<HR>

which implies that you can connect locally to your machine. One can
verify this by issuing any network-sensitive command requiring a host name
as argument, like <CODE>telnet localhost</CODE> (provided <CODE>telnet</CODE>
is installed). If that does not work then the network setup must be
verified before continuing with the main task.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 The Database Engine and its Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Installing the database requires only little more preparation than the
previous installation steps. There are a few SQL database engines available
with different runtime and administrative requirements, and possibly 
one of the most straightforward systems is msql, or ``Mini-SQL'' by David
Hughes. msql is shareware. Depending on the version used, commercial sites
are charged USD 250.00 and more, private users are charged USD
65.00 and more, and only educational institutions and registered
non-profit organizations can use this software free of charge.
Please note that the exact figures are provided in the licence notes
of the database documentation. The figures given here serve as a rough
indicator only.
<P>A few words are in place here why the author chose msql. First of
all, there is personal experience. While searching for a database
engine the author found msql to be about the easiest to install
and maintain, and it provides enough coverage of the SQL language
to meet general needs. Only when writing these lines, the author
discovered the following words of praise in  Alligator Descartes'
DBI FAQ (perl database interface FAQ):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From the current author's point of view, if the dataset is
relatively small, being tables of less than 1 million
rows, and less than 1000 tables in a given database, then
mSQL is a perfectly acceptable solution to your problem.
This database is extremely cheap, is wonderfully robust
and has excellent support. [...]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Msql is available in two versions now, msql-1.0.16 and msql-2.0.1,
which differ in performance (not noticeable in small scale projects)
and accompanying software (the newer version comes with more tools,
its own scripting language, etc.).  We will describe both versions
of msql since their installion differs in a few points.
<P>
<H3>Installing msql-1.0.16</H3>

<P>
<P>msql is available as source and as compiled executable with ELF support.
Using the ELF binaries makes installation easy since the archive file
<CODE>msql-1.0.16.ELF.tgz</CODE> contains a complete absolute directory tree
so that all directories are generated properly when unpacked from <CODE>/</CODE>.
<P>If you decide to compile msql-1.0.16 yourself and are going to use
the MsqlPerl package rather than the DBI interface (see a detailed
discussion on the difference between these two further down) then be
prepared that MsqlPerl might complain during the test suites that some
instruction inside msql failed. In this case a patch may be necessary
which is described in the MsqlPerl documentation (file
<CODE>patch.lost.tables</CODE>). Notably, this demands including three lines 
in <CODE>msqldb.c</CODE> after line 1400 which says <CODE> entry->def = NULL;</CODE>:
<PRE>
        *(entry->DB) = 0;
        *(entry->table) = 0;
        entry->age = 0;
</PRE>

The code fragment should now look like
<HR>
<PRE>
        freeTableDef(entry->def);
        safeFree(entry->rowBuf);
        safeFree(entry->keyBuf);
        entry->def = NULL;
        *(entry->DB) = 0;
        *(entry->table) = 0;
        entry->age = 0;
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Compiling msql involves several steps. After unpacking the source
archive, it is necessary to build a target directory. This is done
by saying
<PRE>
# make target
</PRE>

If successful, the system will then answer with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Build of target directory for Linux-2.0.30-i486 complete
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You must now change into this newly created directory and run a
<PRE>
# ./setup
</PRE>

command first. The <CODE>./</CODE> sequence is necessary to make sure
that really the command <CODE>setup</CODE> in this directory and not another
command which happens to have the same name is executed. You will
then be asked questions on the location of the source directory and
whether a root installation is desired. These questions answered,
the system should then run a number of tests checking for available
software (compilers, utilities etc.) and finally say
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Ready to build mSQL.

You may wish to check "common/site.h" although the defaults should be
fine.  When you're ready, type  "make all" to build the software
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

We say
<PRE>
# make all
</PRE>

If everything went as intended, we'll read:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Minerva/src/msql'
&lt;-- [msql] done       

Make of mSQL complete.
You should now mSQL using make install

NOTE : mSQL cannot be used free of charge at commercial sites.
       Please read the doc/License file to see what you have to do.

make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Minerva/src'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All binaries must then be made visible to the search paths by creating
soft links in <CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE>. Change to that directory and
issue the command
<PRE>
# ln -s /usr/local/Minerva/bin/* .
</PRE>

after which the links will be properly set.
<P>
<H3>Testing msql-1</H3>

<P>
<P>After the installation it is now possible to test whether the database
works. Before anything else is done, the server daemon must be started. 
The system administrator holding root privileges issues the command
<PRE>
# msqld &amp;
</PRE>

(do not forget to add the <CODE>&amp;</CODE>, otherwise msql won't run in
the background.) after which the following screen message appears:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mSQL Server 1.0.16 starting ...

Warning : Couldn't open ACL file: No such file or directory
Without an ACL file global access is Read/Write
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This message tells us that everything so far worked since we did
not set up any access restrictions. For the moment it is sufficient
to start the msql daemon from within a shell but later we may want
to have the system startup automatically execute this command for us.
The command must then be mentioned in a suitable <CODE>rc.d</CODE> script.
Only now the administrator can issue the first genuine database command:
<PRE>
# msqladmin create inventur
</PRE>

msql replies by saying <CODE>Database "inventur" created.</CODE>. As a further
proof, we find that the directory <CODE>/usr/local/Minerva/msqldb/</CODE>
contains now the empty subdirectory <CODE>../inventur/</CODE>. We could
manipulate the newly created database with the administration tools;
these procedures are all covered in detail in the msql documentation.
<P>
<H3>Installing msql-2.0.1</H3>

<P>
<P>There is now a newer, more powerful version of Hughes' mSQL server available
the installation of which is different in a few points. Installing msql-2
from scratch involves the following steps. Copy the archive to your
extraction point, e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp; <CODE>/usr/local/msql-2/</CODE>, then untar the archive:
<PRE>
# tar xfvz msql-2.0.1.tar.gz 
</PRE>
<P>Change to the root direction of the install tree and issue a 
<PRE>
# make target
</PRE>
<P>Change to <CODE>targets</CODE> and look for your machine type. There should
be a new subdirectory <CODE>Linux-</CODE><I>(your version)-(your cpu)/</I>.
Change to that directory and start the setup facility located here:
<PRE>
# ./setup
</PRE>
<P>There is also a file <CODE>site.mm</CODE> which can be edited. Maybe you
have got used to the directory name <CODE>/usr/local/Minerva/</CODE> and
want to preserve it? In this case change the <CODE>INST_DIR=...</CODE>
line to your desired target directory. Otherwise, leave everything as 
it is.
<P>Now you can start building the database:
<PRE>
# make
# make install
</PRE>
<P>
<P>If everything went successfully, we'll see a message like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[...]

**   This is the commercial, production release of mSQL-2.0
**   Please see the README file in the top directory of the
**   distribution for license information.
*********
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After all is installed properly we have to take care of the
administration details. Here, the real differences from msql-1
begin. First, a user <CODE>msql</CODE> is created which is responsible for
database administration.
<P>
<PRE>
# adduser msql
</PRE>
<P>
<P>Then we have to change all ownerships in the mSQL directory to
<CODE>msql</CODE>
by saying:
<PRE>
# cd /usr/local/Minerva
# chown -R msql:msql *
</PRE>
<P>
<P>Then we create soft links for all database binaries in
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE>
by saying:
<PRE>
# ln -s /usr/local/Minerva/bin/* .
</PRE>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Testing msql-2</H3>

<P>We can now start the database server by issuing the command
<CODE>msql2d &amp;</CODE> and should get a response similar to this one:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That looks perfect. The database is compiled and in place, and we
can now continue with the perl modules since these rely partially
on the presence of a working database server for testing.
<P>Accidentally, this is also a good moment to print the complete
manual that comes with msql-2.0.1:
<PRE>
# gzip -d manual.ps.gz
# lpr manual.ps
</PRE>
<P>We can proceed to building the interfaces now, but it is a good idea
to keep the newly created SQL server up and running since that makes
testing the interface libraries somewhat simpler.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Choice of Interfaces: DBI/mSQL, MsqlPerl, and Lite</A>
</H2>

<P>A frequently quoted saying in the Camel Book (the authorative perl
documentation) states that there is more than one way to achieve a
result when using perl. This, alas, holds true for our model
application, too. Basically there are three ways to access an msql
database via CGI. First of all the question is whether or not perl
shall be used. If we use perl (on which this article focuses) then
we still have the choice between two completely different interface
models. Besides using perl, we can also employ msql's own scripting
language, called Lite, which is reasonably simple and a close
clone of C.
<P>
<H3>DBI and DBD-mSQL</H3>

<P>By the time of this writing, using perl's generic database interface
called DBI is the method of choice. DBI has a few advantages: It
provides unified access control to a number of commercial databases
with a single command set. The actual database in use on a given system
is then contacted through a driver which effectively hides the
pecularities of that database from the programmer. Being such, using
DBI provides for a smooth transition between different databases by
different makers. In one single script it is even possible to contact
several different databases. Please refer to the DBI-FAQ for details.
There is, however, one drawback: The DBI interface is still under
development and shows rapidly galloping version numbers (sometimes
with updates taking place within less than a month). Similarly, the
individual database drivers are also frequently updated and may
rely on specific versions of the database interface. Users making
first-time installations should stick to the version numbers given
in this article since other versions may cause compilation and
testing problems the trouble shooting of which is nothing for the
faint-hearted.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>MsqlPerl</H3>

<P>MsqlPerl is a library for directly accessing msql from perl scripts.
It bypasses the DBI interface and is fairly compact. Though it works
fine with both versions of msql, its usage is not promoted anymore
in favour of the generalized DBI interface. Nonetheless, in a given
installation it may prove to be the interface of choice since it is
small and easy to install. Notably, it has less version dependencies
than revealed by the interaction of DBI and particular database
drivers.
<P>
<H3>msql's own scripting language: Lite</H3>

<P>Last but not least msql-2 comes with its own scripting language:
Lite. The language is a close relative of C stripped of its oddities
with additional shell-like features (in a way, something like a very
specialized version of perl). Lite is a simple language and is well
documented in the msql-2 manual. The msql-2 package also comes with
a sample application sporting Lite.
<P>We will not describe Lite here because it is well documented but
fairly specific to msql-2, and because it is assumed that the readers
of this article have a basic interest in and a basic understanding
of perl.  Nonetheless it is highly recommended to have a closer look
at Lite: it may well be the case that Lite offers the solution of
choice in an exclusive msql-2 environment (implying no other
databases are involved) due to its simplicity and straightforward 
concept.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.9">3.9 Going the generic way: DBI and DBD-msql</A>
</H2>

<P>We assume that perl was installed during the system setup or via the
package manager mentioned above. No further details will be given here.
Nonetheless we first test whether our version of perl is up to date:
<P>
<PRE>
# perl -v
</PRE>
<P>perl should respond with the following message:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

[...]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

So far, everything is fine. The next step includes installing the
perl libraries for databases in general (DBI), the msql driver
(DBD-mSQL) and CGI. The CGI driver is necessary in any case.
The following archives are necessary:
<OL>
<LI> DBI-0.81.tar.gz</LI>
<LI> DBD-mSQL-0.65.tar.gz</LI>
<LI> CGI.pm-2.31.tar.gz (or higher)</LI>
</OL>
<P>A caveat is necessary here for beginners: the test installation
described here works fine using software with <EM>exactly</EM> these
version numbers, and combinations of other versions failed in one or
the other way. Debugging flawed version combinations is nothing for
those who are not very familiar with the intimate details of the
calling conventions etc. of the interfaces. Sometimes only a method
is renamed while performing the same task, but sometimes the internal
structure changes significantly. So, again, stick with these version
numbers if you want to be on the safe side even if you discover that
version numbers have increased in the meantime. Frequent updates of
these interfaces are the rule rather than the exception, so you should
really anticipate problems when installing other versions than those
indicated here.
<P>It is very important that the database driver for mSQL (DBD-mSQL)
is installed <EM>after</EM> the generic interface DBI.
<P>We start by creating the directory <CODE>/usr/local/PerlModules/</CODE> as 
it is very important to keep the original perl directory tree untouched.
We could also choose a different directory name since the name is completely
uncritical, and unfortunately that is not really mentioned in the README
files of the verious perl modules.  Having copied the above-mentioned
archives to <CODE>/usr/local/PerlModules/</CODE> we unpack them saying
<PRE>
# tar xzvf [archive-file]
</PRE>
<P>for every single of the three archives. Do not forget to supply the
real archive name to <CODE>tar</CODE>. The installation process
for the three modules is essentially stardardized; only the screen
messages showing important steps of individual packages are
reproduced here.
<P>
<H3>Installing perl's Database Interface DBI</H3>

<P>
<P>The database interface must always be installed before installing 
the specific database driver.  Unpacking the DBI archive creates
the directory <CODE>/usr/local/PerlModules/DBI-0.81/</CODE>. Change to
that directory.  There are a <CODE>README</CODE> file (you should read
it) and a perl-specific makefile. Now issue the command
<PRE>
# perl Makefile.PL

This looks good, as the program says, and we can proceed with the
next step:

If no error message occurs (the detailed protocol dumped on screen
is <EM>not</EM> an error message) we test the newly installed library
with the command
<PRE>
# make test

The final step is to install all files in their proper directories. The
following command will take care of it:
<PRE>
# make install
</PRE>

No more duties are left. If for some reason the installation failed and
you want to redo it do not forget to issue 
<PRE>
# make realclean
</PRE>

first. This will remove stale leftovers of the previous installation.
You can also remove the files which were installed by copying the 
screen contents (shown abbreviated)

into a file, replacing every <CODE>Installing</CODE> with <CODE>rm</CODE>. Provided
you named the file <CODE>uninstall</CODE> you can then say

which will remove the recently installed files.

<H3>perl's msql Driver DBD-mSQL</H3>

<P>
<P>The msql driver can only be installed <EM>after</EM> a successful installation
of perl's generic database interface.
<P>The basic steps are the same as above; so first go through
<PRE>
# perl Makefile.PL
</PRE>
<P>Here, the system should answer with an urgent warning to read the
accompanying documentation. It will then detect where msql resides,
and asks which version you use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

$MSQL_HOME not defined. Searching for mSQL...
Using mSQL in /usr/local/Hughes

 -> Which version of mSQL are you using [1/2]? 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

State your correct version number. Quite a few lines of text will
follow. Watch for the following ones:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Splendid! Your mSQL daemon is running. We can auto-detect your configuration!

I've auto-detected your configuration to be running on port: 1114
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can now test the driver by saying
<PRE>
# make test
</PRE>

Again, a lengthy output follows. If it ends with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Testing: $cursor->func( '_ListSelectedFields' ). This will fail.
        ok: not a SELECT in msqlListSelectedFields!
Re-testing: $dbh->do( 'DROP TABLE testaa' )
        ok
*** Testing of DBD::mSQL complete! You appear to be normal! ***
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

you are on the safe side of life and can install your driver by
saying
<PRE>
# make install
</PRE>

You are now ready to go and can skip the next paragraph.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.10">3.10 The MsqlPerl Interface</A>
</H2>

<P>If you decide to use the exclusive MsqlPerl interface then no generic
database driver is needed, only <CODE>MsqlPerl-1.15.tar.gz</CODE>, since,
as mentioned earlier, MsqlPerl provides a direct interface between
perl and the database server without using the DBI interface.
Installing and testing is straightforward.
<P>After saying <CODE>perl Makefile.PL</CODE> the make utility can be started.
First you have to answer the question where mSQL resides. If it
resides in <CODE>/usr/local/Minerva/</CODE> the default answer can be confirmed.
<P>Then do a <CODE>make test</CODE>. Before doing so you must ensure that you
have a database named <CODE>test</CODE> and that you have read and write 
permissions for it. This can be done by
<PRE>
# msqladmin create test
</PRE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.11">3.11 perl's CGI library</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Installing perl's CGI part is the simpliest of the three steps.
Execute the following commands in the given order and everything
is done:
<P>
<PRE>
# perl Makefile.PL
# make 
# make install
</PRE>
<P>
<P>Unlike the previous drivers this interface does not have a test
option (<CODE># make test</CODE>) whereas the other modules <EM>should</EM>
be tested in any case.
<P>A subdirectory with CGI example scripts is also created. You can
copy the contents of this directory into <CODE>/home/http/cgi-bin/</CODE>
and use the browser to experiment with the scripts.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.12">3.12 Installation Checklist</A>
</H2>

<P>We went through the following steps, in this order:
<OL>
<LI> Install Linux with networking support</LI>
<LI> Install a http server, e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;Apache</LI>
<LI> Install a browser, e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;Arena, lynx or Netscape</LI>
<LI> Install an SQL server, e.&nbsp;g.&nbsp;msql</LI>
<LI> Install a suitable perl SQL interface</LI>
<LI> Install the CGI files</LI>
</OL>
<P>Finally, you can do some clean-up. All source trees for msql and
the perl modules can be safely deleted (however, you should not
delete your archive files!) since the binaries and documentation
are now based in different directories.
