<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Help! (sigh)</A></H2>

<P>Well, you need help - isn't :) ... hmm .. i could be sarcastic and just say
"you could better do it again, 'coz it looks a messy enuf" - or .. i could
help ... - I wrote down some common problems - IF you got any problem NOT
listed in this HOWTO (section) - then mail me - and i'll put it in this howto
even with your name/email addr in it :). **BEFORE** mailing to me - please
look if you didn't forgot anything - and IF you want some help from me - send
me the MOST DETAILED information - included the scripts &amp; things you needed.
i DON'T need any binaries - since i won't run them.
<P>

</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 What do you mean by "anonymous mailserver"?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Well, you could make accounts like "anon0001@yourdom.dom" - and forward
it to another email address ... nobody needs to read the .procmailrc
file, so YOU ONLY know the address !.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 My cat died</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Well, next time don't print this HOWTO out on 200 gram papers, since it
are 10 pages it would be 2KG for the cat - it is JUST TOO HEAVY !</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 My dog died</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>hmm - can't do anything about that one - why askin' me ? ...
Just bury it ....</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 Linux?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A free-unix - posix compatible - made by Linus Torvalds ... Why are you
reading this if you even don't know what Linux is ?</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 Can you help me with finding a mail account?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>No! - this is a howto for YOUR side, i don't care about the side of
your isp, nor how to get your email address. </LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 Why is the "maybe later i'll make some addition ..." removed ?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Read point 5.5 very carefully :) and you'll see why .. it's 'coz i
needed to add it on general request :)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 How do i get a "domain" ?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ask your local ISP/provider - he will help you with it. It could take
days/ even weeks when asking to the Internic - your provider can help.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 Why are you so f*cking lame using this?</A>
</H2>

lame USING it - i *AM* using it - so why bother?</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.10">6.10 Nosuchuserfile?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>

the original writer knows what happened with his "never delivered" mail.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.11">6.11 Can my users write/send mail too?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>This has nothing to do with the system i explained to you, read the
sendmail manual ... - this is to RECEIVE mail - to be "always available
at an email address".</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.12">6.12 Does every user need a shell account at my server?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Nope .. - but - it will be really hard for users not having internet
access :) ... You could have a masq'd network - and use a computer
connected to it - so the users can get their mail that way, or you can
generate a link between a bulletin board and his mail, you could even
forward it to a fidonet gate :) ... reasons enough not to give a shell!.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.13">6.13 skeletion?</A>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>i know it is a typo - but - i like this word better.</LI>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>No questions - for automation - you better be sure about what you are
going to do ... since - it COULD be a trojan ya know :))) (it isn't but
what means you need to know what scripting is before asking questions)
It IS easy enough to interprete - that's even why i put the comments
with it. *IF* you are going to distribute this script - leave my
Copyright in it please ! thanks :).</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.15">6.15 Why are you so cruel?</A>

universe ! NOW SCRAM! (i just want to be complete in my HOWTO, and not
TOO much "drifting away" from my original point in the doc - so :) that's
all).</LI>
