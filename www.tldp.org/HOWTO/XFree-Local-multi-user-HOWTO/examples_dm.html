[servers]

# Note the VTAllocation and FirstVT keys on Linux.  Don't add any vt&#60;number&#62;
# arguments if VTAllocation is on, and set FirstVT to be the first vt
# available that your gettys don't grab (gettys are usually dumb and grab
# even a vt that has already been taken).  Using 7 will work pretty much for
# all Linux distributions.  VTAllocation is not currently implemented on
# anything but Linux since I don't own any non-Linux systems.  Feel free to
# send patches.  X servers will just not get any extra arguments then.
#
#Note: If you want to run an X terminal you could add an X server such as this
#0=Terminal -query serverhostname
# or for a chooser (optionally serverhostname could be localhost)
#0=Terminal -indirect serverhostname
