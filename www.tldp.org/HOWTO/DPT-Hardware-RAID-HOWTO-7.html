<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Troubleshooting</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Upon bootup, no SCSI hosts are detected</A>
</H2>

<P> This could be due to several reasons, but it's probably because
the appropriate driver is not configured in the kernel. Check and make
sure the appropriate driver (EATA-DMA or EATA ISA/EISA/PCI for most
DPT cards) is configured. 
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 RAID configuration shows up as N different disks</A>
</H2>

<P> The RAID has not been configured properly.  If you're using a DPT
storage manager, you need to configure the RAID disks as a single
logical array.  Michael Neuffer (
<A HREF="mailto:neuffer@uni-mainz.de">neuffer@uni-mainz.de</A>) writes: "When you configure
the controller with the SM start it with the parameter /FW0 and/or
select Solaris as OS. This will cause the array setup to be managed
internally by the controller." 
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Machine/controller is shut down in the middle of a format</A>
</H2>

<P> As stated in the DPT manual, this is clearly a no-no and might
require the disks to be returned to the manufacturer, since the DPT
Storage Manager might not be able format it. However, you might be
able to perform a low level format on it, using a program supplied by
DPT, called clfmt in their utilities page. Read the
instructions after unzipping the clfmt.zip file on how to use it (and
use it wisely). Once you do the low level format, you might be able to
treat the disks like new. Use this program carefully!  
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 SCSI_ABORT_BUSY errors produced during initial filesystem format</A>
</H2>

<P> When you do a <CODE>mke2fs</CODE> on the SCSI drive, you may see errors
of the form:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
scsi: aborting command due to timeout : pid xxx, scsi0, channel 0, id
2, lun 0
write (10) xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
eata_abort called pid xxx target: 2 lun: 0 reason: 3
Returning: SCSI_ABORT_BUSY
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and this might end up causing the machine to freeze.  I (and many
others) have been able to fix this problem by simply reading one or
two hundred MB from the RAID array with <CODE>dd</CODE> like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=128
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P> During a format, a fast rush of requests for chunks of memory that
is directly accessible is made, and sometimes the memory manager
cannot deliver it on time anymore.  The <CODE>dd</CODE> is a workaround
that will simply create the requests sequentially instead of one huge
heap at once like the format tends to create it. 
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 If all fails...</A>
</H2>

<P> Read the SCSI-HOWTO again.  Check the cabling and the termination.
Try a different machine if you have access to one.  The most common
cause of problems with SCSI devices and drivers is because of faulty
or misconfigured hardware.  Finally, you can post to the various
newsgroups or e-mail me, and I'll do my best to get back to you.
