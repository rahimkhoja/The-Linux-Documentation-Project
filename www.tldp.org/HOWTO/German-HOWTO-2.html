<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux German Howto explains how to enable German specific features for
Linux applications as well as for the Linux system. But what is German
specific? If you have been to the worlds largest computer exhibition CeBIT
in Hannover, you may consider traditional leather costumes, white sausages,
(real!) beer and perfectely ironed underwear to be typical for
germany. Please beg my pardon that I can't comment on the underwear part or
else this Howto would at least get a R-rating, which would trigger
questions about distribution restrictions and their impacts for free
software and OpenSource and OpenDocumentation and so on. In the end we will
surely have an OpenRating as well. Pure horror.
<P>Regarding the other three points about germany mentioned above, these are
correct as you may already have figured out yourself.  Believe me, I'm just
wearing such a traditional costume while typing the text in front of his
computer. Everybody does all the time. Even my computer wears a leather
costume, or else it would not be germany! Built into the leather case is a
sound microprocessor to turn the simple PC-beep into an original south
german yodel. Can you already see the alp mountains?
<P>So what else is german specific? Maybe your friendly stewardess told you
the waiter at a restaurant &quot;is not offensive but doing regular
service to you&quot; before your plane arrived at the german airport.
Cultures clashing into each other. Of course the waiter is doing his best,
but at least the americans are not willing to understand. Example: In my
home town the waiters are employed to serve the beer. This is a fundamental
different concept than just aiming at bloody customer satisfaction. It
counts that the beer can flow down your throat in a fresh state. The beer
must be satisfied. Think of it as a religious believe. Next time the
american president secretly visits me, I will explain and show him all the
details. Promised.
<P>Also quite typical for German are long words and long sentences. Example:
The German translation of Howto is Sowirdsgemacht. More than double as
long. My words are longer than yours. Ha! We can even go for extremes like
in
Dampfschifffahrtspensionskassenchefsekret&auml;rinnenhalbjahresbetriebsausflugsbudget.
The typsetter will surely hate me for using such a long word. D78g, now
all-together: Nyia-hahaha. As you can imagine, most applications will die
because of string buffer overflows when german users start to type in their
unusal long words. That is what the German Howto is about.
<P>Not to forget our German speaking friends at the south: Austria and
Switzerland. Read this Howto and learn how to manage your secret swiss
bank account from within Linux. Making money fast is twice as much fun then.
<P>Well, before I completely destroy the image of over-serious germans, lets
come to the point. Linux is developed by a world wide community of hackers
on the internet. Their least common denominator for communication is
English and that works quite acceptable. The situation for users is
different. In order to do their work, they have to use the native language
and the specifics of their country. Examples: characters, time zones and
numbering conventions. Luckily Linux is so widespread, that national
markets have already become a target for Linux distributions. In other
words, most adaptions are already built in. In this context the KDE project
should be mentioned, as it surely has set milestones for the amount, ease
and completeness of internationalization in applications.  The German Howto
honors this evolution by concentrating on basic knowledge instead of
endless parameter listings.
<P>The English part of the Howto is much shorter than the German one. It is
only inteded as an overview of the situation.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Availability</A>
</H2>

<P>Linux Howtos fill the gap between books and short readme files. They
explain one subject in a detailed fashion. To fullfill this goal, the Linux Documentation Project (LDP) has created a
infrastructure consisting of authors, tools and distribution channels. The
Linux German Howto is part of the LDP and thus available like all other
Howtos. Either on the 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">LDP homepage</A> or under the directory /usr/share/doc/howto/ on a typical Linux
installation. Printed collections of Howtos published by various companies
are available at your local bookstore.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Linux in German speaking countries</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This is a small list of Linux portals, which are maintained and updated frequently:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.linux.at/">Linux in &Ouml;sterreich</A><P>
<A HREF="http://www.linux.ch/">Linux in der Schweiz</A><P>
<A HREF="http://www.linux.de/">Linux.de</A><P>
<A HREF="http://www.pro-linux.de/">Pro Linux</A><P>A large number of local Linux User Groups exists in Austria, Germany and
Switzerland. You can find them in the directories of most German Linux Portals.
Country wide associations are the 
<A HREF="http://www.linux-verband.de/">Linux-Verband</A>, which aims more at commercial members, and the 
<A HREF="http://www.guug.de/">German Unix User Group</A> (GUUG), which aims
at system administrators. Three large conventions are held each year, the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</A> (LinuxDay), the
<A HREF="http://www.linux-kongress.de">Linux-Kongress</A> and the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxworldexpo.de">LinuxWorld Expo</A>. Local
events are usally organised by the Linux User Groups and can be found in
the calendars. The newsgroup hierarchy de.comp.os.unix.linux.* is a quite
busy part of the german usenet. The same is true for the IRC channels
#debian.de and #linuxger.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Characters</H3>

<P>The traditional character sets for central europe are ISO-8859-1 and
ISO-8859-15 (including the euro symbol). Please see the german part of this
Howto for an excerpt of ISO-8859-15. Unicode covers both sets, but only
few users have applications with full support for unicode. That may change
in the future.
<P>Conversions of the character sets have also be done when exchanging texts
between Unix/Linux, Macintoshs and DOS/Windows systems. It is not enough to
just convert the line endings. This is also true for printing; most
printers expect the DOS-style text format. (When printing from word
processors and such, high quality binary bitmaps are sent to the printer,
which are not affected by character set and line ending problems.)
<P>Quite annoying is the fact that y and z are exchanged compared to an
english keyboard. Not to speak of the special characters like the
slash. Now imagine you want to type yes and it always gives zes. Or you
want to type /dev/sda and it gives ?dev?sda. Short: a keyboard mapping is
required in europe. Every european country has its own keyboard layout. The
right mapping can be choosen at installation time for all modern Linux
distributions. Suitable for germany and austria is de-latin1-nodeadkeys,
whereas the swiss people need sf-latin1 (swiss-french) or sg-latin1
(swiss-german).
<P>Please keep in mind that the loadkeys command only helps for a properly
started system. To have the correct mapping even for the Lilo boot prompt,
you have to create a key mapping with keytab-lilo.pl and configure Lilo
to use that mapping.
<P>The character set ISO-8859-1 shares the first 128 characters with
US-ASCII and defines another 128 characters on top of it. To type in all
these characters on the keyboard, it would be necassary to map up to four
symbols per key. For cases where you access the complete set only
occasionally,such a mapping would be a too high learning effort.
One solution is the use of the compose key. After pressing the compose key,
which is usally mapped to the right control key, the next character is not
displayed but instead printed over the following character. Example:
the sequence Right-Ctrl &nbsp; A is composed as the character &Atilde; (capital a with
a tilde on top).
<P>An alternative is the feature of always composing keys. Under such
mappings, characters like &nbsp; are never displayed but always printed over the
following character. Usally this feature is refered to as dead keys, which
is a little bit misleading. I'm not aware of anybody using the dead keys
feature.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Currency</H3>

<P>On january 1st 2002, the last step of the currency union in europe was
performed. Since then the currency is euro and its fraction is
cent. Although there is a special currency symbol in ISO-8859-15 and in
unicode, you can safely use the ISO currency code EUR for euro as you used
ATS for austrian schillings or DEM for deutsche marks before. Please note
that switzerland (CHF, swiss francs) is not part of the european union.
<P>
<P>
<H3>XFree86</H3>

<P>There is nothing special about XFree86 for German users. Howevery, several
hardware manufactures asked me for the correct setting, which is why I'm
citing them here.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Time zone</A>
</H2>

<P>The time zones for central europe are CET (Central European Time) and CEST
(Central European Summer Time) respectively. However, system administrators
are expected to use one of the aliases Europe/Berlin, Europe/Vienna or
Europe/Zurich. This gives correct results even before the Unix Epoch.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Internationalization and lokalization</H3>

<P>Internationalization and lokalization are unusal long words (but not as
long as D78g, see above) and thus abreviated by i18n and i10n. The numbers
indicate how many characters have been left out.
<P>I18n denotes the changes to the program code in order to have a multi
lingual output. A common implementation is to seperate the messages from the
code. This way several translated texts share the same code base. German
messages are activated with the LANG environment variable. Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#LANG=de_AT  # for austria
#LANG=de_CH  # for switzerland (German)
LANG=de_DE   # for germany
export LANG
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The result is not always satisfying, because not all applications and
libraries are internationalized. It may happen that German and English
messages are mixed like in the following example, which also illustrates
the evolution of the problem:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# in 1997:
tar: Kann Archiv 'foo.tgz' nicht &ouml;ffnen: Permission denied

# in 2001:
tar: foo.tgz: Cannot open: Keine Berechtigung
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>German messages alone don't make much sense. Applications must also display
the data using the correct format. Example: 08.07.2001 instead of 07.08.2001
or EUR 10.000,32 instead of EUR 10,000.32. You get the idea. The required
changes to the programm are denoted as i10n. Today the LANG variable also
activates the associated locale.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Paper size</H3>

<P>The standard paper size in europe is DIN A4, which is a little bit smaller
and taller than US-letter. The aspect ratio of height vs. width is the
square root of two. All sizes are derived from A0 by a centered cut at the
longer side.
