Here's an easy game to play,
Here's an easy thing to say:

If a packet hits a pocket
 on a socket on a port
And the bus is interrupted
  as a very last resort,
And the address of the memory
  makes your floppy disk abort,
Then the socket packet pocket
  has an error to report!!

If your cursor finds a menu item
  followed by a dash,
And the double clicking icon puts  your
  window in the trash,
And your data is corrupted 'cause the
  index doesn't hash,
Then the situation's hopeless, and your 
  system's gonna crash!

YOU CAN'T SAY THIS? WHAT A SHAME SIR!
WE'LL FIND ANOTHER GAME SIR

If the label on the cable on the table
  at your house,
Says the network is connected to
  the button on your mouse,
But your packets want to tunnel
  on another protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected 
  by the printer down the hall,
And your screen is all distorted
  by the side effects of gauss
So your icons in the window are
  as wavy as a souse,
Then you  may as well reboot and
  go out with a bang,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet,
  the sucker's gonna hang!
When the copy of your floppy's
  getting sloppy on the disk
And the microcode instructions cause
 unnecessary risc,
Then you have to flash your memory and
  you'll want to RAM your  ROM
Quickly turn off your computer and
  be sure  to tell your mom!
