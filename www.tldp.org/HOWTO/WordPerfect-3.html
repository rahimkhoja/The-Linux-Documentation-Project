<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Impressions of 7.0</A>
</H2>

<P>I have been very impressed with the operation of WordPerfect 7.0 for 
Linux.  I only recently downloaded it and tried it.  It looks like
WP 7.0 for Windows.  The features appear to work properly.  I especially
like the spell-as-you-go feature!
<P>The HTML publisher works a little better than that on WP 6.0, but still
has some bugs.  Someone reported that WP 7.0 requires a lot of 
swap space (I have not tested it at this time).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Getting WordPerfect 7.0</A>
</H2>

<P>WP 7.0 is available as several LARGE tarballs from sdcorp's FTP
site (or via the WWW).  I tried for two days to download the 26MB
archive using ISDN but only was able to get part of the file.  I 
eventually had to use a commercial account with a T1 to
the Internet to get the files.  It would be much easier to download
if each tarball was split into several smaller files (1-2 MB in size). 
Note, when you uncompress the tarballs, the result is a small number
of medium sized files -- just what is needed.
<P>The current version that you can download is time limited to 15 days.
During this time, you can pay them and they will give you a license 
for it.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Installation of 7.0</A>
</H2>

<P>To install, you must extract the tarballs, run the <B>Runme</B> program,
answer some questions and then run xwp to start WP 7.0.  Note, you need
58 MB just for WP 7.0, prior to the manuals, graphics, etc.
