<H1>Software-RAID HOWTO</H1>

<EM>RAID stands for ''Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks'', and
is meant to be a way of creating a fast and reliable disk-drive
subsystem out of individual disks.  RAID can guard against disk failure, and can also improve performance over that of a single disk drive.
This document is a tutorial/HOWTO/FAQ for users of
the Linux MD kernel extension, the associated tools, and their use.
The MD extension implements RAID-0 (striping), RAID-1 (mirroring),
RAID-4 and RAID-5 in software. That is, with MD, no special hardware
or disk controllers are required to get many of the benefits of RAID.</EM>

<P><B>RAID, although designed to improve system reliability by adding
redundancy, can also lead to a false sense of security and confidence 
when used improperly.  This false confidence can lead to even greater 
disasters.  In particular, note that RAID is designed to protect against
*disk* failures, and not against *power* failures or *operator*
mistakes.  Power failures, buggy development kernels, or operator/admin
errors can lead to damaged data that it is not recoverable!
RAID is *not* a substitute for proper backup of your system.
Know what you are doing, test, be knowledgeable and aware!</B>
