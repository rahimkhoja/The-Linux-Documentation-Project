<LI><B>Q</B>:
I have SCSI adapter brand XYZ (with or without several channels), 
and disk brand(s) PQR and LMN, will these work with md to create
a linear/stripped/mirrored personality? 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
Yes!  Software RAID will work with any disk controller (IDE
or SCSI) and any disks.  The disks do not have to be identical,
nor do the controllers.  For example, a RAID mirror can be
created with one half the mirror being a SCSI disk, and the 
other an IDE disk.  The disks do not even have to be the same 
size.  There are no restrictions on the mixing &amp; matching of 
disks and controllers.
      
<P>This is because Software RAID works with disk partitions, not 
with the raw disks themselves.  The only recommendation is that
for RAID levels 1 and 5, the disk partitions that are used as part 
of the same set be the same size. If the partitions used to make 
up the RAID 1 or 5 array are not the same size, then the excess 
space in the larger partitions is wasted (not used).

I have a twin channel BT-952, and the box states that it supports 
hardware RAID 0, 1 and 0+1.   I have made a RAID set with two 
drives, the card apparently recognizes them when it's doing it's 
BIOS startup routine. I've been reading in the driver source code, 
but found no reference to the hardware RAID support.  Anybody out 
there working on that?

The Mylex/BusLogic FlashPoint boards with RAIDPlus are
actually software RAID, not hardware RAID at all.  RAIDPlus 
is only supported on Windows 95 and Windows NT, not on 
Netware or any of the Unix platforms.  Aside from booting and
configuration, the RAID support is actually in the OS drivers.

<P>While in theory Linux support for RAIDPlus is possible, the
implementation of RAID-0/1/4/5 in the Linux kernel is much 
more flexible and should have superior performance, so 
there's little reason to support RAIDPlus directly.

I want to run RAID with an SMP box.  Is  RAID SMP-safe?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>A</B>:
"I think so" is the best answer available at the time I write
this (April 98).  A number of users report that they have been 
using RAID with SMP for nearly a year, without problems.  
However, as of April 98 (circa kernel 2.1.9x), the following 
problems have been noted on the mailing list:
<UL>
<LI>Adaptec AIC7xxx SCSI drivers are not SMP safe
(General note: Adaptec adapters have a long 
&amp; lengthly history
of problems &amp; flakiness in general.  Although
they seem to be the most easily available, widespread
and cheapest SCSI adapters, they should be avoided.
After factoring for time lost, frustration, and
corrupted data, Adaptec's will prove to be the
costliest mistake you'll ever make. That said,
if you have SMP problems with 2.1.88, try the patch
ftp://ftp.bero-online.ml.org/pub/linux/aic7xxx-5.0.7-linux21.tar.gz
I am not sure if this patch has been pulled into later 
2.1.x kernels.
For further info, take a look at the mail archives for
March 98 at
http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-raid/lr_9803_01/
As usual, due to the rapidly changing nature of the 
latest experimental 2.1.x kernels, the problems
described in these mailing lists may or may not have
been fixed by the time your read this. Caveat Emptor.
