>&#13;  This HOWTO describes how to use the Cryptoloop loop device encryption in the 2.6 Linux kernel series. Cryptoloop
  makes it possible to create encrypted file systems within a partition or another file in the file system. These encrypted files
  can the be moved to a CD, DVD, USB memory stick, etc. Cryptoloop makes
  use of the loop device. This device is a pseudo-device which serves as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"loop"</SPAN
> through which each call to a the file system
  has to pass. This way, data can be processed in order to encrypt and decrypt it. Since kernel 2.6, the
  Crypto API has been integrated into the main kernel, and setting up an encrypted file system has become much easier. No
  additional kernel patches are required. An update of some userspace utilities is necessary. Unfortunately, the
  use of Cryptoloop is not very well-documented so far. This HOWTO is an attempt to make it easy everyone
  to create an encrypted file system using the standard Cryptoloop functionality.

  Cryptoloop is based on the Crypto API in the 2.6 Linux kernel. It should not be confused with Loop-AES, which is a completely
  separate project. Cryptoloop is similar to the Crypto API that was available as a separate patch for the 2.4 kernel series. The
  new version is not compatible with the older one.
