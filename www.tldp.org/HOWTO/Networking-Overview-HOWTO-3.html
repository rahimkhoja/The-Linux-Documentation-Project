<P>Linux supports many different networking protocols:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">TCP/IP</A>
</H2>


<P>The Internet Protocol was originally developed two decades ago for the United States Department of Defense (DoD), mainly for the purpose of interconnecting different-brand computers. The TCP/IP suite of protocols allowed, through its layered structure, to insulate applications from networking hardware.</P>
<P>Although it is based on a layered model, it is focused more on delivering interconnectivity than on rigidly adhering to functional layers. This is one of the reasons why TCP/IP has become the de facto standard internetworking protocol as opposed to OSI.</P>
<P>TCP/IP networking has been present in Linux since its beginnings. It has been implemented from scratch. It is one of the most robust, fast and reliable implementations and is one of the key factors of the success of Linux.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">TCP/IP version 6</A>
</H2>


<P>IPv6, sometimes also referred to as IPng (IP Next Generation) is an upgrade to the IPv4 protocol in order to address many issues. These issues include: shortage of available IP addresses, lack of mechanisms to handle time-sensitive traffic, lack of network layer security, etc. </P>
<P>The larger name space will be accompanied by an improved addressing scheme, which will have a great impact on routing performance.
A beta implementation exists for Linux, and a production version is expected for the 2.2.0 Linux kernel release.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.3">IPX/SPX</A>
</H2>

<P>IPX/SPX (Internet Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) is a proprietary protocol stack developed by Novell and based on the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol. IPX/SPX became prominent during the early 1980s as an integral part of Novell, Inc.'s NetWare. NetWare became the de facto standard network operating system (NOS) of first generation LANs. Novell complemented its NOS with a business-oriented application suite and client-side connection utilities.</P>
<P>Linux has a very clean IPX/SPX implementation, allowing it to be configured as an:
<UL>
<LI> IPX router</LI>
<LI> IPX bridge</LI>
<LI> NCP client and/or NCP Server (for sharing files)</LI>
<LI> Novell Print Client, Novell Print Server</LI>
</UL>

And to:
<UL>
<LI> Enable PPP/IPX, allowing a Linux box to act as a PPP server/client </LI>
<LI> Perform IPX tunnelling through IP, allowing the connection of two IPX networks through an IP only link</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Additionally, 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com">Caldera</A> offers commercial support for Novell NetWare under Linux. Caldera provides a fully featured Novell NetWare client built on technology licensed from Novell Corporation. The client provides full client access to Novell 3.x and 4.x fileservers and includes features such as NetWare Directory Service (NDS) and RSA encryption.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.4">AppleTalk Protocol Suite</A>
</H2>

<P>Appletalk is the name of Apple's internetworking stack. It allows a peer-to-peer network model which provides basic functionality such as file and printer sharing. Each machine can simultaneously act as a client and a server, and the software and hardware necessary are included with every Apple computer.</P>
<P>Linux provides full Appletalk networking. Netatalk is a kernel-level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. It includes support for routing AppleTalk, serving Unix and AFS filesystems over AFP (AppleShare), serving Unix printers and accessing AppleTalk printers over PAP.</P>
<P>See section 5.1 for more information.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.5">WAN Networking: X.25, Frame-relay, etc...</A>
</H2>

<P>Several third parties provide T-1, T-3, X.25 and Frame Relay products for Linux. Generally special hardware is required for these types of connections. Vendors that provide the hardware also provide the drivers with protocol support.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.6">ISDN</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux kernel has built-in ISDN capabilies. Isdn4linux controls ISDN PC cards and can emulate a modem with the Hayes command set ("AT" commands). The possibilities range from simply using a terminal program to connections via HDLC (using included devices) to full connection to the Internet with PPP to audio applications.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.7">PPP, SLIP, PLIP</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux kernel has built-in support for PPP (Point-to-Point-Protocol), SLIP (Serial Line IP) and PLIP (Parallel Line IP). PPP is the most popular way individual users access their ISPs (Internet Service Providers). PLIP allows the cheap connection of two machines. It uses a parallel port and a special cable, achieving speeds of 10kBps to 20kBps. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8</A> <A HREF="Networking-Overview-HOWTO.html#toc3.8">Amateur Radio</A>
</H2>

<P>The Linux kernel has built-in support for amateur radio protocols.</P>
<P>Especially interesting is the AX.25 support. The AX.25 protocol offers both connected and connectionless modes of operation, and is used either by itself for point-point links, or to carry other protocols such as TCP/IP and NetRom.</P>
<P>It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to make it more useful in the amateur radio environment.
