><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib</TT

CLASS="FILENAME"
>fastboot</TT

    This is a complicated solution, but I guess it should work on most sites. The IP address can alternatively be obtained with the output of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifconfig</B
> and the hostname can be obtained from the output of the host command, but this is not portable, because these outputs differ from system to system depending on the distribution you are using, and the locales settings.</P
><P
>Then, the hostname should be set with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hostname $HOSTNAME</B

><P
>In the <TT
