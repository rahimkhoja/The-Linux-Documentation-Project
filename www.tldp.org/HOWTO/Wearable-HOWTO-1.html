<P>I am not a guru in wearable computing, simply after some years
using HP95LX and HP200LX palmtop computers more like  wearables than like a PDA ( thanks to DOS
5, the HP200LX even allowed me to do a semester CS project using turbo pascal
while commuting in  
the subway ),  and living with a palm IIIx and a laptop running Linux,
to me the next step is having a wearable running Linux, thus I have
spent more than a year reading various informations on wearable and
taking a little part in the wear-hard mailing list. As more an more
people will be interested in the wearable concept I have decided to 
start this HOWTO in order to help them ( At the time of this writing
I am building my own 
wearable using my laptop ( Toshiba 430CDT ) with a twiddler keyboard, emacspeak, 
and camcorders batteries. )
<P>Some people may, at least, be surprised to find the &quot;In the army now&quot;
section so I would like to explain my position: I am trying to write this
HOWTO both as a journalist and a scientist would do: this implies as a 
journalist to
look for information from every source available, and as a scientist
to be neutral: and as the US Army is willing to purchase more than
30.000 units one can hardly overlook this user group.
This document is  intended to be the
starting point of a long term work. If you have any information ( that
can be checked ) that you think is of interest, do not hesitate
contact me.
