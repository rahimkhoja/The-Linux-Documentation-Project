<H2><A NAME="installing"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Installing Your Shiny New BIND</A></H2>

<P>I should mention that if you have an existing installation of BIND, such as from
an RPM, you should probably remove it before installing the new one.  On Red Hat
systems, this probably means removing the packages <CODE>bind</CODE> and
<CODE>bind-utils</CODE>, and possibly <CODE>bind-devel</CODE> and <CODE>caching-nameserver</CODE>,
if you have them.
<P>You may want to save a copy of the init script (e.g.,
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/named</CODE>), if any, before doing so; it'll be useful later
on.
<P>If you are upgrading from an older version of BIND, such as BIND 8, you will
want to read the migration documentation in the file <CODE>doc/misc/migration</CODE>
in the BIND source package.  I don't deal with any migration issues in this
document; I simply assume that you are replacing an existing, working
installation of BIND 9.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Installing the Binaries</A>
</H2>

<P>This is the easy part :-).  Just run <CODE>make install</CODE> and let it take care of
it for you.  Really, that's it!
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Setting up the Init Script</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have an existing init script from your distribution, it would probably
be best simply to modify it to run the new binary, with the appropriate
switches.  The switches are... <I>(drumroll please...)</I>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>-u named</CODE>, which tells BIND to run as the user <CODE>named</CODE>, rather
than <CODE>root</CODE>.</LI>
<LI><CODE>-t /chroot/named</CODE>, which tells BIND to chroot itself to the jail
that we've set up.</LI>
<LI><CODE>-c /etc/named.conf</CODE>, which tells BIND where to find its
configuration file within the jail.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following is the init script I use with my Red Hat 6.0 system.  As you can
see, it is almost exactly the same as the way it shipped from Red Hat.  I
haven't tried the <CODE>rndc</CODE> commands yet, but I can't see any reason why
they shouldn't work.

<P>As with syslogd, as of Red Hat 7.2 this process is now even easier.  There is
a file called <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/named</CODE> in which extra parameters for syslogd
can be defined.  The default <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/named</CODE> on Red Hat 7.2,
however, will check for the existance of <CODE>/etc/named.conf</CODE> before
starting.  You will need to correct this path.
<P>On Caldera OpenLinux systems, you simply need to modify the variables defined
at the top, and it will apparently take care of the rest for you:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
NAME=named
DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/$NAME
OPTIONS="-t /chroot/named -u named -c /etc/named.conf"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And for FreeBSD 4.3, you can edit the <CODE>rc.conf</CODE> file and put in the
following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
named_enable="YES"
named_program="chroot/named/bin/named"
named_flags="-u named -t /chroot/named -c /etc/namedb/named.conf"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Configuration Changes</A>
</H2>

<P>You will also have to add or change a few options in your <CODE>named.conf</CODE> to
keep the various directories straight.  In particular, you should add (or
change, if you already have them) the following directives in the <CODE>options</CODE>
section:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
directory "/etc/namedb";
pid-file "/var/run/named.pid";
statistics-file "/var/run/named.stats";
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Since this file is being read by the <CODE>named</CODE> daemon, all the paths are of
course relative to the chroot jail.  As of this writing, BIND 9 does not support
many of the statistics and dump files that previous versions did.  Presumably
later versions will; if you are running such a version, you may have to add
additional entries to cause BIND to write them to the <CODE>/var/run</CODE> directory
as well.
