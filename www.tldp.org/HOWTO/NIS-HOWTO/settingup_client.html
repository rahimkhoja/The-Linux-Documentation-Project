>7.1. The ypbind daemon



&#13;</H2
><P
>After you have succesfully compiled the software you are now ready
to install it. A suitable place for the ypbind daemon is the directory
/usr/sbin. Some people may tell you that you don't need
ypbind on a system with NYS. This is wrong. ypwhich and ypcat need it
always.</P
><P
>You must do this as root of course. The other binaries (ypwhich,
ypcat, yppasswd, yppoll, ypmatch) should go in a directory accessible
by all users, normally /usr/bin.</P
><P
>Newer ypbind versions have a configuration file called /etc/yp.conf. You can
hardcode a NIS server there - for more info see the manual page for ypbind(8).
You also need this file for NYS.
An example:

><P
>If the system can resolve the hostnames without NIS, you may use
the name, otherwise you have to use the IP address. ypbind 3.3 has a bug
and will only use the last entry (ypserver 10.3.1.1 in the example). All
other entries are ignored. ypbind-mt handle this correct and uses
that one, which answerd at first.</P

startup files. To test ypbind do the following:</P

>7.6. Shadow Passwords with NIS&#13;</H2
><P
>Shadow passwords over NIS are always a bad idea. You loose the security,
which shadow gives you, and it is supported by only some few Linux C
Libraries. A good way to avoid shadow passwords over NIS is,
to put only the local system users in /etc/shadow. Remove the NIS user
entries from the shadow database, and put the password back in passwd.
So you can use shadow for the root login, and normal passwd for NIS
user. This has the advantage that it will work with every NIS client.</P
