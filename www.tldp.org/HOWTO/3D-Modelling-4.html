<P>Instead of a frequently asked questions section, here is information
about some of the (almost embarassing) problems faced.

</H2>

<P>The most frustrating problem, initially, was trying to figure out why
everything was black -- and then how to actually light objects up.  In
these "virtual worlds" where you are modelling objects, the worlds
are created from scratch.  There is <EM>no light</EM> in the world until
you actually put a light source in it!  The light sources then shine
a given direction, illuminating things in their path (according to
the surface properties of the objects).  Make certain that your light
source is:

<OL>
<LI>pointing (rotated and translated) in the correct direction;</LI>
<LI>intense enough to actually cast discernable lighting.</LI>

</H2>

<P>The most basic thing a person would want to do with modelling/rendering
packages is position a sphere on a surface, give it some lighting, and
see the result.  A decent tutorial should describe that first.
<P>That said, <EM>The Mops</EM> has a wonderful
