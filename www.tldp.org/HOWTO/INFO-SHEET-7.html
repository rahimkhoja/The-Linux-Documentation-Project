<P> Although Linux is supplied with the complete source code,
it is copyrighted software, not public domain.  However, it is
available for free under the GNU General Public License, sometimes
referred to as the ``copyleft''.  See the GPL for more
information.  The programs that run under Linux each have their
own copyright, although many of them use the GPL as well.  X
uses the MIT X copyright, and some utilities are under the BSD
copyright.  In any case, all of the software on the FTP site is
freely distributable (or else it shouldn't be there).
