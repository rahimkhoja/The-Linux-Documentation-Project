>Drivers for SCSI devices consist of a driver for the
        SCSI host adapter (e.g. an Adaptec 1542), and a driver for the
        type of SCSI device you use, e.g. a hard disk, a CD-ROM or a
        tape-drive. All of these can be loaded as modules. However,
        when you want to access e.g. the CD-ROM drive that is
        connected to the Adaptec card, the kernel and kerneld only
        knows that it needs to load the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sr_mod</TT
>
        module in order to support SCSI CD-ROM's; it does not know
        what SCSI controller the CD-ROM is connected to, and hence
        does not know what module to load to support the SCSI
        controller. </P
><P
>To resolve this, you can add an entry for the SCSI
        driver module to your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/conf.modules</TT
>
        that tells kerneld which of the many possible SCSI controller
        modules it should load: </P

><P
>This works if you have only one SCSI controller. If you
        have more than one, things become a little more
        difficult.</P
><P
>In general, you cannot have kerneld load a driver for a
        SCSI host adapter, if a driver for another host adapter is
        already installed. You must either build both drivers into
        your kernel (not as modules), or load the modules

>st.o</TT
>.  My machine at home is set up
            almost exactly like the setup above, and it works fine for
            all my secondary scsi devices, including tape, cd-rom, and
            generic scsi devices.  The drawback is that
            <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>depmod -a</B
> can't autodetect these
            dependencies, so the user needs to add them by hand, and
            not run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>depmod -a</B

            it is set up, kerneld will autoload the
            <TT

            fine.</P

>You should be aware, that this technique only works if

>Sometimes, just loading the module is not enough to get
        things working.  For instance, if you have your sound card
        compiled as a module, it is often convenient to set a certain
        volume level. Only problem is, the setting vanishes the next
        time the module is loaded. Here is a neat trick from Ben

>An earlier version of this mini-HOWTO mentioned a
          pre-remove option, that might be used to run a command just
          before kerneld removed a module. However, this has never
          worked and its use is therefore discouraged - most likely,
          this option will disappear in a future kerneld release.  The
          whole issue of module settings is undergoing some change at
          the moment, and may look different on your system by the
          time you read this. </P
