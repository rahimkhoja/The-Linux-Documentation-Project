NAME="INTRODUCTION"
>What is kerneld?</A
></H1
><P
>The kerneld feature was introduced during the 1.3
      development kernels by Bjorn Ekwall. It allows kernel modules
      such as device drivers, network drivers and filesystems to be
      loaded automatically when they are needed, rather than having to
      do it manually with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
> or
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
>. </P
><P
>And for the more amusing aspects, although these are not
      (yet ?) integrated with the standard kernel: </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>It can be setup to run a user-program instead
        of the default screen blanker, thus letting you use any
        program as a screen-saver. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Similar to the screen-blanker support, you can
        also change the standard console beep into something
        completely different. </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>kerneld consists of two components: </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Support in the Linux kernel for sending
        requests to a daemon requesting a module for a certain
        task. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A user-space daemon that can figure out what
         modules must be loaded to fulfill the request from the
         kernel. </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Both components must be working for the kerneld support to
       function; it is not enough that only one or the other has been
       setup. </P

NAME="WHY"
>Why do I want to use it ?</A
></H2
><P
>There are some good reasons for using kerneld. The ones I
      will mention are mine, others have other reasons. </P
><P

><UL
><LI
><P
>If you have to build kernels for several
        systems that only differ slightly - different kind of network
        card, for instance - then you can build a single kernel and
        some modules, instead of having to build individual kernels
        for each system. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Modules are easier for developers to test.
        You don't need to reboot the system to load and unload the
        driver; this applies to all modules, not just kerneld-loaded
        ones. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It cuts down on the kernel memory usage
        leaving more memory available for applications. Memory used by
        the kernel is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>never</I
> swapped out, so if
        you have 100Kb worth of unused drivers compiled into your
        kernel, they are simply wasting RAM. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Some of the things I use, the ftape
        floppy-tape driver, for instance, or iBCS, are only available
        as modules, but I don't want to bother with loading and
        unloading them whenever I need them. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>People making Linux distributions don't have
        to build 284 different boot images: Each user loads the
        drivers he needs for just his hardware.  Most modern Linux
        distributions will detect your hardware and will only load
        those modules actually required.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Of course, there are also reasons why you may not want to
       use it. If you prefer to have just one kernel image file with
       all of your drivers built in, you are reading the wrong
       document.</P

>The support in the Linux kernel was introduced with Linux
      1.3.57. If you have an earlier kernel version, you will need to
      upgrade if you want the kerneld support. The current Linux
      kernel sources can be found at most Linux FTP archive sites
      including:</P
