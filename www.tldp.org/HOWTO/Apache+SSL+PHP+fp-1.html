<P>Before you start reading:
I am not a native speaker, so there are probably spelling/grammatical errors
in this document. Feel encouraged to inform me of mistakes.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Description of the components</A>
</H2>

<P>The webserver you hopefully will get after having read this howto is composed
of several parts, the original apache sources with some (well, many) patches 
and some external executables. I recommend using the software versions I 
tried, they will probably compile without greater problems and result in a 
fairly stable daemon. If you are courageous, you can try to compile all the 
latest-stuff-with-tons-of-new-features, but  don't blame me if something 
fails ;-). However, you may report other working configurations to be included
in future versions of this document. All of the steps were tested on a 
linux 2.0.35 box, so the howto is somewhat linux-specific, but you should be 
able to use it for other unixes as well.
<P>You do not necesserily have to compile in all components. I tried to structure
this howto so that you can skip the parts you are not interested in.
<P>The document is neither a user manual to Apache, SSL, PHP/FI nor frontpage.
Its prime intention is to save webservice providers some headaches when 
installing their server and to do my little contribution to the linux
community.
<P><B>PHP</B> is a scripting language that supports dynamic HTML pages. It is a
bit like Apache's SSI, but by far more complex and has database modules for
many popular dbs. The GD libraries are needed by PHP.
<P><B>SSL</B> is an implementation of Netscape's Secure Socket Layer that allow
secure connections over insecure networks, e.g. to transmit credit card
numbers to web based forms.
<P><B>frontpage</B> is a wysiwyg web authoring tool that makes use of some
server-specific extensions called webbots. Some people think frontpage is
cool because you can create feedback forms and discussion webs without
having to know a bit about html or cgi. It even protects the designer
from uploading his/her site via ftp by using a builtin publisher. If you wish 
to support frontpage but do not like to setup a windows server, the apache 
server extensions are your choice.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Working configurations</A>
</H2>

<P>Though this document has been downloaded some 100 times since I published
it, I received only little feedback. In particular, noone told me of other 
working combinations. Combinations that work for me are:
<UL>
<LI>Linux 2.0.31, Apache 1.2.4, PHP 2.0.0, SSL 0.8.0, fp 98 3.0.3 (*)</LI>
<LI>Linux 2.0.33, Apache 1.2.5, PHP 2.0.1, SSL 0.8.0, fp 98 3.0.3 (*)</LI>
<LI>Linux 2.0.35, Apache 1.2.6, PHP 3, SSL 0.8.0, fp 98 3.0.4</LI>
</UL>

(*) version 3.0.3 is
