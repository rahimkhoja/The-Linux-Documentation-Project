<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc13.1">Intro to Set-Up</A>
</H2>

<P> Configuring (Set-Up) involves both storing a configuration in the
non-volatile memory of the terminal, and putting commands in start-up
files (on your hard disk) that will run each time the computer is
powered on (or possibly only when the run-level changes).  This
section gives an overview of configuring and covers the configuring of
the essential communication options for both the terminal and the
computer.  The next two major sections cover in detail the
configuration of the terminal (see 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-14.html#term_conf_details">Terminal Set-Up</A> and the computer (see 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#comp_conf_details">Computer Set-Up (Configure) Details</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="term_conf_ov"></A> <A NAME="ss13.2">13.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc13.2">Terminal Set-Up (Configure) Overview </A>
</H2>

<P> When a terminal is installed it's necessary to configure the
physical terminal by saving (in its non-volatile memory which is not
lost when the terminal is powered off) the characteristics it will
have when it is powered on.  You might be lucky and have a terminal
that has already been set-up correctly for your installation so that
little or no terminal configuration is required.</P>
<P>There are two basic ways of configuring a terminal.  One is to sit at
the terminal and go thru a series of set-up menus.  Another is to send
escape sequences to it from the host computer.  Before you can send
anything to the terminal (such as the above escape sequences), its
<A HREF="#commun_config">Communication Interface</A> options such
as the baud rate must be set up to match those of the computer.  This
can only be done by sitting at the terminal since the communications
must be set up right before the computer and the terminal can "talk"
to each other.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-14.html#term_conf_details">Terminal Set-Up</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc13.3">Computer Set-Up (Configure) Overview</A>
</H2>

<P> Besides possibly sending escape sequences from the computer to
configure the terminal, there is the configuring of the computer
itself to handle the terminal.  If you're lucky, all you need to do is
to put a "getty" command in the /etc/inittab file so that a "login:"
prompt will be sent to the terminal when the computer starts up.  See
the section 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#getty_">Getty (used in /etc/inittab)</A> for
details.</P>
<P>The computer communicates with the terminal using the serial device
driver software (part of the kernel).  The serial device driver has a
default configuration and is also partly (sometimes fully) configured
by the getty program before running "login" at each terminal.
However, additional configuration is sometimes needed using programs
named "stty" and "setserial".  These programs (if needed) must be run
each time the computer starts up since this configuration is lost each
time the computer powers down.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#comp_conf_details">Computer Set-Up (Configure) Details</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.4">13.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc13.4">Many Options</A>
</H2>

<P> There are a great many configuration options for you to choose
from.  The communication options must be set right or the terminal
will not work at all.  Other options may be set wrong, but will cause no
problem since the features they set may not be used.  For example, if
you don't have a printer connected to the terminal it makes no
difference how the printer configuration parameters are set inside the
terminal.  This last statement is not 100% correct.  Suppose that you
have no printer but the computer (by mistake) sends the terminal a
command to redirect all characters (data) from the computer to the
printer only.  Then nothing will display on the screen and your
terminal will be dead.  Some terminals have a configuration option to
inform the terminal that no printer is attached.  In this case the
terminal will ignore any command to redirect output to the "printer"
and the above problem will never happen.  However, this doesn't help
much since there are many other erroneous commands that can be sent to
your terminal that will really foul things up.  This is likely to
happen if you send the terminal a binary file by accident.</P>
<P>In some cases a wrong setting will not cause any problem until you
happen to run a rare application program that expects the terminal to
be set a certain way.  Other options govern only the appearance of the
display and the terminal will work fine if they are set wrong but may
not be as pleasant to look at.</P>
<P>Some options concern only the terminal and do not need to be set at
the computer.  For example: Do you want black letters on a light
background?  This is easier on the eyes than a black background.
Should a key repeat when held down?  Should the screen wrap when a
line runs off the right end of the screen?  Should keys click?</P>

<H2><A NAME="commun_config"></A> <A NAME="ss13.5">13.5</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc13.5">Communication Interface Options </A>
</H2>

<P> Some of these communication settings (options) are for both the
terminal and the computer and they must be set exactly the same for
both: speed, parity, bits/character, and flow control.  Other
communication options are only set at the terminal (and only a couple
of these are essential to establish communications).  Still others
such as the address and interrupt (IRQ) of the physical port ttyS2 are
set only at the computer using the "setserial" command.  Until all of
the above essential options are compatibly set up there can be no
satisfactory serial communication (and likely no communication at all)
between the terminal and the computer.  For the terminal, one must set
these options manually by menus at each terminal (or by using some sort
of special cartridge at each terminal).  The host computer is
configured by running commands each time the computer is powered up
(or when people log in).  Sometimes the getty program (found in the
/etc/inittab file) which starts the login process will take care of
this for the computer.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#getty_">Getty (used in /etc/inittab)</A></P>

<A HREF="#parity_">Parity</A></LI>

</P>
<P>If the  
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#getty_">Getty (used in /etc/inittab)</A> program
can't set up the computer side the way you want, then you may need to
use one (or both) of the 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-15.html#stty_setserial">Stty &amp; Setserial</A> commands.</P>

<H3><A NAME="speed"></A> Speed </H3>

<P> These must be set the same on both the terminal and the computer.
The speed is the bits/sec (bps or baud rate).  Use the highest speed
that works without errors.  Enabling flow control may make higher
speeds possible.  There may be two speeds to set at the terminal:
Transmit and Receive, sometimes abbreviated T and R.  Usually they are
both set the same since stty in Linux doesn't seem to have the option
yet of setting them differently.  (There is an option to do this with
the "stty" command but it seems to actually set them both the same.)
Common speeds are 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, ...
The slower speeds (like 600) are for printers and hard-copy terminals.</P>

<H3><A NAME="parity_"></A> Parity &amp; should you use it ? </H3>

<P> For a definition see 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-23.html#parity_def">Parity Explained</A>.
Parity-disabled is often the default.  To enable parity, you must both
enable it and then select either even or odd parity.  It probably
makes no difference if it's odd or even.  For terminals there are
sometimes settings for both transmit and receive parity.  You should
set both of these the same since stty at the computer doesn't permit
setting them differently.  The PC serial port usually can't support
different parities either.  Some terminal are unable to set receive
parity and will simply always ignore received parity bits.  On some
older terminals if you use 8-data-bits per byte then parity will not
work since there is no room in the hardware for the extra parity bit.</P>
<P>Should you use parity  at all?  Parity, while not really necessary, is
nice to have.  If you don't have parity, then you may get an incorrect
letter here and there and wind up trying to correct spelling errors
that don't really exist.  However parity comes at a cost.  First, it's
more complicated to set up since the default is usually no parity.
Secondly, parity will slow down the speed with which bytes travel over
the serial cable since there will be one more bit per byte.  This may
or may not slow down the effective speed.</P>
<P>For example, a hard-copy terminal is usually limited by the mechanics
of the printing process.  Increasing the bytes/sec when the computer
(its UART chip) is transmitting only results in more flow-control
"halt" signals to allow the mechanical printing to catch up.  Due to
more flow-control waits the effective speed is no better without
parity than with it.  The situation is similar for some terminals:
After you implement parity there may be fewer flow-control waits per
unit time resulting in more bits/sec (average).  However, due to the
added parity bits the bytes/sec (average) stays the same.</P>
<P>One option is to install terminals with no parity.  Then if parity
errors are noticed, it can be implemented later.  To spot possible
errors with no parity, look for any spelling errors you don't think
you made.  If you spot such an error, refresh the screen (retransmit
from the computer).  If the error goes away, then it's likely a parity
error.  If too many such errors happen (such as more than one every
few hundred screens) then corrective action is needed such as:  Enable
parity and/or reduce speed, and/or use a shorter/better cable.
Enabling parity will not reduce the number of errors but it will tell
you when an error has happened.</P>
<P>Just the opposite policy is to initially enable parity.  Then if no
parity errors (error symbols on the CRT) are ever seen (over a
reasonable period of time, say a month or two) it may be safely
disabled.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch_size"></A> Bits/Character </H3>

<P> This is the character size (the number of data bits per character
excluding any parity bit).  To use international character sets you
need 8 bits.  But it's not of much use unless your terminal has the
fonts for them.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-9.html#char_sets">Character-Sets</A> If you
are only going to use ASCII characters, then select 7-bits since it's
faster to transmit 7 bits than 8.  Some very old terminals only
support 7-bit characters.</P>


<H3>Which Flow Control (Handshaking) ?</H3>

<P> The choice is between "hardware" (for example  dtr/cts)
or "software" (Xon/Xoff) flow control.  While hardware flow control
may be faster (if the one or two extra wires for it are available in
the cable and if the terminal supports it) in most cases Xon/Xoff
should work OK.  Some people report that they solved disturbing
problems (see below) by converting to hardware flow control but
software flow control has worked fine at other installations (and for
me personally).</P>
<P>If you use software (Xon/Xoff) flow control and have users who don't
know about it, then they may accidentally send an Xoff to the host and
lock up their terminal.  While it's locked, they may type frantically
in a vain attempt to unlock it.  Then when Xon is finally sent to
restore communication, all that was typed in haste gets executed,
perhaps with unexpected results.  They can't do this with hardware
flow control.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-11.html#flow_control">Flow Control</A> for an
explanation of flow control.</P>

<H3><A NAME="port_select"></A> Port select </H3>

<P> Since most terminals have two or more connectors on the back, it
is usually possible to assign one of these connecters to connect to
the host computer and assign another connector to be the printer port.
The connector may have a name next to it (inspect it) and this name
(such as Aux, Serial 2, or Modem) may be assigned to either be the
main host connection or the printer connection (or the like).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.6">13.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc13.6">Quick Attempt</A>
</H2>

<P> While all the above may seem overly complex, to get a terminal
working is often fairly simple.  The 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-4.html#quick_install">Quick Install</A> section describes a simple way to try to do
this.  But if that doesn't work or if you want to make the display
look better and perform better, more reading will be needed.</P>
