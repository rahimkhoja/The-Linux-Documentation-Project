       maildir2smtp - blast a maildir across SMTP

       maildir2smtp is designed to pass messages along a SLIP  or
       PPP  link.  To set this up on the disconnected end, create
       a new maildir in alias:

          # maildirmake ~alias/pppdir
          # chown -R alias ~alias/pppdir

       Put

          :alias-ppp

       into control/virtualdomains and

          ./pppdir/

       into ~alias/.qmail-ppp-default.  Don't  forget  the  extra
       slash in pppdir/.  Then, in the PPP startup script, do

          maildir2smtp ~alias/pppdir alias-ppp- $IP `hostname`

       replacing  $IP with the remote IP address.

<LI>Maildir2smtp requires the dotted IP address of your mail server. If you do not have this then ping YourMail.host.country which will return the IP.

<LI>This command can be included in your login script to flush all queued mail after logging in to your ISP.
