<P>
<P>This is the Linux Advocacy mini-HOWTO and is intended to provide guidelines
and ideas to assist with <EM>your</EM> Linux advocacy efforts.
<P>This mini-HOWTO was inspired by Jon ``maddog'' Hall when he responded to a
request for feedback on guidelines for advocating Linux during
<A HREF="http://www.netday.org">NetDay</A> activities.  He responded positively to the
guidelines and observed that they were the basis of a list of ``canons
of conduct'' that would benefit the Linux community.

<P>If you need to know more about the

<A HREF="mailto:linux-howto@sunsite.unc.edu">&lt;linux-howto@sunsite.unc.edu&gt;</A>.
Tim Bynum will post this document to several national and international
newsgroups on a monthly basis.
<P>A personal note: Due to various circumstances, I have not been able
to dedicate as much time to maintaining this mini-HOWTO and interacting
with the Linux community as I would have desired.  I apologize for this
and if you have attempted to contact me and I was slow in responding,
please forgive me being so inconsiderate.  While I still have many other
commitments, I am anticipating that they will start requiring less time
to meet and allow me to catch up on other parts of my life.
I appreciate your patience and would like to extend a special thanks
to all who have taken the time to suggest additions and corrections.
