<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc5.1">Intro to Why Use a Terminal </A>
</H2>

<P>Many of these arguments apply also to GUI "thin-client" type of
terminal.  The case for such terminals is frequently being made today
and promoters are devising new slogans and names in an attempt to
market the modern terminal concept under another name.  For example "Cloud Computing".  </P>
<P>PC's are so powerful today that just one PC can often support
several persons using it at once, especially if they are doing
low-load tasks such as text editing, data entry, etc.  One way to do
this is to connect a number of terminals to a single PC (or other host
computer) by modems or direct cable connection.  To do this, it's
usually best to have a multi-user operating system such as Linux so
that each user at a terminal can use the computer independently.  This
has been called "time sharing" but it's not good terminology today
since "distributed" computing over a network is also a type of time
sharing.  It might be better described as "centralized" computing.
But the central computer may be connected to the rest of the world via
a network so that terminal users may send email, browse the Internet,
etc.  So it's not exactly "centralized" either.</P>
<P>Prior to about 2000, terminals were seldom used with PC's because the
popular operating systems used for them (Windows, DOS, and Mac) were
not multiuser until 1998 (available for MS Windows NT) and previously
could not support terminals very well.  Now that Linux, a multiuser
operating system, is freely available for PC's, the use of terminals
with PC's becomes more feasible.  While text terminals are not smart
enough to support the type of graphical user interface (GUI) that most
computer users today expect, thin client type terminals are.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc5.2">Lower Hardware Costs ? </A>
</H2>

<P> When Computers (including PCs) were quite expensive, lower
hardware costs was a significant advantage of using terminals.  Today
with cheap PCs, the cost savings is problematical.  I wrote the next
three paragraphs years ago when PCs were more expensive.  They are still
valid today but of less significance:</P>
<P>If several people use the same computer as the same time, there is a
reduction in the amount of hardware needed for the same level of
service.  One type of savings is due to code sharing.  The application
files on hard disks are shared as well as shared libraries in memory
(even when people are running different programs provided they use
some of the same functions in their code).  Another type of savings is
due to reduction of peak load.  The hardware of a single PC may be
idle most of the time as people slowly type in information, think,
talk, or are away from their desks.  Having several people on the same
computer at once makes good use of much of this idle time which would
otherwise be wasted.</P>
<P>These savings are substantial.  One may roughly estimate (using
statistical theory) that for 9 persons (8 terminals &amp; 1 console) the
shared PC only needs only about 3 times as much capacity (in memory,
disk storage, CPU power, etc.) as a single PC in order to provide the
same level of service per person.  Thus the computational hardware for
such a shared system should only cost about 1/3 as much per user.
However, the cost of the display hardware (CRT's, keyboards, video
electronics, etc.) is about the same for both cases.  The terminals
have the added cost of requiring additional physical cable connectors
(such as serial ports) at the host computer.</P>
<P>For a fair comparison with PC's, the terminals should have the same
capabilities as the PC monitors.  Unfortunately, color graphic
terminals for Linux (X Window) with high speed communication cost
about as much as a PC so in this case there not much (if any) savings
in hardware costs.  But for text terminals there will be some savings,
especially if the terminals are obtained used at low cost.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc5.3">Control of Software </A>
</H2>

<P> For centralized computing, software (and the updates to software)
only need be installed and configured on one host computer instead of
several.  The person in charge of this computer may control and
configure the software which is installed on it.  This is advantageous
if the person controlling the host computer does an excellent job and
knows about the needs and preferences of the other users.  Users can
be restricted in playing games or surfing the Internet, etc.
Whether or not centralized control is desirable depends on the
situation.  It's in a sense depriving users of their "right" to
controls what they do with their computer including things that would
improve their efficiency at work and/or entertain them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc5.4">Hardware Upgrades </A>
</H2>

<P> With terminals, the computer hardware
upgrades take place on only one computer instead of many.  This saves
installation labor effort.  While the cost of the hardware for the
host computer upgrade will be more than that for a single PC (since
the host needs more computing power than a PC), the cost will be
significantly less than upgrading the hardware of a number of PC's
being used instead of terminals.</P>

</H2>

<P> 
<UL>
<LI> The elimination of noise from fans and disk drives (unless
you're using a PC to emulate a terminal).</LI>
<LI> The users of the terminals can share data and files and send
e-mail to each other.  But they could also do this if the used PC on a
local network or via email over the internet.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc5.6">Major Disadvantages of Text Terminals </A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>  For the case of text terminals there is no high-speed graphic
display (or high resolution graphics) although they can often use
graphic character sets to draw boxes, etc.  This lack limits the
software that may be used on it.</LI>
<LI> A detailed display of progress will sometimes greatly increase
the time taken to do the job. For example, when copying a large
number of files and displaying the name of each, the terminal may
only be able to display the full path names of say 30 files per
second so only 30 files per second will be copied.  But the computer
hardware is capable of copying at a rate many times higher.  This
can often be fixed by using options of application programs for a
minimal display of progress.  See 
<A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO-17.html#slow_scroll">Problem with Slow Scrolling</A></LI>
<LI>Most new computers don't have serial ports anymore, making it
difficult to use them to emulate text terminals that connect over a
serial line.  One could perhaps connect by dialup using an analog
modem, but with high speed cable or DSL modems, the analog modem is
becoming obsolete.</LI>

</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> If the host computer goes down, then no one can use the
terminals either (unless there is a "standby" host computer to connect
to).</LI>
<LI>As compared to a laptop, it's not portable.  That is, you can't
easily take it around with you, unless you have some way of connecting
to your host computer where ever you go.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8</A> <A HREF="Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html#toc5.8">Are Text Terminals Obsolete ? </A>
</H2>

<P> Text terminals are technologically obsolete because for a slightly
higher cost of hardware, one can build a smarter terminal (with the
same quality of display).  This wasn't always the case since around
1980 memory cost thousands of dollars per megabyte.  Today with low
costs for memory and processors, one could turn a text terminal into a
GUI graphic terminal for only about a 10% or 20% increase in hardware
cost.</P>
<P>Since a PC can emulate a terminal, almost everyone using computers had
a terminal emulator available until PCs started removing the serial
port from new models during the 2000-2010 decade.  You might think
that now text terminals would be more in demand since emulating a
directly connected terminal is only feasible with newer PC's (with no
serial ports)  only if one purchases such ports.  But if one wants to
connect text terminals (including  emulated ones) to a PC via the
serial port they will be out of luck if the Linux PC doesn't have a
serial port.  Thus the disappearing serial port tends to make the text
terminal even more obsolete.</P>
<P>The reasons that text terminals are (or were) not fully obsolete are: 
<UL>
<LI> The resolution of characters on the screen was better on
monochrome terminals than for cheaper PC monitors in text mode.
But for high resolution monitors the character resolution is fine.</LI>
<LI> Some people don't need full screen graphics.</LI>
<LI> Since running a text-terminal (in contrast to a GUI-graphics
terminal) doesn't consume much of a modern PC's resources, a large
number of terminals may be efficiently run from one PC.</LI>
