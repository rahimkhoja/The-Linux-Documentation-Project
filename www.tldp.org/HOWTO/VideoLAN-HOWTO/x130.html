>1.2. What is a codec ?</H1
><P
>&#13;To fully understand the VideoLAN solution, you must
understand the difference between a <EM
>codec</EM
> and a
<EM
>container format</EM
>

</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;A <EM
>codec</EM
> is a compression
algorithm, used to reduce the size of a stream. There are audio codecs
and video codecs. MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Vorbis, DivX, ... are
codecs

</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;A <EM
>container format</EM
> contains
one or several streams already encoded by codecs. Very often, there
is an audio stream and a video one. AVI, Ogg, MOV, ASF, ... are
container formats. The streams contained can be encoded using different
codecs. In a perfect world, you could put any codec in any container
format. Unfortunately, there are some incompatibilities. You can
find a matrix of possible codecs and container formats on the <A

page</A
>


</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;To decode a stream, VLC first
<EM
>demuxes</EM
> it. This means that it reads the container
format and separates audio, video, and subtitles, if any. Then, each of
these are passed <EM
>decoders</EM
> that do the mathematical
processing to decompress the streams

.</P
><P
>&#13;There is a particular thing about MPEG:

</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;MPEG is a <EM
>codec</EM
>. There are
several versions of it, called MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, ...

</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>MPEG is also a container format, sometimes refered
to as <EM
>MPEG System</EM
>. There are several types of MPEG:
ES, PS, and TS</P
><P
>When you play an MPEG video from a DVD, for instance, the MPEG
stream is actually composed of several streams (called Elementary
Streams, ES): there is one stream for video, one for audio, another for
subtitles, and so on. These different streams are mixed together into a
single Program Stream (PS). So, the .VOB files you can find in a DVD are
actually MPEG-PS files. But this PS format is not adapted for streaming
video through a network or by satellite, for instance. So, another
format called Transport Stream (TS) was designed for streaming MPEG
videos through such channels.</P
