</H2>


<P>Hexen II is a colourful adaption of the Quake engine, and in terms of
source code and theme is much closer than Quake II to the original
game. Unfortunately, 
<A HREF="http://ravensoft.com">Raven Software</A>
released the game with many rough edges... So beautiful, yet so cruel.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://uhexen2.sourceforge.net">Hammer of Thyrion</A>
is the main Linux Hexen II port , and has had much work
done towards squishing bugs and enhancing the OpenGL graphics.
While it is not as widely distributed as Quake, the HoT demo includes some
of the game's best levels and is available from the Sourceforge 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uhexen2">project page</A>.</P>
<P>Mappers should note the

<P>Quake II is the sci-fi themed sequel to Quake.
Early Linux releases weren't very solid, especially the mouse handling, but there is now a few related projects to choose from.</P>

<DT><B>Open Source Projects</B><DD><P>
<A HREF="http://qudos.quakedev.com/linux/quake2">QuDos' Quake II</A>
is the most notable. It is based on 
<A HREF="http://www.icculus.org/quake2/">Icculus Quake II</A>,
and includes some beautiful graphical enhancements - including cell shading -
and support for FreeBSD and XMMS plugins.  Another project still in development
is 
<A HREF="http://jdolan.dyndns.org/jaydolan/home.html">Quetoo</A> which
has speed and security enhancements, but also a very stripped back interface
and a few bugs.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.yamagi.org/quake2">Yamagi Quake II</A>, also based on Icculus, is an active Q2
project focusing on single player game and cooperative game modes.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://hkitchen.net/qfusion/">Qfusion</A> appears an interesting project... that's slipped under my radar till now. An advanced multipurpose engine based on Quake II.</P>
<P>Older projects include Michael Olson's 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~olson/linux/quake2-0.12-1jag.src.rpm">source</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~olson/linux/quake2-0.12-1jag.i386.rpm">binary</A> rpms (which appear to be based on an old Icculus release) and
the 
<A HREF="http://www.quakeforge.net/files/quake2forge/quake2-0.3.tar.gz">QuakeForge Quake II</A> project with support for multiple operating
systems.  On a slightly different note - the 
<A HREF="http://www.bytonic.de/html/jake2.html">Jake2</A> project is a version
of Quake II written in Java.</P>

<DT><B>Notes</B><DD><P>A common command line option is: <BR><B> +set vid_ref glx +set gl_driver /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 </B><BR>
which tells the game to start in OpenGL mode.</P>
<P>See the

<A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/digitalpaint/">Digital Paint 2</A> is
an "original" multiplayer game based on the Quake II engine. It's colourful and
fun nature is a departure from the usual dark tone of most Quake games. Being a
totally remodeled game, it doesn't require you to have the original Quake II
;->.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc6.3">Quake III Arena </A>
</H2>


<P>Quake III was one of the first games to receive a full Linux commercial release. It's
a great game which more than survives. Mods are numerous, and of better visual
quality than Quake I or II.
For more info about installing the game, try
<A HREF="http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/q3a/INSTALL">idsoftware's Faq</A>, or

<P>The retail add-on <B>Quake III Team Arena</B> is supported and, despite getting
ordinary reviews, is a great game.  Most user mods should work with Linux. The
Linux Gamers FAQ reports:
<PRE>
    Yes, ... modifications work in Linux as long as they are compiled to the
    Quake III ... VM bytecode as advised by id software.  ...  modifications
    compiled to Windows library files will not work.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="Quake-HOWTO.html#toc6.4">Quake IV </A>
</H2>


<P>Quake IV is an epic FPS from 
<A HREF="http://ravensoft.com">Raven Software</A>.  It is based on the Doom-III engine and has high
hardware specs: A 2GHz P4 (or AMD equivalent) and 512meg ram are the official minimum
requirements.  It's a beautiful game which should really be played with the
graphical settings set to "medium" or "high". For this reason the author
recommends against using entry level cards such as the FX5200.</P>
<P>The game runs well under Linux, but still has a couple of issues:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Quake IV only runs in 32 bpp colours (X11 colour depth 24), so restart X in
this mode if you have to. Attempting to run in 16 bpp colours will give you an
error message like:

<B> Couldn't find matching GLX visual ..... Sys_Error: Unable to initialize OpenGL.</B>

Alternatively you can start a new X session with the command:
<PRE>
startx `which quake4` -- :1 -depth 24
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI> The Alsa sound libraries are used by default. To start with OSS sound , type:
<PRE>
quake4 +set s_driver oss
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI> The Quake IV  DVD Edition comes with several promotional movies.
Although the movies appear to be Windows executables, they are in fact Bink
videos, and can be viewed with the
