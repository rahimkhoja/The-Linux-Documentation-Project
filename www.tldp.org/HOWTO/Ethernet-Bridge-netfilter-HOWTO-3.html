<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Setting up the bridge</A>
</H2>

<P>We need Linux to know about the bridge. First tell it that we want one virtual 
ethernet bridge interface: (this is to be executed on host <CODE>bridge</CODE>, of course. 
See 
<A HREF="Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO-4.html#TESTING_Testing_grounds">Testing grounds</A>)
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

root@bridge:~> brctl addbr br0
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Second, we do not need the STP (Spanning Tree Protocol). I.e. we do only have 
one single router, so a loop is highly improbable. We may then deactivate this feature. 
(Results in less polluted networking environment, too):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@bridge:~> brctl stp br0 off
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

After these preparations, we now do finally some effective commands. We add our two 
(or even more) physical ethernet interfaces. That means, we attach them to the just 
born logical (virtual) bridge interface <CODE>br0</CODE>. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<DT><B>Important Note:</B><DD><P>People sent me emails that it would have helped them if I stressed more 
clearly the risk of being cut off. So listen at this point to my 
warnings:<BR>
If you read this, you are one (small) step before you _might_ cut 
yourself off your box you are going to subverse to a bridging device.<BR>
If you love living on bleeding edges, it is now the instant to prepare 
your first aid material. You will likely need it.<BR>
If you do not have physical access, nor does another person within your
range: <BR>
DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS YOUR FINGERS LEFT THE KEYBOARD IN FRONT OF YOU 
AND YOUR EYES FIXED REFLECTIVELY SOMETHING OTHER THAN YOUR CONSOLE.<BR>
You have been warned, now. No responsability is assumed for anything 
at all.</P>
</DL>

Now, our two previously physical ethernet interfaces became a logical bridge port each. 
Erm, ok, there were and will be the physical devices. They are still there, 
go have a look ;-) But now they became part of the logical bridge device and 
therefore need no IP configuration any longer. So release the IPs:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@bridge:~> ifconfig eth0 down
root@bridge:~> ifconfig eth1 down
root@bridge:~> ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up
root@bridge:~> ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0 up
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Great! We now have a box w/o any IP attached. So if you were configuring your future
fw/router via TP, go for your local console now ;-)) You have a serial console? Happy one :-)<BR>
<DL>
<DT><B>Optional:</B><DD><P>We tell Linux the new (logical) interface and associate one single IP with it:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@bridge:~> ifconfig br0 10.0.3.129 up
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</DL>

And we're done. <BR>

<P>

In case we are configuring a gateway we enable the forwarding in 
the linux kernel.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@bridge:~> echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Our box already has an IP assigned but no default route. We
solve this now:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@bridge:~> route add default gw 10.0.3.129
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Finally, we should have a working net from, to and through the gateway.</P>

</H2>

<P>Aka: We need the changes to persist reboots.<BR>
To do so, you need some sh-style script and put this in the appropriate 
system boot-up directory: <CODE>/etc/init.d/</CODE><BR>
Secondly, you create the link in your runlevel directory.
The correct directory depends on your gusto and of course on your linux 
distribution. 
Common runlevel values on workstations are <CODE>2</CODE>, <CODE>3</CODE> and <CODE>5</CODE>.
Examples are: <CODE>/etc/rc?.d/</CODE> (replace the ? with the right runlevel)<BR>
Also, you need an idea as when your network interfaces are torn up.
For now, we assume, your network interfaces are activated at system priority 
<CODE>S</CODE> so we need not to care of.
If you ever should feel the need to know exactly, look in <CODE>/etc/rcS.d/</CODE>.
We just want the bridge to be up and operable as soon as possible and so chose 
our priority to be <CODE>10</CODE>. (Make sure, no service requiring bridging devices 
is started before, read: with priority-values less than <CODE>10</CODE>)<BR>
For now, we assume, your runlevel is <CODE>5</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
root@bridge:~> mv -i bridge.sh /etc/init.d/
root@bridge:~> cd /etc/rc5.d/
root@bridge:~> ln -s ../init.d/bridge.sh S10bridge.sh
        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Virtually any distribution provides you with some runlevel-checker or 
equivalent tool that assists you in the tedious job of administering runlevel 
links. Consult your distro-documentation on this.<BR>
Hint: debian has update-rc.d, redhat and successors have chkconfig. 
Finally, SuSE evidentally has also it's own tool, too (of which I don't 
recall the name easily..).<BR>
Wondering about the contents of bridge.sh? ;-)

And, yes, make it executable..

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

After all, make sure your bridge survives unattended reboots. It's the 
same story as with backups: you should test it before you need it.</P>
