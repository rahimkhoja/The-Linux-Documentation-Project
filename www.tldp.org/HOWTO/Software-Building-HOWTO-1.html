<P>Many software packages for the various flavors of UNIX and Linux come as
compressed archives of source files.  The same package may be "built"
to run on different target machines, and this saves the author of the
software from having to produce multiple versions. A single distribution
of a software package may thus end up running, in various incarnations,
on an Intel box, a DEC Alpha, a RISC workstation, or even a mainframe.
Unfortunately, this puts the responsibility of actually "building"
and installing the software on the end user, the de facto "system
administrator", the fellow sitting at the keyboard --  you.  Take heart,
though, the process is not nearly as terrifying or mysterious as it seems,
as this guide will demonstrate.
