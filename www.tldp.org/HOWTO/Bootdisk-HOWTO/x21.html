>Graham Chapman wrote the original Bootdisk-HOWTO and supported it
      through version 3.1.  Tom Fawcett started as co-author around the time
      kernel v2 was introduced, and he is the document's current maintainer.
      Chapman has disappeared from the Linux community and his whereabouts are
      currently unknown.

            way to test out bootdisks without having to reboot your machine
            constantly.  I haven't been able to get it to work.  If anyone has
            been using this consistently with homemade bootdisks, please let
            me know.

>Figure out just how much of the init-getty-login sequence can
	    be simplified, and rip it out.  A few people have said that
	    init can be linked directly to /bin/sh; if so, and if this imposes
	    no great limitations, alter the instructions to do this.
            This would eliminate the need for getty, login, gettydefs, and
            maybe all that PAM and NSS stuff.

>Go through the 2.4 kernel source code again and write a

	    booting devices (eg flash memory) that I don't understand yet.
