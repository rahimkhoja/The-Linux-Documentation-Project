<P>The original version of this part contained a lot of unnecessary
stuff.  This is all it takes, really...

echo &quot;Starting sendmail daemon (/usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -os) [queue only mode]...&quot;

<P>The -os is not really essential, all it does is this:

<PRE>
SuperSafe [s] Be super-safe when running things, i.e.,
        always instantiate the queue file,  even  if
        you are going to attempt immediate delivery.
        Sendmail always instantiates the queue  file
        before  returning  control  the client under
        any  circumstances.   This   should   really
        always be set.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This should already be configured in the default sendmail.cf anyway.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Configuring sendmail</A>
</H2>

<P>Serious sendmail users use the m4 source for this. I recommend
this solution if you ever plan on upgrading sendmail and also
make anything but trivial changes to sendmail.cf.
<P>If you never intend to fix sendmail so envelope return headers
et al works even though you might be on dynamic dial in IP or
something, then you may not need to get the m4 source.
<P>
<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf directly, for trivial configurations</H3>

<P>This way of doing things is extremeley version dependent vs.
sendmail.cf versions. The following solution is *only* valid
for sendmail-8.8.x.

<P>
<P>The important flag above is ``e''. Don't fuss if the other flags
look different in your file. Keep your flags as-is, only add ``e''
to your flags according to the above examples, unless it's there
already. ``e'' marks the mailers as ``expensive''.
<P>
<H3>Configuring sendmail.cf using m4 source</H3>

<P>In the following I will, for simplicity, assume that the sendmail
version is 8.8.7. If you have a different version, replace 8.8.7
with that version number below! Also, the instructions will not
work for older versions of sendmail. Get the latest sendmail!
<P>
<P>Download the sendmail source.
Try ``http://WWW.Sendmail.ORG'' or possibly ``ftp.sendmail.org''.
<P>
<P>I also recommend that you obtain my patch for allowing envelope
sender reverse aliasing and other nice stuff to really make you
take control over your mail environment.
<P>Write to ``Sendmail Patch &lt;sendmail@lege.com&gt;'',
Subject: ``sendmail-8.8.7'', if 8.8.7 is your sendmail version.
<P>They are also available from ``http://www.lege.com'', as is
the sgml source of this mini-HOWTO!
<P>You don't have to get my patches in order to get ``Queue Remote
Mail + Deliver Local Mail'' to work. My patches solve other
things. But I just thought this would be a nice place to mention
them, as many Linux users will find them extremely useful.
(They will even give you properly working virtual domains, if you
like. The virtual domains don't have to be ``local''. They will
give you ``xaliases'', or in other words ``reverse aliasing''.)
<P>Unpack the sendmail source. You may get /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/.
cd /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf
<P>Now overlay my patch, if you want it, otherwise skip this step:
If you don't want to use procmail as Local Delivery Agent, save
away your /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/ostype/linux.m4 before
doing this...
Save my patch to ``/tmp/sendmail-8.8.7-cf-cpio-idcmu.gz'', then...
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf
gzip -dc &lt; /tmp/sendmail-8.8.7-cf-cpio-idcmu.gz | cpio -idcmu
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you didn't want to use procmail, write back the saved copy of
/usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/ostype/linux.m4 again.
<P>And regardless of if you applied my patch or not, you must make
sure these lines or very similar ones are added to
/usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf/cf/yourhostname.smtp.mc
(but if you applied my patch you may want to investigate filenames
containing the word ``elijah'', under /usr/src/sendmail-8.8.7/cf):
