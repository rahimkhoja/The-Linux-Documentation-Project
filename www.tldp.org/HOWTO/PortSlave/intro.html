>First, I just want to thank all the Linux programmers out there. Your
contributions have made a difference. I hope this small contribution
is useful to the Linux users out there.

>I wrote this as a beginning for using Portslave with the
Linux router project. It seems that Portslave is a widely used
program with no documentation. Since I just dove into using Portslave
I am sure this document can be improved by others over time. After
several days of fighting Portslave I figured out how incredibly easy
to use it really is.
  </P
><P
>The trouble I ran into most of the time was PAP Authentication
failure. This was really tough thing to work out (I thought). I also
had a few other errors, but if you follow this How To it should at
least get you started (or start you to the insane asylum).
