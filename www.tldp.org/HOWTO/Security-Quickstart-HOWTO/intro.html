> The above is real, live data from a one week period for my home LAN.
 Much of the above would seem to be specifically targeted at Linux systems.
 Many of the targeted <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"destination"</SPAN
> ports are used by well known
 Linux and Unix services, and all may be installed, and possibly
 even running, on your system. </P
><P
> The focus here will be on threats that are shared by all Linux users, whether
 a dual boot home user, or large commercial site. And we will take a few,
 relatively quick and easy steps that will make a typical home Desktop system
 or small office system running  Linux reasonably safe
 from the majority of outside threats. For those responsible for Linux systems
 in a larger or more complex environment, you'd be well advised to read this,
 and then follow up with additional reading suitable to your particular
 situation. Actually, this is probably good advice for everybody.&#13;</P
><P
> We will assume the reader knows little about Linux, networking, TCP/IP, 
 and the finer points of running a server Operating System like Linux. We 
 will also assume, for the sake of this document, that all local users are
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"trusted"</SPAN
> users, and won't address physical or local network
 security issues in any detail. Again, if this is not the case, further
 reading is strongly recommended.

   </P

     degrees of insecurity.

></P
><UL

><P
>    Step 1: Turn off, and perhaps uninstall, any and all unnecessary services.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Step 2: Make sure that any services that are installed are updated and
    patched to the current, safe version -- <EM
>and then stay that
    way</EM
>. Every server application has potential exploits. Some have
    just not been found yet.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Step 3: Limit connections to us from outside sources by implementing a
    firewall and/or other restrictive policies. The goal is to allow only the
    minimum traffic necessary for whatever our individual situation may be.
