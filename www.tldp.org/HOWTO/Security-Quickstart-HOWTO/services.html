><P
> In this section we will see which services are running on our freshly installed
 system, decide which we really need, and do away with the rest. If you are
 not familiar with how servers and TCP connections work, you may want to read
 the section on <A
HREF="appendix.html#SERVERSETC"
>servers and ports</A
> in the
 Appendix first. If not familiar with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>netstat</B
> utility,
 you may want to read a quick <A
HREF="appendix.html#NETSTAT"
>overview</A
> of it
 beforehand. There is also a section in the Appendix on <A
HREF="appendix.html#PORTS"
>ports</A
>, and corresponding services. You may want to 
 look that over too.</P
><P
> Our goal is to turn off as many services as possible. If we can turn them 
 all off, or at least off to outside connections, so much the better. Some
 rules of thumb we will use to guide us:</P
><P
> <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>   It is perfectly possible to have a fully functional Internet connection
   with no servers running that are accessible to outside connections. Not 
   only possible, but desirable in many cases. The principle here is that 
   you will never be successfully broken into via a port that is not opened 
   because no server is listening on it. No server == no port open == not
   vulnerable. At least to outside connections.
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   If you don't recognize a particular service, chances are good you don't 
   really need it. We will assume that and so we'll turn it off. This may 
   sound dangerous, but is a good rule of thumb to go by. 
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   Some services are just not intended to be run over the Internet -- even 
   if you decide it is something you really do need. We'll flag these
   as dangerous, and address these in later sections, should you decide 
   you do really need them, and there is no good alternative.

 read the <B

 in the Appendix, and understand how it works. Understanding exactly what each
 server is in the above example, and what it does, is beyond the scope of this
 document. You will have to check your system's documentation (e.g.
 Installation Guide, man pages, etc) if that service is important to you.  For
 example, does <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"exec"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"login"</SPAN
>, and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shell"</SPAN
> 
 sound important? Yes, but these are not what they may sound like. They 
 are actually <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rexec</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>, and
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rsh</B
>, the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"r"</SPAN
> (for remote) commands. These are 
 antiquated, unnecessary, and in fact, are very dangerous if exposed to the
 Internet.&#13;</P
><P
> Let's make a few quick assumptions about what is necessary and unnecessary,
 and therefore what goes and what stays on bigcat. Since we are running a
 desktop on bigcat, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X11</SPAN
> of course needs to stay. If
 bigcat were a dedicated server of some kind, then X11 would be unnecessary. If
 there is a printer physically attached, the printer (lp) daemon should stay.
 Otherwise, it goes. Print servers may sound harmless, but are potential
 targets too since they can hold ports open. If we plan on logging
 <EM
>in to</EM
> bigcat <EM
>from</EM
> other hosts,
 sshd (Secure SHell Daemon) would be necessary. If we have Microsoft hosts on
 our LAN, we probably want <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Samba</SPAN
>, so
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>smbd</SPAN
> should stay. Otherwise, it is completely
 unnecessary. Everything else in this example is optional and not required for
 a normally functioning system, and should probably go. See anything that you
 don't recognize? Not sure about? It goes!&#13;</P
><P
> To sum up: since bigcat is a desktop with a printer attached, we will 
 need <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"x11"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"printer"</SPAN
>. bigcat is on a LAN with 
 MS hosts, and shares files and printing with them, so
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"netbios-ssn"</SPAN
> (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbd</B
>) is desired. We will also
 need <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ssh"</SPAN

 is unnecessary for this particular case. &#13;</P
><P
> Nervous about this? If you want, you can make notes of any changes you make
 or save the list of servers you got from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>netstat</B

 this command: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>netstat -tap |grep LISTEN &#62; ~/services.lst</TT
>.
 That will save it your home directory with the name of
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"services.lst"</SPAN
> for future reference.</P
><P
> This is to not say that the ones we have decided to keep are inherently safe.
 Just that we probably need these. So we will have to deal with these via
 firewalling or other means (addressed below).&#13;</P
><P
> It is worth noting that the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
> and
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ftp</B
> daemons in the above example are
 <EM
>servers</EM
>, aka <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"listeners"</SPAN

 incoming connections to you. You do not need, or want, these just to use
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ftp</B

CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>
 <EM
>clients</EM

 FTP site with just an <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

 <SPAN

   Most installations on single computers will not really need this. If you are not
   going to be directly receiving mail from Internet hosts (as a designated MX

   needed. You may however need this if you are receiving mail

     The only time that this is actually required is if you are hosting a
     domain, and receiving incoming mail directly. Or possibly, for exchanging
     mail on a LAN, in which case it does not need Internet exposure and can
     be safely firewalled. For your ISP's POP mail access, you don't need it
     even though this is a common configuration. One alternative here is to
     use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>fetchmail</SPAN

     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-m</TT

     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fetchmail -m procmail</TT
> for instance works with no
     sendmail daemon running at all. Sendmail, can be handy to have running,
     but the point is, it is not required in many situations, and can be
     disabled, or firewalled safely.
