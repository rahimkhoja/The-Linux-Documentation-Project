</H2>

<P>
<P>>From "Matt Haycraft" Matt.Haycraft@dakotaimaging.com
<P>Both sides have the right thing show up with ifconfig and route but ping
(or anything else does not work) However what blows my mind is that the
ifconfig section for both machines DOES show that packets are being
received/transmitted.
<P>
<P>However it turned out to be a compatibility issue between 2.2.14 and
2.2.16 and the plip code for each kernel version.  2.2.16 had some
differences.  To address the issue, I copied the plip.c from the 2.2.16
kernel to the source tree of 2.2.14 and recompiled the kernel module.
Then everything worked!
