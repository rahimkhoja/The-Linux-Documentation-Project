<P>This document wants to explain something about Satellite technology, how
it works, what do you need, configuration and how to sharing it between several
clients. Satellite connections are very different from terrestrial ones, they
require more attention to setup and also some more care to maintain them stable
(snow or strong rain could prevent you to have a good signal).
