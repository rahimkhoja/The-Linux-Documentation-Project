For several years now, users at the Institution where I currently work part-time have expressed a need for a robust and secure connection to the internal network. The internal network actually has some clients that are on private networks and some clients that are Internet-routeable. </P>
<P>Being mostly a Microsoft shop, the options that have been available were not deemed appropriate for various reasons, usually due to security concerns.  After being introduced to the problem a few months ago and listening to the concerns surrounding it, I suggested using a boot CD, which would alleviate all of their security concerns. They gave me the go ahead to give it a try. I now have a working prototype and this document describes the process used to create it.</P>
