<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Glossary of Terms used in this document.</A></H2>

<P>The following is a list of some of the most important terms used in this
document.
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>ARP</B><DD><P>This is an acronym for the <EM>Address Resolution
Protocol</EM> and this is how a network machine associates an
IP Address with a hardware address.
<P>
<DT><B>ATM</B><DD><P>This is an acronym for <EM>Asynchronous Transfer
Mode</EM>.  An ATM network packages data into standard size
blocks which it can convey efficiently from point to
point. ATM is a circuit switched packet network technology.
<P>
<DT><B>client</B><DD><P>This is usually the piece of software at the end
of a system where the user is. There are exceptions to this,
for example, in the X11 window system it is actually the
server with the user and the client runs on the remote
machine. The client is the program or end of a system that is
receiving the service provided by the server. In the case of
<EM>peer to peer</EM> systems such as <EM>slip</EM> or <EM>ppp</EM> the
client is taken to be the end that initiates the connection
and the remote end, being called, is taken to be the server.
<P>
<DT><B>datagram</B><DD><P>A datagram is a discrete package of data and
headers which contain addresses, which is the basic unit of
transmission across an IP network. You might also hear this
called a `packet'.
<P>
<DT><B>DLCI</B><DD><P>The DLCI is the Data Link Connection Identifier and
is used to identify a unique virtual point to point connection
via a Frame Relay network. The DLCI's are normally assigned by
the Frame Relay network provider.
<P>
<DT><B>Frame Relay</B><DD><P>Frame Relay is a network technology ideally
suited to carrying traffic that is of bursty or sporadic
nature. Network costs are reduced by having many Frame Relay
customer sharing the same network capacity and relying on them
wanting to make use of the network at slightly different
times.
<P>
<DT><B>Hardware address</B><DD><P>This is a number that uniquely
identifies a host in a physical network at the media access
layer. Examples of this are <EM>Ethernet Addresses</EM> and
<EM>AX.25 Addresses</EM>.
<P>
<DT><B>ISDN</B><DD><P>This is an acronym for <EM>Integrated Services
Digital Network</EM>. ISDN provides a standardized means by
which Telecommunications companies may deliver either voice or
data information to a customers premises.  Technically ISDN is
a circuit switched data network.
<P>
<DT><B>ISP</B><DD><P>This is an acronym of Internet Service
Provider. These are organizations or companies that provide
people with network connectivity to the Internet.
<P>
<DT><B>IP address</B><DD><P>This is a number that uniquely identifies a
TCP/IP host on the network. The address is 4 bytes long and is
usually represented in what is called the "dotted decimal
notation", where each byte is represented in decimal from with
dots `.' between them.
<P>
<DT><B>MSS</B><DD><P>The Maximum Segment Size (<EM>MSS</EM>) is the
largest quantity of data that can be transmitted at one
time. If you want to prevent local fragmentation MSS would
equal MTU-IP header.
<P>
<DT><B>MTU</B><DD><P>The Maximum Transmission Unit (<EM>MTU</EM>) is a
parameter that determines the largest datagram than can be
transmitted by an IP interface without it needing to be broken
down into smaller units. The MTU should be larger than the
largest datagram you wish to transmit unfragmented. Note, this
only prevents fragmentation locally, some other link in the
path may have a smaller MTU and the datagram will be
fragmented there. Typical values are 1500 bytes for an
ethernet interface, or 576 bytes for a SLIP interface.
<P>
<DT><B>route</B><DD><P>The <EM>route</EM> is the path that your datagrams
take through the network to reach their destination.
<P>
<DT><B>server</B><DD><P>This is usually the piece of software or end of a
system remote from the user. The server provides some service
to one or many clients.  Examples of servers include <EM>ftp</EM>,
<EM>Networked File System</EM>, or <EM>Domain Name Server</EM>. In the
case of <EM>peer to peer</EM> systems such as <EM>slip</EM> or
<EM>ppp</EM> the server is taken to be the end of the link that is
called and the end calling is taken to be the client.
<P>
<DT><B>window</B><DD><P>The <EM>window</EM> is the largest amount of data
that the receiving end can accept at a given point in time.
