<P>The maintainer of the source for <CODE>ftape</CODE> is Claus Heine 
<A HREF="mailto:heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de">&lt;heine@math1.rwth-aachen.de&gt;</A>.  He has a web page at

<P>If you have a problem or questions about ftape, try posting to the
<CODE>Linux Tape</CODE> mailing list <CODE>linux-tape@vger.rutger.edu</CODE> (see 
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-4.html#tape-channel">Following the ftape development</A> below).  There
also used to be a newsgroup that mirrored the mailing list traffic but
it has vanished some time ago.
<P>I use <CODE>ftape</CODE> (it is my sole means of backing up on my linux box :-).
I hesitate to make recommendations on what hardware to buy.  See the
section 
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-6.html#supp_drives">Supported drives</A> and 
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-6.html#unsupp_drives">Unsupported drives</A> for a list of supported
and unsupported drives.
<P>You should try to post a summary of your problems and its solution(s),
after you've got it working, even if you only got it partially
working. Please also send a copy copy of your solution to the Linux Tape
mailing list at 
<A HREF="mailto:linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu">&lt;linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu&gt;</A> so that it can be added to
the HOWTO and/or the FAQ.
<P>If you receive this as part of a printed distribution or on a CD-ROM,
please check out 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/">the Linux Documentation home page</A> or ftp to
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/doc/HOWTO">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/doc/HOWTO</A> to see if there
exists a more recent version.  This could potentially save you a lot
of trouble.
<P>If you email me, please include the string <CODE>ftape</CODE> in the subject
line.  This will help ensure the mail doesn't inadvertently get
buried. But preferrably you should email to the Linux Tape mailing list
at 
<A HREF="mailto:linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu">&lt;linux-tape@vger.rutgers.edu&gt;</A> instead of contacting me
directly.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What is <CODE>ftape</CODE></A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> is a driver program that controls various low-cost tape
drives that connect to the floppy controller.
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> is not a backup program as such; it is a device driver,
which allows you to use the tape drive (just like the SoundBlaster 16
driver let you use your sound card) through the device files
<CODE>/dev/[n]qft[0-3]</CODE>.
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> was originally written by Bas Laarhoven
<CODE>&lt;bas@vimec.nl&gt;</CODE>, with ``a little help from his friends'' to
sort out the ECC (Error Correcting Code) stuff. <CODE>ftape</CODE> is
copyrighted by Bas under the GNU General Public License, which
basically says: ``go ahead and share this with the world, just don't
disallow other people from copying it further''.
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> has undergone several changes since then. While the
Linux-2.0.x kernel series still contains <CODE>ftape-2.08</CODE> the v2.1.x
and soon the v2.2.* kernel series come with <CODE>ftape-3.x</CODE> (hopefully
even with <CODE>ftape-4.02</CODE>, but this wasn't clear at the time of this
writing) which differs in some points from the <CODE>ftape-2.x</CODE> driver.
Since version <CODE>3.00</CODE> the <CODE>ftape</CODE> driver has been maintained by
me (Claus-Justus Heine); it has been changed and improved in several
respects and support for new hardware has been added.
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> is quite stable, and has been that for some time now.  It
is reliable enough for critical backups (but it's always a good idea
to check your backups, so you won't get a nasty surprise some day).
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> supports drives that conform to the QIC-117 and one of the
QIC-80, QIC-40, QIC-3010, and QIC-3020 standards as well as the Iomega
Ditto 2GB and Ditto Max drives which no longer strictly conform to the
QIC standards in all respects.
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> can drive floppy tape drives that connect to the internal FDC 
as well as certain parallel port floppy tape drives.
<P><CODE>ftape</CODE> supports neither QIC-02, IDE (ATAPI), nor SCSI tape
drives.  SCSI drives are accessed as <CODE>/dev/[n]st[0-7]</CODE> and are
supported by the kernel through the SCSI drivers.  If you look for
help on SCSI tape drives, you should read the <CODE>SCSI-howto</CODE>.
ATAPI tape drives are supported by the kernel since 1.3.46.  See
section 
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-6.html#supp_drives">Supported drives</A> and 
<A HREF="Ftape-HOWTO-6.html#unsupp_drives">Unsupported drives</A> for a list of supported
and unsupported drives.
