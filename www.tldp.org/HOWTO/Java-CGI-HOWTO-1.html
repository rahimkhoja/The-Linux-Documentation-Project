<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>Because of the way that Java is designed the programmer does not have
easy access to the system's environment variables.
Because of the way that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is set up, 
it is necessary to use multiple tokens to invoke a program,
which does not mesh very well with the standard HTML forms/CGI
manner of operations.
There are ways around these limitations, and I have implemented one of
them.
Read further for details.
<P>Since I wrote the previous paragraph in 1996, there have been many
changes in the Java technology.
It is likely that a better solution to running server-side Java programs
is now available -- perhaps you should take a look at servlets.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Prior Knowledge</A>
</H2>

<P>I am assuming that you have a general knowledge of HTML and CGI concepts
and at least a minimal knowledge of your HTTP server.
You should also know how to program in Java, or a lot of this will not make
sense.
