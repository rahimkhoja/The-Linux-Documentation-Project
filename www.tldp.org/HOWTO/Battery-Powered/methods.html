For example, the following provides 32-bit IO support with sync (-c3), DMA 
support (-d1), Advanced Power Management (-B128), write-caching
(-W1), disk spin down after five minutes (-S60).     gains me tremendous 
performance with added power savings.  Note that your mileage may vary, and 
you'll want to adjust this for your specific system to prevent data loss 
(especially the -B and -m flags!).</P

>In the following example, we run some read/write benchmarks of our hard 
drive before and after using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hdparm</B
>.
Note that while our cache reads remain about the same, our actual physical 
reads from the drive increase tremendously!
If you like living on the edge, you can play with the -m, -c, -B, and -u 
switches with caution (see the man page).</P

disabling
disk syncing (to prevent data loss in the event of a system crash).</P

>Compile your kernel with tmpfs (temporary file system) enabled and mount 
your /tmp directory using it.
The useful bit here is that nothing will be written to your hard drive on this 
mount point as it will act like
a RAM disk (however nothing will be saved either).  The advantage of tmpfs 
over the more traditional ramfs is
that it lives in the kernel internal cache and grows and shrinks to 
accommodate the files placed there.
See your kernel's Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt for full information.  
If you don't specify a maximum
size, it will default to a ceiling limit of half your available memory.  
An example /etc/fstab with 100MB temporary ram file mounted on /tmp would look 
like:
