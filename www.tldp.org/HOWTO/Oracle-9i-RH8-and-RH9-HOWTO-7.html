<P>Oracle 9i is a huge complex with very useful, and most of all very
secure applications. This document slightly touches the surface and
is not intended to be a comprehensive guide. I hope that it can help
solving some problems during the initial installation, but it is important to
analyze your own situation and turn to more reliable sources.
<P>Some of the operations could be executed manually using SQL*Plus.
This could be a more flexible way to tune and set up the installation.
I will leave this in more experience hands.
<P>I haven't mentioned so many things, that are described in details in
Oracle documentation itself. So explore the genuine source in depth!
<P>Good luck!
