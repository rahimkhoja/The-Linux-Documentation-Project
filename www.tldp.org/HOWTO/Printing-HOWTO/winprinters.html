>12. Windows-only printers</H1
><P
>As I discussed earlier, some printers are inherently unsupported
because they don't speak a normal printer language, instead using
the computer's CPU to render a bitmap which is then piped to the
printer at a fixed speed.  In a few cases, these printers also
speak something normal like PCL, but often they do not.  In some
   (really low-end) cases, the printer doesn't even use a normal
parallel connection but relies on the vendor's driver to emulate
what should be hardware behavior (most importantly flow control).</P
><P
>In any case, there are a few possible workarounds if you find
yourself stuck with such a lemon.</P

>12.1. The Ghostscript Windows redirector</H2
><P
>There is now a Ghostscript printer driver available (called <B
CLASS="command"
>mswinpr2</B
>) that will print using Windows GDI
calls.  There is also a port redirection tool called <B
CLASS="command"
>redmon</B
> which will run a print job through
Ghostscript before finally printing it.  (Rather like an <TT
CLASS="option"
>if</TT
> filter in Unix's LPD).  Taken all together,
this allows a Windows machine to print PostScript to a
Windows-only printer through the vendor's driver.</P
><P
>If you have a host-based printer that can't be used directly, you
can export it as a "Postscript" printer by using redmon,
Ghostscript, and mswinpr2 on a Windows PC and print through the
vendor's drivers.</P

>12.2. HP Winprinters</H2
><P
>Some HP printers use "Printing Performance Architecture"
    (marketing speak for "we were too cheap to implement PCL").  This
is supported in a roundabout way via the pbm2ppa translator
written by Tim Norman.  Basically, you use ghostscript to render
PostScript into a bitmapped image in pbm format and then use
pbm2ppa to translate this into a printer-specific ppa format
bitmap ready to be dumped to the printer.  This program may also
come in ghostscript driver format by now.</P
><P
>The ppa software can be had from <A
HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/~normat/technical/ppa/"
TARGET="_top"
>the ppa home
page</A
>; pbm2ppa supports some models of the HP 720, 820,
and 1000; read the documentation that comes with the package for
more details on ppa printer support.</P

>12.3. Lexmark Winprinters</H2
><P
>Most of the cheap Lexmark inkjets use a proprietary language and
are therefore Winprinters.  However, Henryk Paluch has written a
program which can print on a Lexmark 7000.  Hopefully he'll be
able to figure out color and expand support to other Lexmark
inkjets.  See <A
HREF="http://bimbo.fjfi.cvut.cz/~paluch/l7kdriver/"
TARGET="_top"
>here</A
>
for more info.</P
><P
>Similarly, there are now drivers for the 5700, 1000, 1100, 2070,
3200, and others.  See the supported printers listing above, and
my web site, for more information on obtaining these drivers.</P
