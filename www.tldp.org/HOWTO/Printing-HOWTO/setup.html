>For common configurations, you can probably ignore this section
entirely - instead, you should jump straight to <A
HREF="vendors.html"
>Section 9</A
> below, or better yet, your vendor's
documentation.  Most GNU/Linux distributions supply one or more
   "idiot-proof" tools to do everything described here for common
printers.</P
><P
>If your vendor's tool doesn't work out for you, or you'd like the
ability to interactively control printing options when you print,
then you should use some other system. APS Filter
is another good system; it configures LPD queues and filters very
easily on most any sort of Unix system.</P
><P
>You can also use the printing system interfaces from the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>linuxprinting.org website</A
>
to connect many free drivers into several spooling systems. Once
this project is complete, these interfaces will offer the best
functionality: all styles of free software drivers are supported,
user-settable options are available, and most common spooling
systems are supported. Currently the foomatic print system is used in most modern distributions anyway. However, your distro may include a slightly outdated version of foomatic.</P

>8.1. Configuring CUPS</H2
><P
>If you are using a client with CUPS and a CUPS server has already been configured, installing the printers on your client can not get much easier than this: do nothing. Through broadcasting, the client should find the CUPS server and automatically configure the printers that are installed on that print server. This is one of the features of CUPS that will be really appreciated on large networks.</P
><P
>Manually configuring printers with CUPS, also is a peace of cake. If you are new to CUPS and/or Unix printing, the way to go is probably the web interface. If you have to configure lots of printers, using the command-line will probably be faster.</P
><P
>The URL to access the CUPS web interface is http://hostname:631/admin by default. The port can be changed in cupsd.conf if necessary.</P
><P
>To add a printer from the command-line the general syntax is
<B
CLASS="command"
>lpadmin -p printer -E -v device -m ppd</B
>
Lpadmin with the -p option adds or modifies a printer. The printers are saved in the file
The -x option deletes the named printer. Read the lpadmin man page for available options.

extension of the above linefeed-fixing filter.</P

point or a nearly complete solution, depending on your needs.
Medium to large environments can be well supported by native LPRng
features.
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Each printer should have a single point of control, where an
administrator can pause, reorder, or redirect the queue.  To
implement this, have everyone printing to a local server,
which will then queue jobs and direct them to the proper
printer.  For large campuses or distributed networks, have one
server per building or other suitable network subset.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Use CUPS or LPRng, at least on servers; the BSD LPD is too buggy for
       "real" use. But don't take my word for it&#8212;you should test a number of
spoolers and see which suits you best.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Client systems should not have unique printing configurations. CUPS provides automatic client configuration of printers on the same subnet. You can even configure CUPS (BrowsePoll) to poll servers on other subnets for available printers. These features limit the amount of configuration that needs to take place at the client.
To implement a uniform printing configuration with LPRng, use LPRng's extended printcap syntax so
that you have one printcap to use everywhere.  CEPS provides
for this by building atop a lightweight distributed database
instead of traditional printcap files.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Print queues should not be named for make or model; name print
queues for something sensible like location (floor2_nw)
or capability (color_transparency).  Three years from
now, when a printer breaks, you will be able to replace it
with a different make or model without causing confusion.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Operate a web page which shows detailed information on each
printer, including location, capabilities, etc.  Consider
having it show the queue and include a button to remove jobs
from the queue.  Complex networked environments are
unmanageable for users without proper documentation.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>On Windows and Apple systems, use either the platform-specific
drivers <EM
>everywhere</EM
> (Samba supports the
Windows automagical driver-download mechanism) or, better, use
generic Postscript drivers <EM

>.  Do
not mix and match; primitive word processors often produce
different output when the installed printer driver changes;
users cannot deal with output that varies depending on the
particular client/printer pair.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If at all possible, buy a large-volume printer for
large-volume printing.  If on a budget, use LPRng's multiple
printers/one queue facility or CUPS printer classes and assign a babysitter; printers
are complex mechanical devices that will often jam and run out
of paper in such configurations.</P

Ethernet "print servers" now cost under $100.  The ability to
locate printers anywhere you can network is a big improvement
over forced location near a host; locate printers in sensible,
central locations.</P

>Use any SNMP trap or other monitoring/alert facility available
to you - someone should be tasked with running around and
fixing printers with no ink or paper.  Npadmin (see <A
HREF="network.html#npadmin"
>Section 11.10.1</A
>) can be used to do some management
operations with SNMP printers.</P

>Regular LPD provides very little to help you with accounting.  You
can specify the name of an accounting file in the <TT
CLASS="option"
>af</TT
> printcap attribute, but this is merely passed
as an argument to your <TT
CLASS="option"
>if</TT
> filter.  It's up to you
to make your <TT
CLASS="option"
>if</TT
> filter write entries to the
accounting file, and up to you to process the accounting file
later (the traditional format is mainly useful for line printers,
and is nontrivial to parse in Perl, so there's no reason to
preserve it).  Also, if you're using <B
CLASS="command"
>foomatic-rip</B
> program as your filter, you'll need
to make changes, since it depends on being given a configuration
file as the ``accounting'' file name.</P
><P
>CUPS provides page accounting by passing jobs through the pstops filter. This filter expects Postscript input. If you use print "raw" jobs, this is always counted as 1 page. This means that accounting will not work, if you print from Windows client with the native printer driver.</P
><P
>&#13;Ghostscript provides a PageCount operator that you can use to
count the number of pages in each job; basically you just tack a
few lines of postscript onto the end of the job to write an
accounting file entry; for the best example of this see the file<TT
CLASS="filename"
>unix-lpr.sh</TT
> in the Ghostscript source
distribution.</P
><P
>Note that the <B
CLASS="command"
>unix-lpr</B
> implementation of
accounting writes to a file from the Ghostscript interpreter, and
is thus incompatible with the recommended -dSAFER option.  A
better solution might be to query the printer with a PJL command
after each job, or to write a postscript snippet that prints the
pagecount on stdout, where it can be captured without having to
write to a file.</P
><P
>&#13;The LPRng print spooler includes an HP-specific sample
implementation of accounting; I assume that it queries the
printer with PJL.  This technique should work for most PJL,
Postscript, or SNMP printers with which you have two-way
communications.</P
><P
>If you have a networked printer that supports SNMP, you can use
the npadmin program to query a pagecount after each job.  This
should work properly for all print jobs.  See <A
HREF="network.html#npadmin"
>Section 11.10.1</A
> for more information on npadmin.</P
