>There are two completely different device drivers for the parallel
port; which one you are using depends on your kernel version (which
you can find out with the command <TT
CLASS="literal"
>uname
   -a</TT
>).  The driver changed in Linux 2.1.33; essentially all
current systems will be running kernel 2.2 or later, so you'll
probably want to skip ahead to the parport driver section.</P
><P
>A few details are the same for both styles of driver.  Most
notably, many people have found that Linux will not detect their
parallel port unless they disable "Plug and Play" in their PC BIOS.
   (This is no surprise; the track record for PnP of non-PCI devices
with Windows and elsewhere has been something of a disaster).</P

>The Linux kernel (&#60;=2.1.32), assuming you have compiled in or
loaded the lp device (the output of <TT
CLASS="literal"

loaded), provides one or more of <EM
>/dev/lp0</EM
>,<EM
>/dev/lp1</EM
>, and <EM
>/dev/lp2</EM
>.
These are NOT assigned dynamically, rather, each corresponds to a
specific hardware I/O address.  This means that your first printer
may be <EM
>lp0</EM
> or <EM
>lp1</EM
>
depending on your hardware.  Just try both.</P
><P
>A few users have reported that their bidirectional lp ports aren't
detected if they use an older unidirectional printer cable.  Check
that you've got a decent cable.</P
><P
>One cannot run the plip and lp drivers at the same time on any
given port (under 2.0, anyway).  You can, however, have one or the
other driver loaded at any given time either manually, or by
kerneld with version 2.x (and later 1.3.x) kernels.  By carefully
setting the interrupts and such, you can supposedly run plip on
one port and lp on the other.  One person did so by editing the
drivers; I eagerly await a success report of someone doing so with
only a clever command line.</P

LILO/LOADLIN command line to set the port addresses and interrupts
that the driver will use.

Syntax:      lp=port0[,irq0[,port1[,irq1[,port2[,irq2]]]]]

For example:   lp=0x378,0   or   lp=0x278,5,0x378,7 **

Note that if this feature is used, you must specify *all* the ports
you want considered, there are no defaults.  You can disable a
built-in driver with lp=0.</PRE

>4.2. The parport device (kernels &#62;= 2.1.33)</H2
><P
>Beginning with kernel 2.1.33 (and available as a patch for kernel
2.0.30), the lp device is merely a client of the new parport
device.  The addition of the parport device corrects a number of
the problems that plague the old lp device driver - it can share
the port with other drivers, it dynamically assigns available
parallel ports to device numbers rather than enforcing a fixed
correspondence between I/O addresses and port numbers, and so
forth.</P
><P
>The advent of the parport device has enabled a whole flock of new
parallel-port drivers for things like Zip drives, Backpack CD-ROMs
and disks, and so forth.  Some of these are also available in
versions for 2.0 kernels; look around on the web.</P
><P
>The main difference that you will notice, so far as printing goes,
is that parport-based kernels dynamically assign lp devices to
parallel ports.  So what was lp1 under Linux 2.0 may well be lp0
under Linux 2.2.  Be sure to check this if you upgrade from an
lp-driver kernel to a parport-driver kernel.</P

>Many PC BIOSes will make the parallel port into a Plug-and-Play device.  This just adds needless complexity to a
perfectly simple device that is nearly always present; turn
off the PnP setting for your parallel port ("LPT1" in many
BIOSes) if your parallel port isn't detected by the Linux
driver.  The correct setting is often called "legacy", "ISA",
or "0x378", but probably not "disabled".</P

extended attributes and configure IRQs and I/O addresses for
non-standard ports.  Further discussion of serial ports under
Linux may be found in the <A
HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Serial-HOWTO</A
>.</P
><P
>When using a slow serial printer with flow control, you may find
that some of your print jobs get truncated.  This may be due to
the serial port, whose default behavior is to purge any
untransmitted characters from its buffer 30 seconds after the port
device is closed.  The buffer can hold up to 4096 characters, and
if your printer uses flow control and is slow enough that it can't
accept all the data from the buffer within 30 seconds after
printing software has closed the serial port, the tail end of the
buffer's contents will be lost.  If the command <TT
CLASS="literal"
>cat file &#62; /dev/ttyS2</TT
> produces complete
printouts for short files but truncated ones for longer files, you
may have this condition.</P
><P
>The 30 second interval can be adjusted through the
    "closing_wait" command-line option of setserial (version
2.12 and later).  A machine's serial ports are usually initialized
by a call to setserial in the rc.serial boot file.  The call for
the printing serial port can be modified to set the
closing_wait at the same time as it sets that port's other
parameters.</P

>4.4.3. Hints</H3
><P
>One thing to remember is that USB devices are dynamically allocated. A USB printer gets assigned a device file (/dev/usb/lp*) when it is turned on or connected. This could mean that print jobs are sent to the wrong printer because you turned them on in a certain order. CUPS uses special Uri's containing manufacturer, model and printer serial number to keep sending the jobs to the correct physical printer.</P
><P
>Although most USB printers work fine on Linux, there are exceptions. For example the new MF devices from Epson (Stylus CX3200/CX5200) return garbage when one polls the IEEE-1284 ID string via IOCTL, for example 
with the code of the CUPS "usb" backend. Whereas one can poll the ID string via an Epson-proprietary method.</P
><P
>Till Kamppeter has written some tools to retrieve the device ID string from USB printers. <A

>getusbprinterid.pl</A
> and <A
HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/printing/usb_id/test.c"

> are the same thing but respectively in Perl and C. As mentioned above, the new MF devices from Epson are an exception, but the "Epson proprietary method" is implemented in the ttink tool of the <A
