>In order to get printing working well, you need to understand how your 
spooling software works.  All systems work in essentially the same
way, although the exact order might vary a bit, and some systems
skip a step or two:<DIV

job, and translates the job data into the printer's native
language, which is usually not Postscript.  This step is called <EM

things up lies in getting the proper filtering to happen.</P
></LI

cleanup things at this point.  If there was an error along the
way, the spooler will usually notify the user somehow (for
example, by email).</P

>Initially CUPS lacked an LPD backend. This was of course quickly added. Currently there are backends available for at least IPP, LPD, SMB, JetDirect, USB, Netatalk, parallel and serial printers. You may find others on the net or write your own.</P
><P
>There are only a handfull of built-in drivers, allowing you to print with most printers but probably not at the maximum resolution. A PPD file for a Postscript driver can be added to CUPS but if you want to print at best quality with your fancy new HP Deskjet you are out of luck. It is here that Foomatic comes to the rescue. You can use Foomatic in combination with CUPS. Foomatic uses a CUPS filter called foomatic-rip to do its magic. foomatic-rip uses PPD files to describe printer capabilities, even for non-Postscript printers. CUPS + Foomatic is currently the recommended printing system. Some Linux distributions already use it and the number that do will only grow.</P
><P
>The CUPS scheduler does not only accept jobs, it is also a administrative webinterface. Currently you can add/delete printers, cancel jobs, start/stop printers. Moving jobs will be available in a later release.</P

>Ghostscript is a host-based Postscript interpreter (aka a

graphics formats.  Ghostscript is covered in <A

component.  It filters Postscript, executing a few basic
transformations on it (n-up printing, multiple copies, etc)
and adding in user option statements according to a Postscript
Printer Definition (PPD) file usually included with Postscript
printers.</P

><B
CLASS="command"

option-accepting LPD system (like the GNUlpr, or LPRng)
and a filter script which parses user-provided options into
the equivalent <B

>ppdfilt</B
> command.  VA Linux
and HP provide a modified rhs-printfilters package which does
exactly this; it produces nice results if you have a
Postscript printer.  See <A
