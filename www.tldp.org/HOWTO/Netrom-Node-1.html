<P>It is possible, using just the ax25-util's to generate node
listings for the Node application and the FBB BBS and the DXNet DX
Cluster. This is done by changing the configuration files for Netrom
and making a Netrom entry for each application. At present there is a
kernel imposed limit of 4 Netrom entries. The new kernels are
expected to drop this limit.
<P>Now users look for CRUCES:K5DI-4 and LCBBS:K5DI-3 and
LCDX:K5DI-5 on the many nodes here in New Mexico, Texas and Arizona
and are connected like magic. They no longer need to remember
anything.
