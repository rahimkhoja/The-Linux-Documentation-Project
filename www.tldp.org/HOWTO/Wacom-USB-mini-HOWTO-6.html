<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Having 2 mouses on the same system</A>
 </H2>

<P>Have you ever dreamed of having 2 mouses on your system ? If the answer
is yes, do the following.
<P>Edit the file <B>/etc/XF86Config</B>
<P>The modules section should look like this
<P><B>Section "Module"</B>
<P><B>Load "xf86Wacom.so"</B>
<P><B>EndSection</B>
<P>Then check the XInput section :
<P><B>Section "XInput"</B>
<P><B>SubSection "Mouse"</B>
<P><B>DeviceName "WacomTablet"</B> --&gt; or whatever you like
<P><B>Protocol "IMPS/2"</B> --&gt; I didn't manage to have imwheel recognize the wheel,
but if you do, drop me an email
<P><B>Port "/dev/input/mouse0"</B>
<P><B>Buttons 5</B>
<P><B>ZAxisMapping 4 5</B>
<P><B>AlwaysCore</B> --&gt; means that the Wacom mouse is always considered as the
core pointer, ie if you move your normal mouse or the Wacom mouse (or stylus),
it'll be just the same.
<P><B>EndSubSection</B>
<P><B>EndSection</B>
<P>And there you are, the Wacom mouse (or stylus) is now considered as a second
mouse, but your normal one still works.
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Now on to the real stuff</A>
 </H2>

<P>Back to the XInput section, after the parameters for the mouse, here is
the real Wacom stuff :
<P><B>SubSection "WacomStylus"</B>
<P><B>Port "/dev/input/event0"</B> --&gt; the USB event device
<P><B>DeviceName "WacomStylus"</B> --&gt; or whatever you want to call it
<P><B>Mode Absolute</B> --&gt; ie the tablet surface is equivalent to the screen
surface
<P><B>#Suppress 6</B>
<P><B>DebugLevel 10</B> --&gt; once everything works, set it to 0
<P><B>#TiltMode</B>
<P><B>#HistorySize 200</B>
<P><B>#AlwaysCore</B>
<P><B>#KeepShape</B>
<P><B>#TopX 20412</B> --&gt; the 4 lines are used to fine-tune the coordinate
to fit with the screen
<P><B>#TopY 14730</B>
<P><B>#BottomX 0</B>
<P><B>#BottomY 0</B>
<P><B>EndSubSection</B>
<P><B>SubSection "WacomEraser"</B>
<P><B>DeviceName "/dev/input/event0"</B>
<P><B>DeviceName "WacomEraser"</B>
<P><B>Mode Absolute</B>
<P><B>EndSubSection</B>
<P><B>SubSection "WacomCursor"</B>
<P><B>Port "/dev/input/event0"</B>
<P><B>DeviceName "GraphireMouse"</B>
<P><B>Mode Absolute</B>
<P><B>EndSubSection</B>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 The new module</A>
 </H2>

<P>The xf86Wacom.so is not specifically written for the USB tablets, and it's
even not working correctly with these tablets. A new driver has been written
by Matsumura Namihiko &lt;po-jp@geocities.co.jp&gt; has written one named xf86WacomUSB
(available as source code at the same location than this Mini-HOWTO). However,
to be able to compile it, you'll need the kernel source code and the source
tree for XFree86 (I compiled it with success against XFree86 3.3.5, but it
should compile with 3.3.6).
<P>This driver doesn't handle all the possibilities of the tablet, and crashes
if you pass it the <B>AlwaysCore</B> parameter.
<P>To correct this, I'll keep in touch with Frederic Lepied for a modification
of the original module to have it handle all of the possibilities of the tablet.
<P><B>**NEWS** At Frederic Lepied's site, you'll find a link to a new USB driver
that works perfectly well, but exclusively with the possibility to have your
tablet working as a mouse : ie either you use your tablet in The Gimp to draw,
or you use it as an XFree mouse, but not both together. I'll investigate further,
and update this document accordingly.</B>
