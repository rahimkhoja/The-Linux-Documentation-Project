>Linux gets ragged on a lot because we don't have the wealth of games that other platforms
	have.  Frankly, there's enough games for me, although it would be really nice to have some of the
	bleeding edge games and classics like Half-life and Carmageddon.  Fortunately, we have more
	emulators than you can shake a stick at.  Although playing an emulated game is sometimes not quite
	as fun as playing it on the native machine, and getting some of the emulators to work well can be
	a difficult task, they're here, and there's alot of them!</P

>10.1. What is a virtual machine?</H2
><P
><A
NAME="VM"
></A
>A "real computer" provides an operating system many things, including a
			CPU, I/O channels, memory, a BIOS to provide low level access to motherboard and I/O
			resources, etc. When an operating system wants to write to a hard drive, it communicates
			through a device driver that interfaces directly with the hardware device memory.</P
><P
>However, it's possible to give a program all the hardware resources it needs.  When it
			wants to access a hard drive, give it some memory to write to.  When it wants to set an IRQ,
			give it some bogus instructions that lets it think it set an IRQ.  If you do this correctly,
			then in principle, there's no way for the poor application to know whether it's really
			accessing hardware or tricked by being given resources which simulate hardware.  A virtual
			machine is the environment which tricks applications into believing they're running on a real
			computer.  It provides all the services that a real computer would provide.</P
><P
>VM's were used initially in the 1960's to emulate time shared operating systems, but
			these days we use them to run software which was written for foreign operating systems, or
			more commonly, an entire operating system.  Because of the nature of the VM, the foreign OS
			can't tell the difference between operating in a VM or in a "real" machine.</P

			the ROMs for the Apple ][, ][+, ][e, ][c and //gs.   They are still copyrighted by Apple, and
			you can only use them legally if you actually own one of these computers.</P

>&#62;, which bears the GNUish
					acronym "Wine Is Not An Emulator" is a non-commercial implementation of the Win32 API.
					The reason why it's not an emulator is subtle and not of much interest to most non
					computer scientists, so we'll call it an emulator here (it really does run-time
					translation of calls to the Win32 API to POSIX/X11 calls).  Wine has come a long way, and
					is capable of emulating many important programs, which is great news for Linux users who
					want this sort of stuff.</P
><P
>Wine does <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>not</TT
> provide the DOS API, so you can't use it
					to run DOS applications.  For that, you should look at dosemu (<A
HREF="x809.html#DOSEMU"
>Section 10.3.1</A
>).
					Wine has never been too good at implementing DirectX, although a number of games are known
					to work under wine.  For gaming you might want to look at winex (<A
HREF="x809.html#WINEX"
>Section 10.5.3</A
>).</P
><P
>In addition to run-time translation of the Win32 API to POSIX/X11 (it runs Windows
					applications on Linux), wine also does compile-time tranlation of the Win32 API to
					POSIX/X11 (it compiles Windows application source code on Linux).  In this sense, wine is
					a Windows-to-Linux porting utility.  The x86 architecture isn't required, but is
					recommended since it allows actual x86 binary execution as well as direct DLL
					usage).</P
><P
>You can use wine `with Windows', which means that wine uses libraries that actually
					come with Microsoft Windows itself.  This is legal only if you own a copy of Windows which
					isn't currently being used on a computer.  It's said that wine has the best success when
					run with Windows.   You can also run wine without Windows.  The people at <A
HREF="http://www.winehq.com"

					want winex developers to work on.  For instance, they can vote for things like "Improve

					8.0 support".  As far as I can see, the developers really do listen to the subscriber
					polls.</P

>The Transgaming website has a few user support forums.  On one hand, they
					use the most godawful, horrible, confusing, wasteful, moronic format I've ever seen and I
					hope to god I never see a forum with a format as bad as Transgaming's.  On the other hand,
					you can ask for help and the developers are VERY good about getting around to your answer;
					their vigilance is quite impressive.  Non-subscribers can browse the forums, but only
					subscribers can post (and therefore, ask for support).</P

>The developers of winex were going to release their Installshield, DirectX and
					DirectDraw enhancements to wine "every so often".  In return, as wine maturation improved,
					the winex developers were going to take the new versions of wine and use them for winex.
					However, since the birth of Transgaming, parts of wine have been re-licensed under the
					more restrictive GNU LGPL license (<A
HREF="x809.html#WINE"
>Section 10.5.1</A
>).  This basically means that
					versions of wine that are released past the date of the re-licensing can no longer be used

>wine</A
>, you'll probably get the most success with <A
HREF="x809.html#WINEX"
>winex</A

HREF="x809.html#WIN4LIN"
>Win4Lin</A

					<A
HREF="x809.html#VMWARE"
>VMWare</A
> instead of an emulator. If your goal is to run
					Win95/98/ME applications on Linux, without USB and on the x86 architecture, Win4Lin's cost
					and focus on Win95 type OS's make it a better choice than vmware. However, if you must
					have USB support or run Linux on a platform other than x86, vmware is your only
					option.</P
><P
>Now if your goal is to run Win95 type OS games under Linux, Win4Lin almost seems
					better than vmware.  The show-stopper is the fact that vmware has limited DirectX support
					while Win4Lin has none.  This fact alone makes both Win4Lin and vmware unsuitable for most
					hardcore gaming purposes.  But if you're going to give it a try, you're more likely to
					have success with vmware.</P
