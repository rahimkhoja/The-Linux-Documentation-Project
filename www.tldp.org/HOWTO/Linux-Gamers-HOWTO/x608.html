>7.1. History</H2
><P
>Once upon a time, a company in San Jose, California named 3dfx Interactive was king of
			the gaming video card market.  In October 1996 they released the Voodoo I, which was a
			phenomenal success.  It was the first hardware accelerated card, but only rendered 3D; it had
			to be piggybacked with a 2D video card.  The idea was that 2D rendering was handled by a high
			quality 2D video card (Matrox was immensely popular at the time) but 3D information (see
			Glide2, <A
HREF="x130.html#GLIDE2"
>Section 3.1</A
>) would be passed to the Voodoo I and rendered, using the
			Voodoo's fast hardware to perform the necessary graphics calculations.  They released the
			Voodoo Rush in April 1996.  It should've been a more powerful card, with a 50MHz GPU and 8MB
			of RAM.  Even better, it was their first combined 2D/3D card, meaning that it freed up a
			valuable PCI slot (most PC's only had a couple of PCI slots back then) but the Rush wasn't as
			popular.  3dfx removed the multi-texturing unit from the Rush, and it was outperformed by the
			Voodoo I.  At the time, ATI had their Rage series and nVidia had their Riva 128, but the
			Voodoo I blew them all away.</P
><P
>This was a good time for Linux.  id Software's open sourced the Doom codebase and ported
			Quake I to Linux (December 1996).  We were getting our first tastes of real commercial gaming.
			Life was simple: you purchased a Voodoo.  And it felt good, because 3dfx open sourced their
			drivers.  The king of video cards worked with Linux developers.  Not only did we have the best
			video cards, but the drivers were all open source.</P
><P
>In March 1998, 3dfx released their Voodoo II, with its 3.6GB/sec memory bandwith, 12MB
			of video memory and 90MHz core.  It supported resolutions up to 1024x768.  This was 3dfx in
			its heyday.  Like the Voodoo I, the Voodoo II was a 3D only card, and piggy backed with a 2D
			video card.  The Voodoo Banshee was released in September 1998 as a combined 2D/3D card, like
			the Rush.  Despite the faster 100MHz core, the Banshee was outperformed by the Voodoo II
			because its multi-texturing unit was removed, like with the Rush.  And again like the Rush, it
			wasn't popular.  But 3dfx reigned supreme, and nobody could touch them.</P
><P
>In April 1999, the Voodoo III was released.  There were a number of Voodoo III's,
			ranging from a 143MHz core speed to 183MHz.  There were TV-out versions.  There were PCI and
			AGP versions (it was the first AGP video card).  It was another success, but 3dfx began to
			lose ground to nVidia, which released their TNT 2.  The TNT 2 outperformed the Voodoo II, and
			accelerated 3D graphics at full 32 bit color, while the Voodoo's were stuck at 16 bit color.
			But life was still good for Linux.  We had a card that was almost neck-to-neck with nVidia,
			our drivers were open source, and in December 1999, id Software gave us a huge gift: they open
			sourced the Quake I codebase.</P
><P
>Then nVidia released the GeForce 256 in October 1999.  3dfx's Voodoo IV, its direct
			competitor, was about a year late which is very bad when you're competing for a bleeding edge
			market.  While nVidia was putting real R&#38;D into their cards, 3dfx was simply adding more
			and faster RAM.  The Voodoo IV and V rendered in full 32bpp color, had great AA support (<A
HREF="x608.html#AA"
>Section 7.4.3</A
>), featured a 2nd GPU, more memory, and was arguably the king of of video cards.
			However, 3dfx's late release of the Voodoo IV and V coupled with the fact that the GeForce
			could be had for half the price meant that 3dfx was sinking fast.  For Linux, the newest
			Voodoo's could only accelerate at 16 and 24 bit color.  Worse still, the Voodoo V's 2nd GPU
			was unused by the Linux driver (and to this day, the Voodoo V is functionally equivalent to
			the single GPU Voodoo IV on Linux).  Most Windows users were switching to nVidia, and despite
			the fact that the nVidia drivers were proprietary, even Linux users began to jump onto the
			nVidia bandwagon.  VA Linux, the largest Linux server vendor, put nVidia into their
			machines.</P
><P
>Then in April 2000, 3dfx was attacked on a different front: ATI started releasing their
			first generation Radeons.  Until this point, ATI had always been an innovative (they developed
			their own 3D acceleration chips in 1996, about the same time as 3dfx), but sleepy graphics
			chipset manufacturer.  The Radeons were their first 3D accelerated card that gamers took any
			real serious interest in.  Their Radeons trounced both nVidia and 3dfx.  They worked with
			Linux developers, open sourced all their drivers and were hailed as the great hope for Linux
			gaming.  nVidia came back with fists swinging, and this was all too much for 3dfx.  Between
			losing the benchmark wars to the GeForce and Radeon, their lateness with new cards and high
			prices, 3dfx lost its market share and didn't have the funds to stay into business.  On April
			18 2001, they sold most of their assets and technology to nVidia, and in October 2002, they
			finally declared bankruptcy.</P
><P
>The demise of 3dfx was quite sudden and a slap in the face to the open source community.
			I still remember my friend Gabe Rosa emailing me with just "<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Look at /.</TT
>" and
			seeing the news.  It was the 2nd worst day for Linux gaming (the 1st being the demise of
			Loki).  And it was also a shame.  3dfx was getting ready to release a new Voodoo V featuring 4
			GPU's which would've trounced the ATI and  nVidia offerings, as well as a new card code named
			"Rampage" which reportedly would've put them firmly back as the king of the hill.  There are
			reports that the Rampage's technology (which was sold to nVidia) went into the GeForce 5900.
			Not too shabby for 3 year old technology!</P
><P
>At first, things were still simple.  Linux gamers would either keep their open source
			Voodoos, get an open source Radeon or a closed source GeForce.  However, with bigger and
			better games on the horizon, it was only a matter of time before the Voodoos would no longer
			be a viable graphics card for modern gaming.  People were still using Voodoo's, but they were
			essentially out of the game at this point.</P
><P
>ATI started to release a tremendous number of versions of each video card, and keeping
			up with them and their terminology started to become very difficult.  ATI, together with
			nVidia, played king of hill.  Their products have been neck to neck ever since, with GeForce
			taking the lead a bit more times than the Radeon.  But the Radeon's drivers were open source,
			so many Linux users stuck by them.  Then things got even more complicated.</P
><P
>ATI started becoming more and more reluctant to open source drivers for their new
			releases, and suddenly, it wasn't clear who the "good guy" was anymore.  nVidia's party line
			was they license some of their GL code from another company, and is thus non-releasable.
			Presumably, ATI doesn't want to release drivers to keep their trade secrets, well, a secret.
			And it gets worse.  The ATI Linux drivers have been plagued by extremely poor performance.
			Even when an ATI offering is better than the current GeForce offering for Windows, the card is
			always trounced by GeForce on Linux.  Because of the ATI Linux driver woes, Linux users cannot
			use MS Windows based benchmarks or card stats.  They simply don't apply to us.  And that's
			pretty much where we are right now.</P
><P
>As a last note, the only systematic Linux video card benchmarking effort I'm aware of
			was done, unfortunately, in March 2001, between a Radeon 32 DDR and a GeForce 2.  You can read
			it for yourself at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxhardware.org/features/01/03/19/0357219.shtml"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.linuxhardware.org/features/01/03/19/0357219.shtml</A
>, but conclusion is
			that the GeForce 2 firmly and soundly trounced the Radeon 32 DDR.</P

>7.2. Current Status (1 March 2004)</H2
><P
>nVidia's latest offering is the GeForce 5900, based on the NV35 chipset.  It's well
			supported by Linux with high quality but proprietary drivers.  nVidia uses a convenient
			combined driver architecture; their driver will support the TNT 2 all the way up to the
			GeForce 5900.  Although their drivers are closed source, as a company, nVidia has been
			supportive and good to Linux users.</P
><P
>ATI's has worked with Linux developers for their Radeons up to and including the Radeon
			9200, which have 2D and 3D support in XFree86.  I'm not entirely sure of the quality of these
			open source drivers, however, Soldier of Fortune I and Heavy Metal still have opaque texture
			problems under first generation Radeons.  Beyond the 9200, you need to use ATI's binary only
			proprietary drivers, available in rpm format from ATI's website.  It's claimed that these
			drivers are piss poor; a friend of mine claims his GeForce 4400 outperforms his Radeon 9700
			pro.  That's shameful.</P
><P
>On paper, and in the Windows benchmarks, the Radeon 9800 trounces the ill-conceived
			GeForce 5800 and slightly edges out the GeForce 5900.  On paper, it's simply the more
			impressive card.  But again, the driver issue makes this information unusable for us.  If you
			have your heart set to buy the best card for Linux, you'll want to go with the GeForce
			5900.</P

><P
>Anti aliasing is the smoothing of jagged edges along a rendered curve or polygon.
				Pixels are rectangular objects, so drawing an angled line or curve with them results in a
				'stair step' effect, also called the 'jaggies'.  This is when pixels make, what should be a
				smooth curve or line, jagged.  AA uses CPU intensive filtering to smooth out these jagged
				edges.  This improves a game's visuals, but can also dramatically degrade
				performance.</P
><P
>AA is used in a number of situations.  For instance, when you magnify a picture,
				you'll notice lines that were once smooth become jagged (try it with The Gimp).  Font
				rendering is another big application for AA.</P
><P
>AA can be done either by the application itself (as with The Gimp or the XFree86 font
				system) or by hardware, if your video card supports it.  Since AA is CPU intensive, it's
				more desirable to perform it in hardware, but if we're talking about semi-static
				applications, like The Gimp, this really isn't an issue.  For dynamic situations, like
				games, doing AA in hardware can be crucial.</P

><P
>Mip mapping is a technique where several scaled copies of the same texture are stored
				in the video card memory to represent the texture at different distances.  When the texture
				is far away a smaller version of the texture (mip map) is used.  When the texture is near, a
				bigger one is used.  Mip mapping can be used regardless of filtering method (<A
HREF="x608.html#TEXTUREFILTERING"
>Section 7.4.6</A
>).  Mip mapping reduces memory bandwidth requirements since the
				images are in hardware, but it also offers better quality in the rendered image.</P

NAME="TEXTUREFILTERING"

>7.4.6. Texture Filtering</H3
><P
>Texture filtering is the fundamental feature required to present sweet 3D graphics.
				It's used for a number of purposes, like making adjacent textures blend smoothly and making
				textures viewed from an angle (think of looking at a billboard from an extreme angle) look
				realistic.  There are several common texture filtering techniques including point-sampling,
				bilinear, trilinear and anisotropic filtering.</P
><P
>When I talk about 'performance hits', keep in mind that the performance hit depends on
				what resolution you're running at.  For instance, at a low resolution you may get only a
				very slight hit by using trilinear filtering instead of bilinear filtering.  But at high
				resolutions, the performance hit may be enormous.  Also, I'm not aware of any card that uses
				anisotropic texture filtering.  TNT drivers claim they do, but I've read that these drivers
				still use trilinear filtering when actually rendering an image to the screen.</P

>Trilinear filtering is a high quality bilinear filter which uses the four closest
						pixels in the second most suitable mip map to produce smoother transitions between mip
						map levels.  Trilinear filtering samples eight pixels and interpolates them before
						rendering.  Trilinear filtering always uses mip mapping.  Trilinear filtering eliminates
						the banding effect that appears between adjacent mip map levels.  Most modern 3D
						accelerated video cards can do trilinear filtering in hardware with no performance

>Anisotropic filtering is the best but most CPU intensive of the three common
						texture filtering methods.  Trilinear filtering is capable of producing fine visuals,
						but it only samples from a square area which in some cases is not the ideal method.
						Anisotropic (meaning 'from any direction') samples from more than 8 pixels.  The number
						of sampled pixels and which sampled pixels it uses depends on the viewing angle of the
						surface relative to your screen.  It shines when viewing alphanumeric characters at an
						angle.</P

>7.4.7. Z Buffering</H3
><P
>A Z buffer is a portion of RAM which represents the distance between the viewer (you)
				and each pixel of an object.  Many modern 3D accelerated cards have a Z buffer in their
				video RAM, which speeds things up considerably, but Z buffering can also be done by the
				application's rendering engine.  However, this sort of thing clearly should be done in
				hardware wherever possible.</P
><P
>Every object has a stacking order, like a deck of cards.  When objects are rendered
				into a 2D frame buffer, the rendering engine removes hidden surfaces by using the Z buffer.
				There are two approaches to this.  Dumb engines draw far objects first and close objects
				last, obscuring objects below them in the Z buffer.  Smart engines calculate what portions
				of objects will be obscured by objects above them and simply not render the portions that
				you won't see anyhow.  For complicated textures this is a huge savings in processor
				work.</P
