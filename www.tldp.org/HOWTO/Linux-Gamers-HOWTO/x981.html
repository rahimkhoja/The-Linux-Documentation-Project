>As the company that brought CTP and Quake3 to Linux, Loki was the father
					of Linux gaming.  They were one of the first and had, by far, the most titles (I own ALL
					of them).  Loki ported games to Linux, mostly using the SDL library.  Loki's death in
					January 2002 was the biggest setback Linux has ever had in its attempt to capture the
					general desktop market.  Linuxgames.com has a nice Loki timeline at <A

>Tribsoft released Jagged Alliance 2, an excellent rpg/strat which claimed
					2+ weeks of my life.  There were slated to release Europai Universalis, Majesty and
					Unfinished Business.  However, as of 3Jan01, Mathieu Pinard of Tribsoft said that he was
					taking a break and Tribsoft would no longer release games for awhile.  He'll still support
					JA2 but don't expect patches or updates.</P

HREF="http://www.flatwaremedia.com/liberace/gallery.cfm"

>.  It's a comic
					book on your monitor.  They were slated to release Hopkins FBI II and a few other titles,
					but it's been a few years since the announcements with no sign that the games are coming.
					They've ignored all my attempts at finding out more information, so I have to conclude
					that MP Entertainment is in the same status as Tribsoft.  You can still purchase or
					download a demo of Hopkins FBI from their website.  If anyone has more information on this
					company or the author of Hopkins FBI, please contact me.</P

>Despite the astounding
				fact that the Linux Gamers' FAQ doesn't mention the Linux Gamers' HOWTO as a resource
				anywhere in their text, I regard the FAQ as a good companion to this HOWTO.  I've tried to
				keep game specific information in this HOWTO at a minimum.  The FAQ takes the opposite
				approach; they mainly focus on the games themselves, including game specific problems and
				where to get Linux games in the first place.  The FAQ and HOWTO are complementary in this
				regard, and I've tried to not reproduce their content.  Despite the authors being a bit
				surly, their effort with the FAQ is very good.  If you want a general source of information
				on game specific questions, the FAQ is a fantastic place to start with.  In addition, the
				FAQ keeps a fairly large database of Linux Games.</P
