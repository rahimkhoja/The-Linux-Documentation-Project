>8. Software Builds</H1
><P
>This section deals with the best practices for software builds.  Build
is the process of creating the application binaries for a software release.
They are done in a periodic manner by the build teams to provide baseline
binaries for daily work.  </P

>8.1. Build Early and Build Often (<SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BEBO</SPAN
>)</H2
><P
>A variation of this adage has been around in the Open Source
community called "Release Early and Release Often" for quite some time
albeit for a different reason.  BEBO helps a development team identify
issues that can arise from checking in the wrong files.  BEBO will address
integration issues at the application level that might have slipped passed
individual developer builds.  It will also improve the team morale when they
see a working version of the application.</P
><P
>Builds must be done on a regular basis.  There should be a dedicated
resource(s) assigned to do the same.  The entire project team must be
trained to view the daily build as an important activity and not as a chore.
Builds must be completed without any failures on a regular basis.  Build
failures must be a rare event and should be treated with utmost seriousness.
The project team should ensure that successful builds are top priority on
their agenda.  The seriousness can be emphasised by setting up a penalty for
breaking the build.  </P
><P
>Each build can be tagged in CVS using a standard naming convention.
This can help developers checkout a working version of the entire system
from daily builds for local development.  </P

>8.2. Automate build Process completely</H2
><P
>Another key practice for software builds is to automate the build
process completely.  The automation process must also include automatic
retrieval of the right source files from the CVS repository.  This
ensures that the build process is completely repeatable and consistent.  In
addition, the chances of a build with the wrong version of the application
source files are reduced to a large degree.  </P
><P
>By automating the build process, the task of building often becomes
less burdensome.  </P

>8.3. All necessary files must be checked-in  before build</H2
><P
>This adage sounds trivial at first but this problem is very common
even with experienced development teams due to oversight.  The problem of
oversight cannot be easily addressed since the onus is on the individual
developer to ensure that his or her file has been checked in.  This practice
should be drummed into the team in the form of training and pre-build
announcements to ensure that the right version of source code is available
in the repository.  </P
><P
>Automated build process as explained above will help in catching this
problem to a certain degree since they will automatically take the source
code from the CVS repository and perform the software build.  Any missed
items will surface during the build process itself (makefiles etc.,) or
during the regression testing of the product (older version of the file
checked in).  </P
><P
>A penalty based system can be setup to handle wrong check-in.  Having a
kitty for a post project party to which each person who makes a wrong check-in
will contribute a fixed amount will act a good penalty system.  </P
