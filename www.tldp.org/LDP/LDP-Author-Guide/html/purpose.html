>This document was started on Aug 26, 1999 by Mark
      F. Komarinski after two day's worth of frustration getting tools
      to work. If even one LDP author is helped by this, then I did my
      job.</P

>&#13;			Version 4 of this document was released in early 2004 by Emma Jane
			Hogbin. A complete overhaul of the document was done to separate
			the authoring HOWTOs from the technical HOWTOs. The review took
			approximately eight months.

>&#13;        The newest version of this document can be found at the LDP
        homepage

        The original DocBook, HTML, and other formats can be found there.

>&#13;		There are many ways to contribute to the Linux movement
      that do not require the ability to produce software. One such way is
		to write documentation. The availability of
		easy-to-understand, technically accurate documentation can make a
		world of difference to someone who is struggling with Linux
		software. This Guide is designed to help you research and write a 
		HOWTO which can be submitted to the LDP. The appendices also include
		sample templates, markup tips and information on how to transform
		your document from DocBook to another format (such as HTML) for
		easier proofreading.
