>3.2. Scope of Your Document</H1
><P
>&#13;	Now that you've got a subject, you will need to decide the
	<EM

	should be:
</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Clearly defined. </B
>
              Define the boundaries of your
              subject area before you begin. Do not repeat information that is in
				  another HOWTO and do not leave gaps of information between
				  your HOWTO and someone else's HOWTO.
            </P
></DIV
></LI
><LI
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Not too broad, and not too narrow. </B
>
                If you try to cover too much information you may sacrifice depth. 
				It is better to cover a small subject area in detail than to cover a large subject
                area poorly. Linux tools are known for doing exactly one
                thing and doing that one thing <EM
>well</EM
>. 
                Similarly, your HOWTO should cover one subject and cover it
                <EM
>well</EM
>.
              </P
></DIV
><P
>&#13;			 	If the scope of your proposed document is very narrow, it might be better to
				include your information as part of another HOWTO.
            This makes it easier for readers to find the HOWTO they need. 
				Search the LDP repository for topics which relate to your
				document. If you find a document which is a good match, email the author
				and ask them if they would like to include your contribution.
          </P

>Undocumented. </B
>
              Before documenting a particular subject, always do a web
				  search (and specifically a search within the LDP documents)
				  to see if your topic is already covered in another
				  document. If it is, refer to the other document instead of
				  duplicating the information within your own document. You
				  may wish to include a brief summary of information that
				  can be found in other documents. 
            </P
></DIV
><P
>&#13;            If the HOWTO already in place is insufficient or needs updating, 
            contact the author and offer to help.  See also <A
HREF="unmaintained.html"
>Section 3.3</A
> for taking over old or unmaintained documents.</P
><P
>&#13;	    Most authors appreciate any help offered.  Additionally, sending
		 comments and remarks to the author is usually regarded both as a
		 reassurance and a reward: to the author, feedback is the ultimate proof that writing the documentation was not a pointless effort.</P

              Before you proceed with your HOWTO, post to the discuss list
              and get some feedback from other LDP volunteers. Checking with the
              list <EM

		in another, larger HOWTO that already exists. If you're not sure
