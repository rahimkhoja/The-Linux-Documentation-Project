>&#13;	Editing tools have come a long way in their support for
	XML (and specifically DocBook). There are two types of
	editors outlined in this section: text editors (emacs,
	vim, etc); and word processors (OpenOffice, AbiWord,
	etc). New authors who are not comfortable working with
	markup languages should probably choose a word processor
	that can output DocBook files. For this reason the word
	processors are listed first. 
    </P

>&#13;        Although many editors can also validate your DocBook
	files, this information has been separated into <A

>&#13;	Even if you are not comfortable working DocBook's tagset
	in a text editor you can still produce valid DocBook
	documents using a word processor. Support at this point
	is very limited, but it does exist in the following
	programs. The up side, of course, is that things like
	spell check are built in to the program. In addition to
	this, support for DocBook (and XML) is constantly

>&#13;At first, if I opened an XML file that had even one parsing error, it
would just open the file anyway and display the markup in OO.  I have
many XML files that use &#38;copy; and other types of entities which show
up as parse errors (depending on the encoding) even though they can be
processed through.  But today I was unable to open any of those files.
I got input/output errors instead.  Still investigating that one.
	</P
><P
>&#13;However when you do successfully open a document (one parsing with no
errors), it puts it automatically into WYSIWYG based on the markup,
and you can then work from the paragraph styles menu like any other
such editor.

>&#13;To validate the document, I used <SPAN

>Tools</SPAN

clicked the <SPAN
CLASS="guibutton"
>Test XSLTs</SPAN

for export to be <TT
CLASS="filename"
>ldp-html.xsl</TT
>.	If you test and there are errors,
a new window pops up with error messages at the bottom, and the lines
that need to be changed up at the top.	You can change them there and
progress through the errors until they're all gone, and keep testing
until they're gone.
