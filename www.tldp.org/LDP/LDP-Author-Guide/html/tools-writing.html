>&#13;  	You may use any word processing or text editing tool to write your
	initial document. When you get to the markup stage you may want to use
	a text editor which recognizes DocBook files. At a minimum a program
	which adds syntax highlighting to your markup will make life a lot
	easier. For a description of editors which can handle DocBook files

> CVS can be combined with scripts to automatically

		Currently, CVS updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to
      update the LDP web page, meaning that if you use CVS, you're not
      required to e-mail your XML code. (Although you do
      still need to send the submit list an email when you
      are ready for your document to be published, because the whole publishing process has not been fully automated yet.) </P
