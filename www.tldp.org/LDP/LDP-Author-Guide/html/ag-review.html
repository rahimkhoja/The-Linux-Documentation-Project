>6.4. TLDP Review Process</H1
><P
>&#13;	Before your document is accepted to the LDP collection it will undergo
	at least three formal reviews. These reviews include a <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/techreview.html"
TARGET="_top"
>technical accuracy
	review</A
>, a <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/languagereview.html"
TARGET="_top"
>language
	review</A
> and a <A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/metadatareview.html"
TARGET="_top"
>metadata
	review</A
>. All new documents must pass these reviews
	before being accepted into the collection.
</P
><P
>&#13;	When you feel your document is finished, email a copy to the submit 
	mailing list (<TT
CLASS="email"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:submit@en.tldp.org"
>submit@en.tldp.org</A
>&#62;</TT
>). Please include the title of your document and
	<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Final Review Required"</SPAN
> in the subject line of your email. 
	A team of volunteers will be assigned to your document for each of the
	reviews. It may take up to a week to gather a team who is qualified to review your document.
	Typically the technical review happens first, followed by the language
	review and finally the metadata review. Your reviewers will read your document give you feedback on
	whether or not they think your document is ready for publication in the
	LDP collection.
</P
><P
>&#13;	Your reviewers may have specific points that must be changed. Once you
	have made the changes submit your document back to your review team.
	They will review the document again and advise you on whether or not
	your document is ready for inclusion in the LDP collection. You may
	need to undergo several edits before your document is ready. Or it may
	not require any additional work. Be prepared to make at least one round
	of changes for both the technical and language reviews. Ideally this
	exchange will happen in the LDP's <A
HREF="http://cvs.tldp.org"
TARGET="_top"
>CVS</A
> to better track each of the
	changes that are made, and keep track of the most current version of
	your document.
</P
><P
>&#13;	Once your document has passed both the technical and language reviews,
	you may submit it by following the instructions in <A
HREF="submission.html"
>Section 6.5</A
