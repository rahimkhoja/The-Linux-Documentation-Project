>3.4. Developing an Outline</H1
><P
>&#13;      Before you actually begin writing, prepare an outline.
      An outline will help you to get a clear picture of the subject matter
      and allow you to concentrate on one small part of the HOWTO
      at a time.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Unless your HOWTO is exceptionally small, your outline will probably
      be multilevel.
      When developing a multilevel outline, the top level should contain general
      subject areas, and sub-headings should be more detailed and specific.
      Look at each level of your outline independently,
      and make sure it covers all key areas of the subject matter. Sub-headings
      should cover all key areas of the heading under which they fall.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Each item in your outline should follow the item before it,
      and lead into the item that comes next. For example, a HOWTO about a particular
      program shouldn't have a section on <EM
>configuration</EM
>
      before one on <EM
>installation</EM
>.</P
><P
>You may choose to use the following outline for a HOWTO about
	  using a specific program:</P

>You may find it helpful to try a little <SPAN

> at this stage of the writing process. Write all of your mini
	subject areas onto pieces of paper. Now sort these pieces of paper into
	main headings and their sub-sections. It may help to shuffle the slips of
	paper before you start. This will help to give you a fresh set of eyes
	while working.
	</P
><P
>&#13;      When you are comfortable with your outline, look it over once more,
      with a critical eye. Have you covered every relevant topic in
      sufficient detail? Have you not wandered beyond the scope of the document?
      It is a good idea to show your outline to others (including The LDP
	  discuss list) to get some feedback.
      Remember: it is much easier to reorganize your document at the outline stage 
	  than doing this after writing it.
