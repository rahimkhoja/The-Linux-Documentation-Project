>Another effective way to communicate to a targeted audience
  is through an email campaign. The effectiveness of a good email
  should not be underestimated. Some fundraising experts, for
  example, can raise thousand of dollars with an effective email
  campaign. Exceptional letters have obtained contracts, sold
  properties, and landed jobs.</P
><P
>Emails can be targeted to a specific audience for much less
  than you would spend on a regular mail campaign. Every email is
  an opportunity to effectively communicate to your target
  audience. For example, your organization might want to target
  recent graduates of local computer training courses with
  opportunities in their area. You will need to obtain the names
  and email addresses of recent graduates from the institutions
  offering those programs. Cooperation with their institution can
  often be established if you provide something in return, such as
  a reciprocal link on your website, a mention in your newsletter,
  or even free advertising.</P
><P
>Hopefully, your email campaign will generate interest in
  your organization and your programs. Be mindful of potentially
  spamming your intended audience&#8212;this could
  have a negative impact.</P
