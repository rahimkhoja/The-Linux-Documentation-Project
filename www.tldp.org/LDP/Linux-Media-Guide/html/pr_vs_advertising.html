>1.3. How Public Relations Differs from Advertising</H1
><P
>International humorist Stephen Leacock defined advertising
  as: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the science of arresting the human
  intelligence long enough to get money from it."</SPAN
> But
  the textbook definition of advertising is: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"a
  form of persuasion that informs people about the goods and
  services they can purchase."</SPAN
></P
><P
>Advertising is very different from public relations. One
  key difference is that you always pay for the space and time of
  an advertisement (or commercial, which is an insert appearing on
  radio, television, or the Internet). By contrast, editorial
  coverage generated through public relations is not paid for by
  the organization issuing the news release. The media will pick up
  and publish the story because they consider it newsworthy, not as
  a paid advertisement.</P
><P
>Another crucial difference is that, in advertising, you
  have virtually full control over the message. Because you are
  paying for advertising, the ad or commercial runs your exact text
  (called copy), provided the copy complies with generally
  acceptable standards for advertising. In the case of public
  relations, the media outlet you are targeting is under no
  obligation to run the story in any form. If a media outlet does
  decide to run the story, an editor will generally rewrite the
  news release, or use pertinent information from the news release
  to create the news. (For instance, your news release might be
  used as part of a larger story on players in your industry or
  profession.) In addition, you have no control over when the
  release or news will run. All decisions are made by the
  editor.</P
><P
>As you can see, public relations is a cost-effective way of
  getting your story out. Taking the trouble to write effective
  news releases and to build a relationship with the relevant media
  will, in time, pay dividends in the form of exposure and
  prestige. Best of all, public relations probably costs less than
  a single advertisement.</P
