>3.3.1. Letter of Introduction</H2
><P
>When contacting an editor for the first time, you should
  take pains to get your relationship off to a good start. This is
  best accomplished by sending a well-crafted letter (or email) of
  introduction prior to issuing your first news release.</P
><P
>Even if you have been involved in media relations in
  another capacity, a letter of introduction can help establish a
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"new era"</SPAN
> of cooperation between
  you (in your new public relations role) and the editor. After
  all, a successful public and media relations program is all about
  relationships&#8212;successful ones.</P
><P
>What must your letter accomplish? Consider your goals
  carefully, because this letter can do a great deal for your
  organization.</P
><P
>First, reaching the right editor or reporter is extremely
  important. Then, you will want to get that editor's help in identifying other
  professionals who may be interested in receiving and conveying
  Linux news. These professionals include freelance writers (who
  write speculatively or on assignment, then sell specific stories
  to publications), editors in related areas (business and feature
  editors), industry spokespeople, and so on. Your letter also
  needs to articulate why this editor will likely be interested in
  your organization's story and why his or her
  audience will be interested.</P
><P
>The primary purpose for the letter of introduction is to
  open the lines of communication and to make yourself or your
  designated spokesperson available. Be sure to give your full name
  and contact information. 
  <EM
>Most importantly, do not forget to include
  your email and website addresses.</EM
>
  Email is the preferred method of communication in the
  journalistic community. Make corresponding and dealing with you
  easy for your media contacts. This is critical to the success of
  any media and public relations program.</P
><P
>If you include broadcast in your public relations program,
  you will need to adjust the terminology accordingly. Instead of
  editors, you will be corresponding with news directors and
  producers; instead of readers, you will be referring to
  listeners, viewers, or an audience. No matter what their job
  description is, remember that you are dealing with actual people.
  The more personable you are in your correspondence, the more
  likely you are to see results.</P

>3.3.2. Using the Phone</H2
><P
>Regardless of the size and scope of your media relations
  program, look for an opportunity to directly contact at least
  some of the editors and journalists important to your
  organization. The telephone is a tremendous ally in any public
  relations program. A phone call establishes person-to-person
  contact, lends credibility to your public relations effort, and
  helps your contact to associate a name to the news releases you
  subsequently send to them. A few moments on the phone, either as
  a prelude or a follow-up to a news release, not only draws
  attention to your organization but can also impart a sense of
  immediacy and urgency that may provide the edge you need to
  acquire editorial coverage of your story.</P
><P
>When calling an editor, always immediately identify
  yourself and your organization. Next, ask if the editor is on
  deadline. If their answer is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Yes,"</SPAN
>
  don't tie up their time but offer to call back
  in a day or two and then do so. Editors are known for their
  extraordinary memory&#8212;they never forget a
  nuisance or a courtesy.</P
><P
>If the editor is not on deadline, then state immediately
  why you are calling, saying something like this:</P
><A
NAME="AEN256"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Hello, I'm (name) with (my organization), and I'm 
  calling to alert you to our announcement of (news topic). I want you to know
  that I'm available to you for any additional information or an interview, 
  now or any time in the future. Give me a call at (phone number) or email 
  me at (email address)."</SPAN
></P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>Look what the dialogue above accomplishes. You have
  identified yourself and your organization, stated your business
  succinctly, and offered your services as a liaison. Now let the
  editor decide what to do. If they seem to want to get off the
  phone quickly, don't worry. They may have
  something urgent demanding their attention or a story that needs
  to be filed immediately. You can always call back or have the
  editor return your call later. Listen carefully to the
  editor's recommendations for calling them at
  another time.</P
><P
>While most editors and reporters are busy, they are seldom
  rude (in fact, the contrary) and usually cooperative. If the
  editor asks why you are calling, or has other questions, be
  prepared to answer. As in any business situation, always do your
  homework. If necessary, write down potential questions and
  answers and rehearse beforehand. Nothing irritates a busy editor
  or reporter more than dealing with a public relations
  representative who is unprepared to answer basic
  questions.</P
><P
>If you cannot answer all the questions, promise to find the
  answers and send the information by email. 
  <EM
>Be sure to do this in a timely fashion.</EM
>
  Editors appreciate quick responses and will give more attention
  to people who can give them the information they are seeking in a
  timely manner. This is a very important consideration.</P
><P
>If the editor gives you a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"No thanks, not
  interested"</SPAN
> response&#8212;which may
  happen quite frequently at the beginning&#8212;you
  should ask if there is someone else on staff who would be
  interested in your information. If there is time, and the editor
  seems receptive to sharing information (listen carefully to their
  tone of voice and phone manner), you might also ask if there is
  anything special about Linux they are looking for, now or in the
  future. After all, the less you waste of each
  other's time, the more productive your
  relationship will be.</P
><P
>Once editors know of you and your organization, there may
  be times when they contact you directly. For example, the
  publications you have targeted may occasionally feature an
  editorial focus on Linux. Check the editorial calendars of these
  publications on a regular basis. Periodicals plan their issues
  two to three months in advance of the publication date, so you
  need to be proactive in pitching (telling) your
  organization's story ahead of time. Editorial
  calendars are often made available on the
  publication's website. They are also usually
  available free of charge from the
  publication's advertising department. If all
  else fails, contacting the publication's
  editorial assistant and making a polite request should yield
  positive results.</P
><P
>Another important way to use the phone is to find out who
  you should be contacting at a specific publication. The
  receptionist is usually cooperative and very knowledgeable about
  this. You may end up talking to a lot of different people before
  you get the answers you need, but public relations is far more
  effective when you deliver your news to the right people.</P
