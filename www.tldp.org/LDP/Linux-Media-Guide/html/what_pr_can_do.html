>1.4. What Public Relations Can Do</H1
><P
>Since public relations communicates your messages through
  the news media, all the power of the media is brought to bear
  when the public&#8212;those viewers, listeners, or
  readers you want to reach&#8212;learns about your
  news.</P
><P
>Think of what this means: high interest level, credibility,
  implied objectivity, and possibly implied endorsement by the
  journalist or publication reporting the information. There is
  also an urgency conveyed when news is reported in the
  media&#8212;and that news has the potential to reach
  a tremendously large audience.</P
><P
>With exposure comes awareness. An important goal of public
  relations&#8212;in any medium&#8212;is to make people aware of what 
  your organization is, what it offers, and what it does. Never
  underestimate the value of such awareness. In flashier terms, 
  it's called <EM
>buzz.</EM
></P
><P
>Creating awareness for your organization is important for
  the development and utilization of its programs and initiatives.
  You must inform the public and educational and training
  institutions about what you offer and how you can meet their
  needs. Public relations is probably the most valuable tool in
  accomplishing this. A well-implemented public relations
  initiative will help present your organization's offerings to their best
  advantage.</P
><P
>Public and news media relations also positions you to enter
  new marketplaces and exposes new Linux programs to new
  audiences&#8212;all without the expense associated
  with an advertising program. A sustained public relations program
  allows you to ensure your programs are in front of appropriate
  decision-makers. This continuous flow of information creates a
  constant awareness and a constant influx of
  inquiries&#8212;especially when integrated with
  other powerful marketing communications tools such as brochures,
  trade shows, and so on.</P
