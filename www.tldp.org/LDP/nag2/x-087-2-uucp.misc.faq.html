>&#13;This section describes what may go wrong with your UUCP connection and makes
location suggestions to fix the error. Although these problems are 
encountered on a regular basis, there is much more that can go wrong
than what we have listed.</P
><P
>&#13;If you have a problem, enable debugging with <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;xall</TT
>,
and take a look at the output in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Debug</TT
> in the spool
directory. The file should help you to quickly recognize the problem. It is 
often helpful to turn on the modem's speaker when it doesn't 
connect. With Hayes-compatible modems, you can turn on the speaker by adding
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ATL1M1 OK</TT
> to the modem chat in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dial</TT
> file.</P
><P
>The first check should always be whether all file permissions are set
correctly. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> should be setuid <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
>, and all files in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/uucp</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucp</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucppublic</TT
> should be owned by
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
>. There are also some
hidden files in the spool directory which must be owned by <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
> as well.<A

didn't specify a <B

details when the remote system may be called, or you gave one that actually

CLASS="COMMAND"

> detects a lock file for the remote
system in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucp</TT
>. The lock file may be from an
earlier call to the system that crashed or was killed. Another possible
explanation is that there's another <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B

sitting around that is trying to dial the remote system and has gotten stuck
in a chat script, or stalled for some other reason.</P
><P
>To correct this error, kill all <B

open for the site with a hangup signal, and remove all lock files that
they have left lying around.</P

></H2
><P
>Look at the text you receive from the remote site. If it's garbled, you might
have a speed-related problem. Otherwise, confirm that it really agrees with what
your chat script expects.  Remember, the chat script starts with an expect
string. If you receive the login prompt and send your name, but never get the
password prompt, insert some delays before sending it, or even in between the
letters. You might be too fast for your modem.</P

>If your modem doesn't indicate that the DTR line has been raised when
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> calls out, you might not have given the
right device to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
>. If your modem recognizes
DTR, check with a terminal program that you can write to the modem. If
this works, turn on echoing with <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>\E</SPAN
> at the start of the modem chat. If the
modem doesn't echo your commands during the modem chat, check if your
line speed is too high or low. If you see the echo, check if you have
disabled modem responses or set them to number codes.  Verify that the
chat script itself is correct. Remember that you have to write two
backslashes to send one to the modem.</P

>Insert a delay into the phone number, especially if you have to dial a
special sequence to gain an outside line from a corporate telephone network.
Make sure you are using the correct dial type, as some telephone networks
support only one type of dialing. Additionally, double check the telephone
number to make sure it's correct.</P

></H2
><P
>Well, there can be a number of problems in this situation. The output in the 
log file should tell you a lot. Look at what protocols the remote site 
offers (it sends a string <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>P</TT
>
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>protlist</I
></TT
> during the handshake). For the handshake 
to succeed, both ends must support at least one common protocol, so check 
that they do.</P
><P
>If the remote system sends <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>RLCK</B
>, there is a stale lockfile
for you on the remote system already connected to the remote system on a 
different line.  Otherwise, ask the remote system administrator to remove the 
file.</P
><P
>If the remote system sends <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>RBADSEQ</B

count checks enabled for you, but the numbers didn't match. If it sends
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>RLOGIN</B
