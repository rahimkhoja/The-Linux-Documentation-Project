Articles can be fed to C News in several ways. When a local user posts
an article, the newsreader usually hands it to the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inews</B
> command, which completes the header
information. News from remote sites, be it a single article or a whole
batch, is given to the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
> command, which stores
it in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/news/in.coming</TT
> directory,
from where it will be picked up at a later time by
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>newsrun</B
>. With any of these two techniques, however,
the article will eventually be handed to the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> command.</P
><P
>&#13;





For each article, the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> command first checks if the
article has already been seen at the local site by looking up the message ID
in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file. Duplicate articles are dropped.
Then <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> looks at the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Newsgroups:</TT
>
header line to find out if the local site requests articles from any of these
groups.  If it does, and the newsgroup is listed in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>active</TT
> file, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> tries to store
the article in the corresponding directory in the news spool area. If this
directory does not exist, it is created. The article's message ID is then 
logged to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file.  Otherwise,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> drops the article.</P
><P
>&#13;Sometimes <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> fails to store an incoming
article because a group to which it has been posted is not listed in
your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>active</TT
> file. In this case, the article is moved to the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>junk</SPAN
>
group.<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNCN01"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNCN01"
>[1]</A
>
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>relaynews</B
> also checks for stale or misdated articles
and reject them. Incoming batches that fail for any other reason are moved
to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/news/in.coming/bad</TT
>, and an error message
is logged.</P
><P
>After this, the article is relayed to all other sites that request news
from these groups, using the transport specified for each particular site. To
make sure an article isn't sent to a site that has already seen it, each
destination site is checked against the article's <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Path:</TT
>
header field, which contains the list of sites the article has traversed so
far, written in the UUCP-style bang-path source-routing style described in
<A
HREF="x-087-2-mail.html"
>Chapter 17</A
>. If the destination site's name does not
appear in this list, the article is sent to it.</P
><P
>&#13;
C News is commonly used to relay news between UUCP sites, although it is
also possible to use it in an NNTP environment. To deliver news to a remote
UUCP site, either in single articles or whole batches, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uux</B
>
is used to execute the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
> command on the remote site and
feed the article or batch to it on standard input.
Refer to <A
HREF="x-087-2-uucp.html"
>Chapter 16</A
>, for more information on UUCP.</P
><P
>&#13;
Batching is the term used to describe sending large bundles of
individual articles all in one transmission. When batching is
enabled for a given site, C News does not send any incoming article
immediately; instead, it appends its path name to a file, usually called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>out.going/site/togo</TT
>. Periodically, a program is executed
from a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>crontab</B
> entry by the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron</B
> program,
which reads this file and bundles all of the listed articles into one or more
file, optionally compressing them and sending them to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
>
at the remote site.<A
