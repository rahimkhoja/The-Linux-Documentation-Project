>This edition of the Networking Guide owes almost everything to the
outstanding work of Olaf and Vince. It is difficult to appreciate the
effort that goes into researching and writing a book of this nature
until you've had a chance to work on one yourself. Updating the book
was a challenging task, but with an excellent base to work from, it
was an enjoyable one.</P
><P
>This book owes very much to the numerous people who took the time to
proof-read it and help iron out many mistakes, both technical and
grammatical (never knew that there was such a thing as a dangling
participle). Phil Hughes, John Macdonald, and Erik Ratcliffe all
provided very helpful (and on the whole, quite consistent) feedback on
the content of the book.</P
><P
>We also owe many thanks to the people at O'Reilly we've had the
pleasure to work with: Sarah Jane Shangraw, who got the book into the
shape you can see now; Maureen Dempsey, who copyedited the text; Rob
Romano, Rhon Porter, and Chris Reilley, who created all the figures;
Hanna Dyer, who designed the cover; Alicia Cech, David Futato, and
Jennifer Niedherst for the internal layout; Lars Kaufman for
suggesting old woodcuts as a visual theme; Judy Hoer for the index;
and finally, Tim O'Reilly for the courage to take up such a project.</P
><P
>We are greatly indebted to Andres Sepúlveda, Wolfgang Michaelis,
Michael K. Johnson, and all developers who spared the time to check
the information provided in the Networking Guide. Phil Hughes, John 
MacDonald, and Eric Ratcliffe contributed invaluable comments on the 
second edition. We also wish to thank all those who read the first version 
of the Networking Guide and sent corrections and suggestions. You can find 
a hopefully complete list of contributors in the file

> in the online distribution. Finally, this book 
would not have been possible without the support of Holger Grothe, who 
provided Olaf with the Internet connectivity he needed to make the original 
version happen.</P
><P
>Olaf would also like to thank the following groups and companies that 
printed the first edition of the Networking Guide and have donated
money either to him or to the Linux Documentation Project as a whole:
Linux Support Team, Erlangen, Germany; S.u.S.E. GmbH, Fuerth, Germany;
and Linux System Labs, Inc., Clinton Twp., United States, RedHat
Software, North Carolina, United States.</P
><P
>Terry thanks his wife, Maggie, who patiently supported him throughout
his participation in the project despite the challenges presented by
the birth of their first child, Jack. Additionally, he thanks the
<I

>many</I
> people of the Linux community who either
nurtured or suffered him to the point at which he could actually take
part and actively contribute. &#8220;I'll help you if you promise to
help someone else in return.&#8221;</P
