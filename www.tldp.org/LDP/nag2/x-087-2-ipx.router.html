></H1
><P
>You will recall from our short discussion of the protocols used in an
IPX environment that IPX is a routable protocol and that the Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) is used to propagate routing
information. The IPX version of RIP is quite similar to the IP
version. They operate in essentially the same way; routers
periodically broadcast the contents of their routing tables and other
routers learn of them by listening and integrating the information
they receive. Hosts need only know who their local network is and be
sure to send datagrams for all other destinations via their local
router. The router is responsible for carrying these datagrams and
forwarding them on to the next hop in the route.</P
><P
>&#13;
In an IPX environment, a second class of information must be
propagated around the network. The Service Advertisement Protocol
(SAP) carries information relating to which services are available at
which hosts around the network. It is the SAP protocol, for example,
that allows users to obtain lists of file or print servers on the
network. The SAP protocol works by having hosts that provide services
periodically broadcast the list of services they offer. The IPX
network routers collect this information and propagate it throughout
the network alongside the network routing information.  To be a
compliant IPX router, you must propagate both RIP and SAP information.</P
><P
>&#13;Just like IP, IPX on Linux provides a routing daemon named
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> to perform the tasks associated with managing
routing. Again, just as with IP, it is actually the kernel that
manages the forwarding of datagrams between IPX network interfaces,
but it performs this according to a set of rules called the IPX
routing table.  The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> daemon keeps that set of
rules up to date by listening on each of the active network interfaces
and analyzing when a routing change is necessary. The
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> daemon also answers requests from hosts on a
directly connected network that ask for routing information.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> command is available prepackaged in some
distributions, and in source form by anonymous FTP from 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>http://metalab.unc.edu/</I
> in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/ncpfs/ipxripd-x.xx.tgz</TT
>
file.</P
><P
>No configuration is necessary for the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> daemon.
When it starts, it automatically manages routing among the IPX
devices that have been configured. The key is to ensure that you have
your IPX devices configured correctly using the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipx_interface</B
> command before you start
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
>. While auto-detection may work, when you're
performing a routing function it's best not to take chances, so
manually configure the interfaces and save yourself the pain of nasty
routing problems. Every 30 seconds, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
>
rediscovers all of the locally attached IPX networks and automatically
manages them. This provides a means of managing networks on interfaces
that may not be active all of the time, such as PPP interfaces.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> would normally be started at boot time from
an <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rc</TT
> boot script like this:

No <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#38;</TT
> character is necessary because <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> will
move itself into the background by default. While the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> daemon is most useful on machines acting as
IPX routers, it is also useful to hosts on segments where there are
multiple routers present. When you specify the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#8211;p</TT
> argument, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipxd</B
> will act
passively, listening to routing information from the segment and
updating the routing tables, but it will not transmit any routing
information. This way, a host can keep its routing tables up to date
without having to request routes each time it wants to contact a
remote host.</P

>&#13;There are occasions when we might want to hardcode an IPX
route. Just as with IP, we can do this with IPX. The
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipx_route</B

routing table without it needing to have been learned by the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

simple (since IPX does not support subnetworking) and looks like:

The command shown would add a route to the remote IPX network

the <B

<TT

headers and look for traffic from the router. If the router is a Linux

need at least one other interface.</P

><P
>&#13;IPX hosts with more than one IPX interface have a unique network/node
address combination for each of their interfaces. To connect to such a
host, you may use any of these network/node address combinations. When
SAP advertizes services, it supplies the network/node address
associated with the service that is offered. On hosts with multiple
interfaces, this means that one of the interfaces must be chosen as the
one to propagate; this is the function of the primary interface flag
we talked about earlier. But this presents a problem: the route to
this interface may not always be the optimal one, and if a network
failure occurs that isolates that network from the rest of the
network, the host will become unreachable even though there are other
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>possible</I
> routes to the other interfaces.  The
other routes are never known to other hosts because they are never
propagated, and the kernel has no way of knowing that it should choose
another primary interface. To avoid this problem, a device was
developed that allows an IPX host to be known by a single
route-independent network/node address for the purposes of SAP
propagation. This solves our problem because this new network/node
address is reachable via all of the host interfaces, and is the one
that is advertised by SAP.</P
><P
>To illustrate the problem and its solution, <A
HREF="x-087-2-ipx.router.html#X-087-2-IPX.INTERNAL.NETWORK"
>Figure 15-1</A
> shows a server attached to two
IPX networks. The first network has no internal network, but the second
does. The host in diagram <A
HREF="x-087-2-ipx.router.html#X-087-2-IPX.INTERNAL.NETWORK"
>Figure 15-1</A
> would 
choose one of its interfaces as its primary interface, let's assume
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>0000001a:0800000010aa</I
>, and that is what 
would be advertised as its service access point. This works well for hosts
on the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>0000001a</I
> network, but means that 
users on the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>0000002c</I
> network will route via 
the network to reach that port, despite the server having a port directly on 
that network if they've discovered this server from the SAP broadcasts.</P

>Allowing such hosts to have a virtual network with virtual host
addresses that are entirely a software construct solves this
problem. This virtual network is best thought of as being
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>inside</I
> the IPX host. The SAP information then
needs only to be propagated for this virtual network/node address
combination. This virtual network is known as an <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>internal
network</I
>. But how do other hosts know how to reach this
internal network? Remote hosts route to the internal network via
the directly connected networks of the host. This means that you 
see routing entries that refer to the internal network of hosts
supporting multiple IPX interfaces. Those routes should choose the
optimal route available at the time, and should one fail, the routing is 
automatically updated to the next best interface and route. In
<A
HREF="x-087-2-ipx.router.html#X-087-2-IPX.INTERNAL.NETWORK"
>Figure 15-1</A
>, we've configured an
internal IPX network of address <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>0x10000010</I
> 
and used a host address of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>00:00:00:00:00:01</I
>. It is this address that will be our primary interface and will be advertised via SAP. Our routing will reflect this network as being reachable via
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>either</I
> of our real network ports, so hosts will
always use the best network route to connect to our server.</P
><P
>To create this internal network, use the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipx_internal_net</B
> command included in Greg Page's
IPX tools package. Again, a simple example demonstrates its use:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
># <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>ipx_internal_net add 10000010 000000000001</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

This command would create an IPX internal network with address
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>10000010</I
> and a node address of
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>000000000001</I
>. The network address, just like any other
IPX network address, must be unique on your network. The node address is
completely arbitrary, as there will normally be only one node on the network.
Each host may have only one IPX Internal Network, and if configured, the
Internal Network will always be the primary network.</P
