>&#13;
To build a Linux IP firewall, it is necessary to have a kernel built
with IP firewall support and the appropriate configuration utility. In
all production kernels prior to the 2.2 series, you would use the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> utility. The 2.2.x kernels marked the
release of the third generation of IP firewall for Linux called
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>IP Chains</I
>.  IP chains use a program similar to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
>. Linux
kernels 2.3.15 and later support the fourth generation of Linux IP
firewall called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
>. The
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> code is the result of a large redesign
of the packet handling flow in Linux. The
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> is a multifaceted creature, providing
direct backward-compatible support for both <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
>
and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> as well as a new alternative command
called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>iptables</B
>. We'll talk about the differences
between the three in the next few sections.</P

></H2
><P
>&#13;The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> (IP Firewall Administration) utility is the
tool used to build the firewall rules for all kernels prior to 2.2.0. Its
command syntax can be very confusing because it can do such a complicated
range of things, but we'll provide some common examples that will illustrate
the most important variations of these.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> utility is included in most
modern Linux distributions, but perhaps not by default. There may be a
specific software package for it that you have to install. If your
distribution does not include it, you can obtain the source package from
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ftp.xos.nl</SPAN
> in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pub/linux/ipfwadm/</TT
> directory, and compile it yourself.</P

>&#13;Just as for the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

It provides all of the flexibility of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> with a
simplified command syntax, and additionally provides a &#8220;chaining&#8221; mechanism that allows you to manage multiple
rulesets and link them together. We'll cover rule chaining in a separate
section near the end of the chapter, because for most situations it is an
advanced concept.</P
><P
>&#13;The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> command appears in most Linux
distributions based on the 2.2 kernels. If you want to compile it
yourself, you can find the source package from its developer's site at
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>http://www.rustcorp.com/linux/ipchains/</I
>.
Included in the source package is a wrapper script called
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm-wrapper</B
> that mimics the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> command, but actually invokes the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> command. Migration of an existing firewall
configuration is much more painless with this addition.</P

>&#13;The syntax of the <B

of the <B

result of the tool being redesigned to be extensible through shared libraries.
Just as for <B
