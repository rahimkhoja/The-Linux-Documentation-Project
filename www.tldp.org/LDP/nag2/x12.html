><P
>This book was written to provide a single reference for network
administration in a Linux environment. Beginners and experienced users
alike should find the information they need to cover nearly all
important administration activities required to manage a Linux network
configuration. The possible range of topics to cover is nearly
limitless, so of course it has been impossible to include everything
there is to say on all subjects. We've tried to cover the most
important and common ones. We've found that beginners to Linux
networking, even those with no prior exposure to Unix-like operating
systems, have found this book good enough to help them successfully
get their Linux network configurations up and running and get them
ready to learn more.</P
><P
>There are many books and other sources of information from which you
can learn any of the topics covered in this book (with the possible
exception of some of the truly Linux-specific features, such as the
new Linux firewall interface, which is not well documented elsewhere)
in greater depth. We've provided a bibliography for you to use when
you are ready to explore more.</P
