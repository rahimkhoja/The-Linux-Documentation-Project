>3.1. Kernel Configuration</A
></H1
><P
>Most Linux distributions are supplied with boot disks that work for
all common types of PC hardware. Generally, the supplied kernel is
highly modularized and includes nearly every possible driver. This is
a great idea for boot disks, but is probably not what you'd want for
long-term use. There isn't much point in having drivers cluttering up
your disk that you will never use. Therefore, you will generally roll
your own kernel and include only those drivers you actually need or
want; that way you save a little disk space and reduce the time it
takes to compile a new kernel.</P
><P
>In any case, when running a Linux system, you should be familiar with 
building a kernel. Think of it as a right of passage, an affirmation of 
the one thing that makes free software as powerful as it is&#8212;you have 
the source. It isn't a case of, &#8220;I have to compile a kernel,&#8221; 
rather it's a case of, &#8220;I <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>can</I
> compile a 
kernel.&#8221; The basics of compiling a Linux kernel are explained in Matt 
Welsh's book, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Running Linux</I
> (O'Reilly). Therefore, we 
will discuss only configuration options that affect networking in this 
section.</P
><P
>&#13; One important point that does bear
repeating here is the way the kernel version numbering scheme
works. Linux kernels are numbered in the following format:
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.2.14</TT
>. The first digit indicates the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>major</I
> version number. This digit changes when
there are large and significant changes to the kernel design. For
example, the kernel changed from major 1 to 2 when the kernel obtained
support for machines other than Intel machines. The second number is
the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>minor</I
> version number. In many respects, this
number is the most important number to look at. The Linux development
community has adopted a standard at which <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>even</I
> minor
version numbers indicate <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>production</I
>, or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>stable</I
>, kernels and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>odd</I
>
minor version numbers indicate <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>development</I
>, or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>unstable</I
>, kernels. The stable kernels are what
you should use on a machine that is important to you, as they have
been more thoroughly tested. The development kernels are what you
should use if you are interested in experimenting with the newest
features of Linux, but they may have problems that haven't yet been
found and fixed. The third number is simply incremented for each
release of a minor version.<A

>&#13;After the general option section is complete, the configuration will
go on to ask whether you want to include support for various features,
such as SCSI drivers or sound cards. The prompt will indicate what
options are available. You can press <TT

have the option of yes (<TT

>The subsequent list of questions deal with networking support. 
The exact set of configuration options is in constant flux due to ongoing 
development. A typical list of options offered by most kernel versions 
around 2.0 and 2.1 looks like this:

>&#13;
These questions concern the various link layer protocols that Linux
supports.  Both PPP and SLIP allow you to transport IP datagrams
across serial lines.  PPP is actually a suite of protocols used to
send network traffic across serial lines. Some of the protocols that
form PPP manage the way that you authenticate yourself to the dial-in
server, while others manage the way certain protocols are carried
across the link&#8212;PPP is not limited to carrying TCP/IP datagrams;
it may also carry other protocol such as IPX.</P
><P
>If you answer <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>y</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>m</TT
> to SLIP 
support, you will be prompted to answer the three questions that appear 
below it. The compressed header option provides support for CSLIP, a 
technique that compresses TCP/IP headers to as little as three bytes. Note 
that this kernel option does not turn on CSLIP automatically; it merely 
provides the necessary kernel functions for it. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Keepalive and 
linefill</TT
> option causes the SLIP support to periodically generate 
activity on the SLIP line to avoid it being dropped by an inactivity timer. The
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Six bit SLIP encapsulation</TT
> option allows you to run
SLIP over lines and circuits that are not capable of transmitting the
whole 8-bit data set cleanly. This is similar to the uuencoding or binhex 
technique used to send binary files by electronic mail.</P
><P
>PLIP provides a way to send IP datagrams across a parallel port connection.
It is mostly used to communicate with PCs running DOS. On typical PC hardware,
PLIP can be faster than PPP or SLIP, but it requires much more CPU overhead to
perform, so while the transfer rate might be good, other tasks on the machine
may be slow. </P
><P
>The following questions address network cards from various vendors.
As more drivers are being developed, you are likely to see questions added
to this section.  If you want to build a kernel you can use on a number of
different machines, or if your machine has more than one type of network
card installed, you can enable more than one driver:</P

features were made a standard part of the Kernel, such as support
for IPX.  A number of options were also added and made
configurable. Many of these options are used only in very special
circumstances and we won't cover them in detail. The Networking HOWTO
probably addresses what is not covered here. We'll list a number of
useful options in this section, and explain when you'd want to use

When sending data over TCP, the kernel has to break up the stream into blocks
of data to pass to IP. The size of the block is called the <I

>Maximum 
Transmission Unit</I
>, or MTU. For hosts that can be reached over a 
local network such as an
Ethernet, it is typical to use an MTU as large as the maximum length of an
Ethernet packet&#8212;1,500 bytes. When routing IP over a Wide Area Network 
like the Internet, it is preferable to use smaller-sized datagrams to ensure 
that they don't need to be further broken down along the route through a 
process called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

The IP protocol supports a feature called <I

>Source
Routing</I

datagram should follow by coding the route into the datagram
itself. This was once probably useful before routing protocols such as
RIP and OSPF became commonplace. But today it's considered a security
threat because it can provide clever attackers with a way of
circumventing certain types of firewall protection by bypassing the
routing table of a router. You would normally want to filter out
source routed datagrams, so this option is normally enabled:</P
