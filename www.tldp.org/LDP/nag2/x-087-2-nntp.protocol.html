generated by the receiving NNTP server is in the &#8220;3xx&#8221;

including it's full header, terminating the article with a period on a
line by itself. If the response code was in the &#8220;4xx&#8221;

possibly because it already has it, or because of some problem, such
as running out of disk space.</P

to reader mode, unless the IP address of the connecting host is listed

more about these numbers in a moment. The last field in the output displays flags

></H2
><P
>&#13;


We mentioned there was a difference between pushing an article and posting
an article. When you are pushing an article, there is an implicit assumption 
that the article already exists, that it has a message identifier that has 
been uniquely assigned to it by the server to which it was originally posted, 
and that it has a complete set of headers. When posting an article, you are 
creating the article for the first time and the only headers you supply are 
those that are meaningful to you, such as the Subject and the Newgroups to 
which you are posting the article. The news server you post the article on 
will add all the other headers for you and create a message ID that it will 
use when pushing the article onto other servers.</P
><P
>All of this means that posting an article is even easier than pushing one.
An example posting looks like this:</P

When a newsreader first connects to a new server and the user chooses a
newsgroup to browse, the newsreader will want to retrieve a list of new
articles, those posted or received since the last login by the user. The
<TT

purpose. Three mandatory arguments must be supplied: the name of
the group or groups to query, the start date, and the start time from which
to list. The date and time are each specified as six-digit numbers, with the
most significant information first;

When the user selects a newsgroup to browse, the newsreader may tell the
news server that the group was selected. This simplifies the interaction
between newsreader and news server; it removes the need to constantly 
send the name of the newsgroup with each command. The 
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>group</TT
> command simply takes the name of the selected group as 
an argument. Many following commands use the group selected as the 
default, unless another newsgroup is specified explicitly:</P

active messages and the high-water mark are the same in our example, this is
not often the case; in an active news server, some articles may have expired
or been deleted, lowering the number of active messages but leaving the 
high-water mark untouched.</P

To address newsgroup articles, the newsreader must know

article numbers in the current group, or an explicit group if the group name is 
supplied:</P

just the header of the specified article to the newsreader. If the user

While it is normally most efficient to separately transfer the headers
and bodies of selected articles, there are occasions when we are better off
transferring the complete article. A good example of this is in applications
through which we want to transfer all of the artices in a group without any sort of
preselection, such as when we are using an NNTP cache program like
<B
