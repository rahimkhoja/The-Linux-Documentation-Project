>It's often very useful to execute a command on a remote host and
have input or output from that command be read from, or written to, a network
connection.</P
><P
>&#13;




The traditional commands used for executing commands on remote hosts are
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rsh</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rcp</B
>.
We saw an example of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> command in <A
HREF="x-087-2-intro.html"
>Chapter 1</A
> in the section <A
HREF="x-087-2-intro.tcpip.html#X-087-2-INTRO.TCPIP.INTRO"
>Section 1.2.1</A
>.&#8221; We briefly discussed the security
issues associated with it in <A
HREF="x1392.html#X-087-2-INTRO.SECURITY"
>Section 1.5.1</A
>&#8221; and
suggested <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> as a replacement.
The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> package provides replacements called
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slogin</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>, and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>scp</B
>.</P
><P
>&#13;Each of these commands spawns a shell on the remote host and allows the user
to execute commands. Of course, the client needs to have an account on the
remote host where the command is to be executed. Thus, all these commands
use an authentication process. The <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>r</I
> commands use a simple
username and password exchange between the hosts with no encryption, so anyone
listening could easily intercept the passwords. The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
command suite provides a higher level of security: it uses a technique 
called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Public Key Cryptography</B
>, which provides 
authentication and encryption between the hosts to ensure that
neither passwords nor session data are easily intercepted by other hosts.</P
><P
>&#13;It is possible to relax authentication checks for certain users even further. For
instance, if you frequently have to log into other machines on your LAN,
you might want to be admitted without having to type your password every
time. This was always possible with the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>r</I
> commands, but the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> suite allows you to do this a little more easily. It's
still not a great idea because it means that if an account on one machine
is breached, access can be gained to all other accounts that user has
configured for password-less login, but it is very convenient and people will
use it.</P
><P
>Let's talk about removing the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

>Start by removing the <B

CLASS="COMMAND"

commands is to comment out (or remove) their entries in the
<TT

look something like this:

You can comment them by placing a <TT

The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sshd</B
> daemon is the program that listens for network
connections from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> clients, manages authentication, and
executes the requested command. It has one main configuration file called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</TT
> and a special file containing a
key used by the authentication and encryption processes to represent the host
end. Each host and each client has its own key.</P
><P

A utility called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-keygen</B
> is supplied to generate
a random key. This is usually used once at installation time to
generate the host key, which the system administrator usually stores
in a file called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key</TT
>.  Keys can
be of any length of 512 bits or greater. By default,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-keygen</B
> generates keys of 1024 bits in length,
and most people use the default. To generate a random key, you would
invoke the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh-keygen</B

CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> 
program in our example earlier in the book. The first time you attempt a 
connection to a host, the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B

public key of the host and ask you to confirm its identity by prompting you 
with a shortened version of the public key called a 
<B

><P
>The administrator at the remote host should have supplied you in
advance with its public key fingerprint, which you should add to your

administrator has not supplied you the appropriate key, you can
connect to the remote host, but <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B

that it does have a key and prompt you whether you wish to accept the
one offered by the remote host.  Assuming that you're sure no one is
engaging in DNS spoofing and you are in fact talking to the correct
host, answer yes to the prompt.  The relevant key is then stored
automatically in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/known_hosts</TT
> and you
will not be prompted for it again. If, on a future connection attempt, 
the public key retrieved from that host does not match the one that is 
stored, you will be warned, because this represents a potential security 
breach.</P

>You can place <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> in a command pipeline
and pipe program input/output to or from it just like any other command,
except that the input or output is directed to or from the remote host
via the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> connection. Here is an example of how you might
use this capability in combination with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> command
to copy a whole directory with subdirectories and files from a remote host
to the local host:

>Here we surrounded the command we will execute with quotation marks to make it
clear what is passed as an argument to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> and what is used
by the local shell. This command executes the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
>
command on the remote host to archive the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/</TT
> directory
and write the output to standard output. We've piped to an instance of the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tar</B
> command running on our local host in extract mode
reading from standard input.</P

>&#13;Again, we were prompted for the password. Now you can see why we encouraged 
you to configure <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> so
that it doesn't prompt you for passwords all the time! Let's now configure
our local <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> client so that it won't prompt for a password
when connecting to the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vchianti.vbrew.com</SPAN
> host. We mentioned
the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
> file earlier; this is where
it is used. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
> file contains the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>public</I
> keys on any remote user accounts that we wish to
automatically log in to. You can set up automatic logins by copying the 
contents of the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/identity.pub</TT
> from the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>remote</I
>
account into our local <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
> file. It is
vital that the file permissions of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
> 
allow only that you read and write it; anyone may steal and use the
keys to log in to that remote account. To ensure the permissions are correct,
change <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
>, as shown:

>The public keys are a long <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>single</I
> line of plain
text. If you use copy and paste to duplicate the key into your local file, 
be sure to remove any end of line characters that might have been introduced 
along the way. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.ssh/authorized_keys</TT
> file may contain 
many such keys, each on a line of its own.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B

other useful features and options that you will be interested in exploring.
Please refer to the manual pages and other documentation that is supplied
with the package for more information.</P
