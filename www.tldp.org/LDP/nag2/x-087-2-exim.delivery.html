><P
>Exim splits up mail delivery into three different tasks: routing,
directing, and transporting. There are a number of code modules of
each type, and each is separately configurable. Usually a number of
different routers, directors, and transports are set up in the
configuration file.</P
><P
>&#13;Routers resolve remote addresses, determining which host the message
should be sent to and which transport should be used. In
Internet-connected hosts there is often just one router, which does
the resolution by looking up the domain in the DNS. Alternatively,
there may be one router that handles addresses destined for hosts on a
local LAN, and a second to send any other addresses to a single
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>smart host</I
>&#8201;; for example, an ISP's mail server.</P
><P
>&#13;Local addresses are given to the directors, of which there are
normally several, to handle aliasing and forwarding as well as
identifying local mailboxes. Mailing lists can be handled by aliasing
or forwarding directors. If an address gets aliased or forwarded, any
generated addresses are handled independently by the routers or
directors, as necessary. By far the most common case will be delivery
to a mailbox, but messages may also be piped into a command or
appended to a file other than the default mailbox.</P
><P
>&#13;A transport is responsible for implementing a method of delivery; for
example, sending the message over an SMTP connection or adding it to
a specific mailbox. Routers and directors select which transport to
use for each recipient address. If a transport fails, Exim either
generates a bounce message or defers the address for a later retry.</P
><P
>With Exim, you have a lot of freedom in configuring these tasks. For each of 
them, a number of drivers are available, from which you can choose those you 
need. You describe them to Exim in different sections of its configuration 
file. The transports are defined first, followed by the directors, and then 
the routers. There are no built-in defaults, though Exim is distributed with 
a default configuration file that covers simple cases. If you want to change 
Exim's routing policy or modify a transport, it is easiest to start from the 
default configuration and make changes rather than attempt to set up a 
complete configuration from scratch.</P

>&#13;
When given an address to deliver, Exim first checks whether the domain
is one that is handled on the local host by matching it against a
list in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>local_domains</TT
> configuration
variable. If this option is not set, the local host name is used as
the only local domain. If the domain is local, the address is handed
to the directors. Otherwise, it is handed to the routers to find out
which host to forward a message to.<A

NAME="X-087-2-EXIM.DIRECTORS"
>19.6.2. Delivering Messages to Local Addresses</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
Most commonly, a local address is just a user's login name, in which case
the message is delivered to the user's mailbox,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/mail</TT
>/<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>user-name</I
></TT
>.
Other cases include aliases, mailing list names, and mail forwarding by the
user. In these cases, the local address expands to a new list of addresses,
which may be either local or remote.</P
><P
>Apart from these &#8220;normal&#8221; addresses, Exim can handle other
types of local message destinations, like filenames and pipe commands.
When delivering to a file, Exim appends the message, creating the file
if necessary. File and pipe destinations are not addresses in their
own right, so you can't send mail to, say, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/etc/passwd@vbrew.com</SPAN
> and expect to
overwrite the password file; deliveries to a specific file are valid
only if they come from forwarding or alias files.  Note, however, that
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/etc/passwd@vbrew.com</SPAN
> is a
syntactically valid email address, but if Exim received it, it would
(typically) search for a user whose login name was <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/etc/passwd</SPAN
>, fail to find one, and
bounce the message.</P
><P
>&#13;
 
In an alias list or forwarding file, a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>filename</I
> is
anything that begins with a slash (/&#8201;) that does not parse as a fully qualified
email address. For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp/junk</TT
> in a forwarding or
alias file is interpreted as a file name, but
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/tmp/junk@vbrew.com</SPAN
>
is an email address, though it is not likely to be a very useful one. However, 
valid addresses of this type are seen when sending mail through X.400 gateways,
because X.400 addresses start with a slash.</P
><P
>&#13;
Similarly, a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pipe command</I
> may be any Unix command preceded
by the pipe symbol (|), unless the string parses as a valid email address
complete with domain. Unless you have changed the configuration, Exim does not 
use a shell to run the command; instead, it splits it up into a command name, arguments itself, and runs it directly. The message is fed to the command
on its standard input.</P
><P
>For example, to gate a mailing list into a local newsgroup, you might use a
shell script named <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gateit</B
>, and set up a local alias that
delivers all messages from this mailing list to the script using
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>|gateit</TT
>. If the command line contains a comma, it and the 
preceding pipe symbol must be enclosed in double quotes. </P

></H3
><P
>&#13;
A local address most commonly denotes a user's mailbox. This is normally
located in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/mail</TT
> and has the name of the
user, who also owns the file. If it does not exist, it is created by
Exim. </P
><P
>In some configurations, the group is set to the user's group and the
mode is 0600. In these cases, delivery processes are run as the user,
and the user may delete the mailbox entirely. In other
configurations, the mailbox's group is <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>mail</SPAN
>, and it has mode 660; delivery processes 
are run under a system uid and group <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>mail</SPAN
>, and users cannot delete their
mailbox files, though they can empty them.</P
><P
>Note that although <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/mail</TT
> is currently
the standard place to put the mailbox files, some mail software may be
compiled to use different paths, for example,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/spool/mail</TT
>. If delivery to users on your
machine fails consistently, you should see if it helps to make this a
symbolic link to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/mail</TT
>.</P
><P
>The addresses <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>MAILER-DAEMON</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>postmaster</SPAN
> should normally
appear in your alias file, expanding into the email address of the
system administrator.  <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>MAILER-DAEMON</SPAN
> is used by Exim as the sender
address in bounce messages. It is also recommended that <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>root</SPAN
> be set up as an alias for an
administrator, especially when deliveries are being run under the
permissions of the recipient users, in order to avoid running any
delivery as <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>root</SPAN
>.</P

>19.6.2.2. Forwarding</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;

Users can redirect their mail to alternative addresses by creating a
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.forward</TT
> file in their home directories. This contains 
a list of recipients separated by commas and/or newlines.
All lines of the file are read and interpreted. Any type of address may
be used. A practical example of a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.forward</TT
>
file for vacations might be:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>janet, "|vacation"</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

In other descriptions of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.forward</TT
> files, you might 
see the username at the start preceded by a backslash. This was
necessary in some older MTAs to stop a search for a 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.forward</TT
> for the new name, which could lead to 
looping. The backslash is not necessary in Exim, which automatically 
avoids loops of this kind.<A
NAME="AEN16212"
HREF="#FTN.AEN16212"
>[2]</A
>
However, a backslash is permitted, and in fact it does make a difference 
in configurations where several domains are being handled at once. 
Without a backslash, an unqualified username is qualified with a
default domain; with a backslash the incoming domain is preserved.</P
><P
>The first address in the forward file delivers the incoming message 
to <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>janet</I
>'s mailbox, 
while the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>vacation</B
> command returns a short notification to 
the sender.<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNEX07"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNEX07"
>[3]</A
></P
><P
>&#13;
In addition to supporting &#8220;traditional&#8221; forwarding files,
Exim can be configured to allow more complex files called
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>filters</I
>.  Instead of being just a list of
forwarding addresses, a filter file can contain tests on the contents
of the incoming message so that, for example, messages could be
forwarded only if the subject contained the message &#8220;urgent.&#8221; The
system administrator must decide whether to allow users this
flexibility.</P

Exim is able to handle alias files compatible with Berkeley's
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> alias files. Entries in the alias file can have 
the following form:

<TABLE

></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>recipients</I
></TT
> is a comma-separated list of
addresses that will be substituted for the alias. The recipient list
may be continued across newlines if the next line begins with whitespace.</P
><P
>A special feature allows Exim to handle mailing lists that are held
separately from the alias file: if you specify
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>:include:</TT
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
> as a
recipient, Exim reads the specified file and substitutes its contents
as a list of recipients. An alternative to handling mailing lists is
shown later in this chapter in <A
HREF="x-087-2-exim.delivery.html#X-087-2-EXIM.DIRECTOR.MAILING-LISTS"
>Section 19.6.4</A
>.&#8221;</P
><P
>&#13;The main aliases file is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/aliases</TT
>. If you
make this file world-writable or group-writeable, Exim will refuse to
use it and will defer local deliveries. You can control the test it
applies to the file's permissions by setting <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>modemask</TT
>
in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>system_aliases</TT
> director.</P
><P

>19.6.4. Mailing Lists</A
></H2
><P
>&#13; 

Instead of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>aliases</TT
> file, mailing lists may
also be managed by means a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>forwardfile</TT
> director. The
lists are all kept in a single directory such as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/exim/lists/</TT
>, and a mailing list named
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>nag-bugs</SPAN
> is described by the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>lists/nag-bugs</TT
>. This should contain the members'
addresses separated by commas or newlines. Lines beginning with a hash sign
(<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#</TT
>) are treated as comments. A simple director to use such
data is as follows:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>lists:
  driver = forwardfile
  file = /etc/exim/lists/${local_part}
  no_check_local_user
  errors_to = ${local_part}-request</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

When this director runs, the values of the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>file</TT
> and 
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>errors_to</TT
> options are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>expanded</I
>. 
Expansion causes certain portions of the strings beginning with dollar 
characters to be replaced every time the string is used. The simplest 
kind of expansion is the insertion of the value of one of Exim's 
variables, and this is what is happening here. The substring 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>${local_&#8201;part}</TT
> substitutes the value of the 
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$local_&#8201;part</TT
>, which is the local part of the address 
that is being processed.</P
><P
>For each mailing list, a user (or alias or mailing list) named
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>listname-request</I
></TT
> should exist; any errors
occurring when resolving an address or delivering to a list member are
reported to this address.</P
