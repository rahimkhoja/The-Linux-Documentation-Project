></H1

>&#13;




With PPP, each system may require its peer to authenticate itself
using one of two authentication protocols: the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Password Authentication Protocol</I
> (PAP), and the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol</I
>
(CHAP).  When a connection is established, each end can request the
other to authenticate itself, regardless of whether it is the caller
or the callee.  In the description that follows, we will loosely talk
of &#8220;client&#8221; and &#8220;server&#8221; when we want to
distinguish between the system sending authentication requests and the
system responding to them. A PPP daemon can ask its peer for
authentication by sending yet another LCP configuration request
identifying the desired authentication protocol.</P

NAME="AEN7101"
>8.8.1. PAP Versus CHAP</A
></H2
><P
>PAP, which is offered by many Internet Service Providers, works
basically the same way as the normal login procedure. The client
authenticates itself by sending a username and a (optionally
encrypted) password to the server, which the server compares to its
secrets database.<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNPP11"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNPP11"
>[1]</A
>
This technique is vulnerable to eavesdroppers, who may try to obtain the
password by listening in on the serial line, and to repeated trial and error
attacks.</P
><P
>CHAP does not have these deficiencies. With CHAP, the server sends a randomly
generated &#8220;challenge&#8221; string to the client, along with its
hostname. The client uses the hostname to look up the appropriate secret,
combines it with the challenge, and encrypts the string using a one-way
hashing function. The result is returned to the server along with the client's
hostname. The server now performs the same computation, and acknowledges the
client if it arrives at the same result.</P
><P
>CHAP also doesn't require the client to authenticate itself only at
startup time, but sends challenges at regular intervals to make sure
the client hasn't been replaced by an intruder, for instance by
switching phone lines, or because of a modem configuration error that
causes the PPP daemon not to notice that the original phone call has
dropped out and someone else has dialed in.</P
><P
> 
 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> keeps the secret keys for PAP and CHAP in two
separate files called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</TT
>.  By entering
a remote host in one or the other file, you have fine control over
whether PAP or CHAP is used to authenticate yourself with your peer,
and vice versa.</P
><P
>By default, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> doesn't require authentication from the
remote host, but it will agree to authenticate itself when requested by the
remote host. Since CHAP is so much stronger than PAP, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>
tries to use the former whenever possible.  If the peer does not support it, or
if <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> can't find a CHAP secret for the remote system in
its <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chap-secrets</TT
> file, it reverts to PAP. If it doesn't
have a PAP secret for its peer either, it refuses to authenticate
altogether. As a consequence, the connection is shut down.</P
><P
>You can modify this behavior in several ways. When given
the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>auth</TT
> keyword, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>
requires the peer to authenticate itself. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>
agrees to use either CHAP or PAP as long as it has a secret for the
peer in its CHAP or PAP database. There are other options to turn a
particular authentication protocol on or off, but I won't describe
them here.</P
><P
> 
If all systems you talk to with PPP agree to authenticate themselves with
you, you should put the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>auth</TT
> option in the global
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp/options</TT
> file and define passwords for each
system in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chap-secrets</TT
> file. If a system doesn't
support CHAP, add an entry for it to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pap-secrets</TT
>
file. That way, you can make sure no unauthenticated system connects to your
host.</P
><P
>The next two sections discuss the two PPP secrets files,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pap-secrets</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chap-secrets</TT
>.
They are located in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ppp</TT
> and contain triplets
of clients, servers, and passwords, optionally followed by a list of IP
addresses.  The interpretation of the client and server fields is
different for CHAP and PAP, and also depends on whether we authenticate
ourselves with the peer, or whether we require the server to authenticate
itself with us.</P

When it has to authenticate itself with a server using CHAP,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> searches the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chap-secrets</TT
>
file for an entry with the client field equal to the local hostname, and
the server field equal to the remote hostname sent in the CHAP challenge.
When requiring the peer to authenticate itself, the roles are simply reversed:
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> then looks for an entry with the client field
equal to the remote hostname (sent in the client's CHAP response), and the
server field equal to the local hostname.</P

It then produces the CHAP response from the challenge string and the secret
(<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

<SPAN

string and its fully qualified hostname,
<SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>c3po</SPAN
> constructs a CHAP response in
the way we discussed, and returns it to

CLASS="COMMAND"

extracts the client hostname
(<SPAN

<SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

does this, so <B

the result to <SPAN

><P
>&#13;

The optional fourth field lists the IP addresses that are acceptable
for the client named in the first field. The addresses can be given
in dotted quad notation or as hostnames that are looked up with the
resolver.  For instance, if <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>c3po</SPAN
>
asks to use an IP address during IPCP negotiation that is not in this
list, the request is rejected, and IPCP is shut down. In the
sample file shown above, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>c3po</SPAN
>
is therefore limited to using its own IP address. If the address field is
empty, any addresses are allowed; a value of
&#8220;<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-</TT
>&#8221; prevents the use of IP with that client
altogether.</P
><P
>The third line of the sample <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>chap-secrets</TT
> file
allows any host to establish a PPP link with
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> because a client or server field
of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</TT
> is a wildcard matching any hostname. The only
requirements are that the connecting host must know the secret and that it must use
the IP address associated with
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>pub.vbrew.com</SPAN
>. Entries with wildcard
hostnames may appear anywhere in the secrets file, since
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> will always use the best match it can find for
the server/client pair.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> may need some help forming hostnames. As explained
before, the remote hostname is always provided by the peer in the CHAP
challenge or response packet.  The local hostname is obtained by calling
the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gethostname(2)</TT
> function by default. If you have
set the system name to your unqualified hostname, you also have to provide
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B

<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>domain</TT

The PAP secrets file is very similar to CHAP's. The first two
fields always contain a username and a server name; the third holds the
PAP secret.  When the remote host sends its authentication information,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> uses the entry that has a server field equal to the
local hostname, and a user field equal to the username sent in the request.
When it is necessary for us to send our credentials to the peer,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
> uses the secret that has a user field equal to the
local username and the server field equal to the remote hostname.</P
