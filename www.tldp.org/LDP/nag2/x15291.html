>18.8.2. Managing Mail Aliases</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;

Mail aliases are a powerful feature that enable mail to be directed to
mailboxes that are alternate names for users or processes on a
destination host. For example, it is common practice to have feedback
or comments relating to a World Wide Web server to be directed to
&#8220;webmaster.&#8221; Often there isn't a user known as
&#8220;webmaster&#8221; on the target machine, instead it is an alias
of another system user. Another common use of mail aliases is
exploited by mailing list server programs in which an alias directs
incoming messages to the list server program for handling.</P
><P
>&#13;The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/aliases</TT
> file is where the aliases are stored.
The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> program consults this file when determining
how to handle an incoming mail message. If it finds an entry in this file
matching the target user in the mail message, it redirects the message to
wherever the entry describes.</P
><P
>Specifically there are three things that aliases allow to happen:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>They provide a shorthand or well-known name for mail to be addressed to in
order to go to one or more persons.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>They can invoke a program with the mail message as the input to the program.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>They can send mail to a file.</P
></LI

><P
>All systems require aliases for
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>Postmaster</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>MAILER-DAEMON</SPAN
> to be RFC-compliant.</P
><P
>Always be extremely aware of security when defining aliases that invoke
programs or write to programs, since <B

runs with <SPAN

>18.8.3. Using a Smart Host</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
Sometimes a host finds mail that it is unable to deliver directly to
the desired remote host. It is often convenient to have a single host on a
network take on the role of managing transmission of mail to remote hosts
that are difficult to reach, rather than have each local host try to do this
independently.</P
><P
>There are a few good reasons to have a single host take on mail
management.  You can simplify management by having only one host 
with a comprehensive mail configuration that knows how to handle all
of the different mail transport types, such as UUCP, Usenet, etc. All
other hosts need only a single tranport protocol to send their mail to
this central host. Hosts that fill this central mail routing and
forwarding role are called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>smart hosts</I
>.  If you
have a smart host that will accept mail from you, you can send it mail
of any sort and it will manage the routing and transmission of that
mail to the desired remote destinations.</P
><P
>Another good application for smart host configurations is to manage
transmission of mail across a private firewall. An organization may
elect to install a private IP network and use their own,
unregistered IP addresses.  The private network may be connected to
the Internet through a firewall.  Sending mail to and from hosts in
the private network to the outside world using SMTP would not be
possible in a conventional configuration because the hosts are not
able to accept or establish direct network connections to hosts on the
Internet. Instead, the organization could elect to have the firewall
provide a mail smart host function. The smart host running on the
firewall is able to establish direct network connections with hosts
both on the private network and on the Internet. The smart host would
accept mail from both hosts on the private network and the Internet,
store them in local storage and then manage the retransmission of that
mail to the correct host directly.</P
><P
>Smart hosts are usually used when all other methods of delivery have
failed.  In the case of the organization with the private network, it
would be perfectly reasonable to have the hosts attempt to deliver
mail directly first, and if that fails then to send it to the smart
host. This relieves the smart host of a lot of traffic because other
hosts can directly send mail to other hosts on the private network.</P
><P
>&#13;<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> provides a simple method of configuring
a smart host using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SMART_HOST</TT
> feature; when 
implementing it in the Virtual Brewery configuration, we do exactly this. The 
relevant portions of our configuration that define the smart host are:

<TABLE

></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SMART_HOST</TT
> macro allows you to specify the host that
should relay all outgoing mail that you are unable to deliver directly,
and the mail transport protocol to use to talk to it.</P
><P
>In our configuration we are using the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>uucp-new</TT
> transport
to UUCP host <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>moria</I
>. If we wanted to configure
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> to use an SMTP-based Smart Host, we would instead
use something like:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>&#13;define(`SMART_HOST', `mail.isp.net')</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

We don't need to specify SMTP as the transport, as it is the default.</P
><P
>Can you guess what the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LOCAL_NET_CONFIG</TT
> macro and the
rewrite rule might be doing?</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LOCAL_NET_CONFIG</TT
> macro allows you to add raw
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> rewrite rules to your configuration that define
what mail should stay within the local mail system. In our example, we've used 
a rule that matches any email address where the host belongs to our
domain (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.$m.</TT
>) and rewrite it so that it is sent directly 
to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SMTP</TT
> mailer.
This ensures that any message for a host on our local domain is directed
immediately to the SMTP mailer and forwarded to that host, rather than falling
through to our smart host, which is the default treatment.</P

If you've subscribed to a mailing list, published your email address on a
web site, or posted an article to UseNet, you will most likely have
begun to receive unsolicited advertising email. It is commonplace now
for people to scour the net in search of email addresses to add to mailing
lists that they then sell to companies seeking to advertise their products.
This sort of mass-mailing behavior is commonly called spamming. </P

><P
>&#13;The Real-time Blackhole List is a public facility provided to help reduce the
volume of unsolicited advertising you have to contend with. Known email
sources and hosts are listed in a queryable database on the Internet. They're
entered there by people who have received unsolicited advertising from some
email address. Major domains sometimes find themselves on the list because of 
slip-ups in shutting down spam. While some people complain about 
particular choices made by the maintainers of the list, it remains 
very popular and disagreements are usually worked out quickly. Full details 
on how the service is operated may be found
from the home site of the Mail Abuse Protection System at

address of each incoming mail message against the Real-time Blackhole List to
determine whether to accept the message. If you run a large site

An alternative system that offers greater flexibility and control at

<SPAN

database allows you to configure which hosts or users you will accept
mail from and which you will relay mail for.</P
><P
>Managing who you will relay mail for is important, as it is another technique
commonly employed by spamming hosts to circumvent systems such as the Real-time
Blackhole List just described. Instead of sending the mail to you directly,
spammers will relay the mail via some other unsuspecting host who allows it.
The incoming SMTP connection then doesn't come from the known spamming host,
it instead comes from the relay host. To ensure that your own mail hosts
aren't used in this way, you should relay mail only for known hosts. Versions
of <B

relaying disabled by default, so for those you'll need to use the access
database to enable individual hosts to relay.</P

format. Each line of the table contains an access rule. The lefthand side of

The <B

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

support for the virtual user table, where we configure virtual
email hosting. The virtual user table maps incoming mail destined for some 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>user@host</I
> to some <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>otheruser@otherhost</I
>.
You can think of this as an advanced mail alias feature, one that operates
using not just the destination user, but also the destination domain.</P
><P
>To configure the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>virtusertable</SPAN

feature, add the feature to your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.mc</TT
>
configuration as shown:

><P
>By default, the file containing the rules to perform translations will be
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/mail/virtusertable</TT
>. You can override this by
supplying an argument to the macro definition; consult a
detailed <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> reference to learn about what options
are available.</P
><P
>The format of the virtual user table is very simple. The lefthand side of
each line contains a pattern representing the original destination mail
address; the righthand side has a pattern representing the mail address the
virtual hosted address will be mapped to.</P
><P
>The following example shows three possible types of entries:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>samiam@bovine.net     colin
sunny@bovine.net      darkhorse@mystery.net
@dairy.org            mail@jhm.org
@artist.org           $1@red.firefly.com</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

In this example, we are virtual hosting three domains:
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>bovine.net</I
>, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>dairy.org</I
>, and
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>artist.org</I
>.</P
><P
>The first entry redirects mail sent to a user in the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>bovine.net</I
> virtual domain to a local
user on the machine. The second entry redirects mail to a user in the same
virtual domain to a user in another domain. The third example redirects all
mail addressed to any user in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>dairly.org</I
> virtual
domain to a single remote mail address. Finally, the last entry redirects
any mail to a user in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>artist.org</I
> virtual domain to
the same user in another domain; for example,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>julie@artists.org</SPAN
> would be redirected to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>julie@red.firefly.com</SPAN
>.</P
