>19.4. Mail Delivery Modes</A

As noted previously, Exim is able to deliver messages immediately or
queue them for later processing. All incoming mail is stored in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>input</TT
> directory below
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/exim</TT
>. When queueing is not in
operation, a delivery process is started for each message as soon as
it arrives. Otherwise, it is left on the queue until a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>queue-runner</I
> process picks it up. Queueing can be
made unconditional by setting <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>queue_only</TT
> in the
configuration file, or it can be conditional on the 1-minute system
load by a setting such as:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>queue_only_load = 4</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

which causes messages to be queued if the system load exceeds
4.<A
NAME="AEN16030"
HREF="#FTN.AEN16030"
>[1]</A
></P
><P
>If your host is not permanently connected to the Internet, you may
want to turn on queueing for remote addresses, while allowing Exim to
perform local deliveries immediately. You can do this by setting:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>queue_remote_domains = *</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

in the configuration file.</P
><P
> 
If you turn on any form of queuing, you have to make sure the queues
are checked regularly, probably every 10 or 15 minutes. Even without
any explicit queueing options, the queues need to be checked for
messages that have been deferred because of temporary delivery
failures. If you run Exim in daemon mode, you must add the
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;q15m</TT
> option on the command line to process the
queue every 15 minutes.  You can also invoke <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exim
&#8211;q</B
> from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron</B
> at these intervals.</P
><P
>&#13;
You can display the current mail queue by invoking Exim with the
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;bp</TT
> option. Equivalently, you can make
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mailq</B
> a link to Exim, and invoke
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mailq</B
>&#8201;:

in the message queue. It has been successfully delivered to
<SPAN

yet been delivered to <SPAN

the queue for two hours. The size of the message is 52K, and the ID by
which Exim identifies this message is
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>12EwGE-0005jD-00</TT
>. You can find out why the delivery
is not yet complete by looking at the message's individual log file,
which is kept in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>msglog</TT
> directory in Exim's
spool directory. The <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;Mvl</TT
> option is an easy way
of doing this:

<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"

2000-01-30 17:28:13 harry@example.net: remote_smtp transport deferred: 
  Connection timed out</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Individual log files keep a copy of log entries for each message so you can
easily inspect them. The same information could have been extracted from the
main log file using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exigrep</B
> utility:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>$ <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>exigrep 12EwGE-0005jD-00 /var/log/exim/exim_mainlog</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

That would take longer, especially on a busy system where the log files
can get quite big. The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exigrep</B
> utility comes into its own
when looking for information about more than one message. Its first argument
is a regular expression, and it picks out all the log lines concerned with any
messages that have at least one log line that matches the expression. Thus it
can be used to pick out all messages for one specific address, or all those to
or from a specific host.</P
><P
>You can keep a general watch on what a running Exim is doing by running
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tail</B
> on its main log file. Another way of doing this is to
run the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>eximon</B
> utility that comes with Exim. This is an X11
application that puts up a scrolling display of the main log, and also shows
a list of messages that are awaiting delivery, as well as some stripcharts
about delivery activity.</P
