One of the major applications of NIS is synchronizing user and account
information on all hosts in an NIS domain. Consequently, you usually keep
only a small local <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> file, to which
site-wide information from the NIS maps is appended. However, simply
enabling NIS lookups for this service in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>nsswitch.conf</TT
>
is not nearly enough.</P
><P
>When relying on the password information distributed by NIS, you first
have to make sure that the numeric user IDs of any users you have in
your local <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> file match the NIS server's idea of
user IDs. Consistency in user IDs is important for other purposes as
well, like mounting NFS volumes from other hosts in your network.</P
><P
> 
 
If any of the numeric IDs in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/group</TT
> differ from those in the maps, you have to
adjust file ownerships for all files that belong to that user. First, you
should change all uids and gids in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>group</TT
> to the new values, then find that all files
that belong to the users just changed and change their
ownership.  Assume <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN
>
used to have a user ID of 9 and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>okir</SPAN
>
had a user ID of 103, which were changed to some other value; you could
then
issue the following commands as root:

<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
># <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>find / -uid   9 -print &#62;/tmp/uid.9</B

# <TT

><B
>find / -uid 103 -print &#62;/tmp/uid.103</B
></TT
>
# <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>cat /tmp/uid.9   | xargs chown news</B
></TT
>
# <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>cat /tmp/uid.103 | xargs chown okir</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>It is important that you execute these commands with the new
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> file installed, and that you collect all
filenames before you change the ownership of any of them. To update the
group ownerships of files, use a similar method with the gid instead of the 
uid, and chgrp instead of chown.</P
><P
>Once you do this, the numerical uids and gids on your system will
agree with those on all other hosts in your NIS domain.  The next step
is to add configuration lines to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>nsswitch.conf</TT
>
that enable NIS lookups for user and group information:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
># /etc/nsswitch.conf - passwd and group treatment
passwd: nis files
group:  nis files</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
> 
This affects where the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>login</B
> command and all its
friends look for user information. When a user tries to log in,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>login</B
> queries the NIS maps first, and if this
lookup fails, falls back to the local files. Usually, you will remove
almost all users from your local files, and only leave entries for
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>root</SPAN
> and generic accounts like
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>mail</SPAN
> in it.  This is because
some vital system tasks may have to map uids to usernames or vice
versa.  For example, administrative <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron</B
> jobs may
execute the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>su</TT
> command to temporarily become
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN
>, or the UUCP subsystem may
mail a status report.  If <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN
>
and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>uucp</SPAN
> don't have entries in
the local <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> file, these jobs will fail
miserably during an NIS brownout.</P
><P
>Lastly, if you are using either the old NIS implementation (supported by the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>compat</SPAN
> mode for the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>group</TT
> files in the
NYS or glibc implementations), you must insert the unwieldy special entries
into them. These entries represent where the NIS derived records will
be inserted into the database of information. The entries can be added
anywhere, but are usually just added to the end. The entries to add for the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> file are:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>+::::::</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

and for the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/groups</TT
> file:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>+:::</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>With both glibc 2.x and NYS you can override parameters in a user&#8217;s 
record received from the NIS server by creating entries with a &#8220;+&#8221;
prepended to the login name, and exclude specified users by creating
entries with a &#8220;-&#8221; prepended to the login name.
For example the entries:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>+stuart::::::/bin/jacl</B
></TT
>
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>-jedd::::::</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

would override the shell specified for the user
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>stuart</SPAN
> supplied by the NIS server,
and would disallow the user <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>jedd</SPAN
> from
logging in on this machine. Any fields left blank use the information
supplied by the NIS server.</P
><P
>There are two big caveats in order here. First, the setup as described up to
here works only for login suites that don't use shadow passwords. The
intricacies of using shadow passwords with NIS will be discussed in the next 
section.
Second, the login commands are not the only ones that access the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> file&#8212;look at the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls</B
>
command, which most people use almost constantly. Whenever compiling a long
listing, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls</B
> displays the symbolic names for user
and group owners of a file; that is, for each uid and gid it encounters,
it has to query the NIS server. An NIS query takes slightly longer to
perform than the equivalent lookup in a local file. You may find that sharing
your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>group</TT
> information
using NIS causes a noticable reduction in the performance of some programs that
use this information frequently.</P
><P
>Still, this is not the whole story. Imagine what happens if a user wants to
change her password. Usually, she will invoke <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd</B
>, which
reads the new password and updates the local <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>passwd</TT
> file.
This is impossible with NIS, since that file isn't available locally anymore,
but having users log into the NIS server whenever they want to change their
passwords is not an option, either. Therefore, NIS provides a drop-in
replacement for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd</B
> called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>yppasswd</B
>,
which handles password changes under NIS. To change the password
on the server host, it contacts the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>yppasswdd</B
> daemon on
that host via RPC, and provides it with the updated password information.
Usually you install <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>yppasswd</B
> over the normal program by
doing something like this:

 
<TABLE

></TT
>
# <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>ln yppasswd passwd</B
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>At the same time, you have to install <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpc.yppasswdd</B
> on the
server and start it from a network script. This will effectively hide any of
the contortions of NIS from your users.</P
