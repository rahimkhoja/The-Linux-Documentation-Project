The Linux Documentation Project is a group of volunteers who have
worked to produce books (guides), HOWTO documents, and manual pages on
topics ranging from installation to kernel programming. The LDP works

The OpenProjects IRC Network is an IRC network devoted entirely to
Open Projects&#8212;Open Source and Open Hardware alike. Some of its
channels are designed to provide online Linux support services. IRC
stands for Internet Relay Chat, and is a network service that allows
you to talk interactively on the Internet to other users. IRC networks
support multiple channels on which groups of people talk. Whatever you
type in a channel is seen by all other users of that channel.</P

>There are a number of active channels on the OpenProjects IRC network
where you will find users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week who are
willing and able to help you solve any Linux problems you may have, or
just chat. You can use this service by installing an IRC client like

><P
>&#13;








There is no single distribution of the Linux software; instead, there
are many distributions, such as Debian, RedHat, Caldera, Corel, SuSE,
and Slackware. Each distribution contains everything you need to run a
complete Linux system: the kernel, basic utilities, libraries, support
files, and applications software.</P
><P
>Linux distributions may be obtained via a number of online sources, such as
the Internet. Each of the major distributions has its own FTP and web site.
Some of these sites are:

Many of the popular general FTP archive sites also mirror various
Linux distributions. The best-known of these sites are:

><br>
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>mirror.aarnet.edu.au:/pub/linux/distributions/</SPAN
></P
></P
><P
>Many of the modern distributions can be installed directly from the
Internet.  There is a lot of software to download for a typical
installation, though, so you'd probably want to do this only if you
have a high-speed, permanent network connection, or if you just need
to update an existing installation.<A

>[1]</A
></P
><P
>Linux may be purchased on CD-ROM from an increasing number of software
vendors. If your local computer store doesn't have it, perhaps you
should ask them to stock it! Most of the popular distributions can be
obtained on CD-ROM. Some vendors produce products containing multiple
CD-ROMs, each of which provides a different Linux distribution. This
is an ideal way to try a number of different distributions before you
settle on your favorite one.</P
