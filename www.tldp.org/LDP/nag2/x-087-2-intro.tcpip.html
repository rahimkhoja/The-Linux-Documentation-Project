Modern networking applications require a sophisticated approach to
carrying data from one machine to another. If you are managing a Linux
machine that has many users, each of whom may wish to simultaneously
connect to remote hosts on a network, you need a way of allowing them
to share your network connection without interfering with each
other. The approach that a large number of modern networking protocols
uses is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>packet-switching</I
>. A
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>packet</I
> is a small chunk of data that is
transferred from one machine to another across the network. The
switching occurs as the datagram is carried across each link in the
network. A packet-switched network shares a single network link among
many users by alternately sending packets from one user to another
across that link.</P
><P
> The solution that
Unix systems, and subsequently many non-Unix systems, have adopted is
known as TCP/IP. When talking about TCP/IP networks you will hear the
term <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>datagram</I
>, which technically has a special
meaning but is often used interchangeably with
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>packet</I
>. In this section, we will have a look at
underlying concepts of the TCP/IP protocols.</P

TCP/IP traces its origins to a research project funded by the United States
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1969. The ARPANET was an
experimental network that was converted into an operational one in 1975 after
it had proven to be a success.</P
><P
>&#13;

In 1983, the new protocol suite TCP/IP was adopted as a standard, and
all hosts on the network were required to use it.  When ARPANET
finally grew into the Internet (with ARPANET itself passing out of
existence in 1990), the use of TCP/IP had spread to networks beyond
the Internet itself. Many companies have now built corporate TCP/IP
networks, and the Internet has grown to a point at which it could
almost be considered a mainstream consumer technology. It is difficult
to read a newspaper or magazine now without seeing reference to the
Internet; almost everyone can now use it.</P
><P
>&#13; For something concrete to look at as we
discuss TCP/IP throughout the following sections, we will consider
Groucho Marx University (GMU), situated somewhere in Fredland, as an
example.  Most departments run their own Local Area Networks, while
some share one and others run several of them. They are all
interconnected and hooked to the Internet through a single high-speed
link.</P
><P
>&#13;Suppose your Linux box is connected to a LAN of Unix hosts at the Mathematics
department, and its name is <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>. To
access a host at the Physics department, say
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>,
you enter the following command:

Welcome to the Physics Department at GMU
(ttyq2) login:</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
> 
At the prompt, you enter your login name, say
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>andres</SPAN
>, and your password. You are then
given a shell<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNIT02"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNIT02"
>[1]</A
> on <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>, to which you
can type as if you were sitting at the system's console. After you exit the
shell, you are returned to your own machine's prompt. You have just used one
of the instantaneous, interactive applications that TCP/IP provides: remote
login.</P
><P
>&#13;
 
 
While being logged into <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>,
you might also want to run a graphical user interface application,
like a word processing program, a graphics drawing program, or even a
World Wide Web browser. The X windows system is a fully network-aware
graphical user environment, and it is available for many different
computing systems. To tell this application that you want to have its
windows displayed on your host's screen, you have to set the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DISPLAY</SPAN
> environment variable:
<TABLE

></P
><P
>If you now start your application, it will contact your X server instead of
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>'s, and display all its windows
on your screen. Of course, this requires that you have X11 runnning on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>. The point here is that TCP/IP
allows <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
> to send X11 packets back and
forth to give you the illusion that you're on a single system. The network
is almost transparent here.</P
><P
> 
Another very important application in TCP/IP networks is NFS, which
stands for <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Network File System</I
>. It is another
form of making the network transparent, because it basically allows
you to treat directory hierarchies from other hosts as if they
were local file systems and look like any other directories on your
host. For example, all users' home directories can be kept on a
central server machine from which all other hosts on the LAN mount
them. The effect is that users can log in to any machine and find
themselves in the same home directory. Similarly, it is possible to
share large amounts of data (such as a database, documentation or
application programs) among many hosts by maintaining one copy of
the data on a server and allowing other hosts to access it. We will
come back to NFS in <A
HREF="x-087-2-nfs.html"
>Chapter 14</A
>.</P
><P
>Of course, these are only examples of what you can do with TCP/IP networks.
The possibilities are almost limitless, and we'll introduce you to more as you
read on through the book.</P
><P
>We will now have a closer look at the way TCP/IP works. This information will
help you understand how and why you have to configure your machine. We will
start by examining the hardware, and slowly work our way up.</P

>1.2.2. Ethernets</A
></H2
><P
>&#13; 
 
The most common type of LAN hardware is known as <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Ethernet</I
>.
In its simplest form, it consists of a single cable with hosts attached to it
through connectors, taps, or transceivers. Simple Ethernets are relatively
inexpensive to install, which together with a net transfer rate of 10, 100,
or even 1,000 Megabits per second, accounts for much of its popularity.</P
><P
>&#13;




Ethernets come in three flavors: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>thick</I
>,
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>thin</I
>, and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>twisted pair</I
>.
Thin and thick Ethernet each use a coaxial cable, differing in
diameter and the way you may attach a host to this cable. Thin
Ethernet uses a T-shaped &#8220;BNC&#8221; connector, which you insert
into the cable and twist onto a plug on the back of your computer.
Thick Ethernet requires that you drill a small hole into the cable,
and attach a transceiver using a &#8220;vampire tap.&#8221; One or
more hosts can then be connected to the transceiver. Thin and thick
Ethernet cable can run for a maximum of 200 and 500 meters
respectively, and are also called 10base-2 and 10base-5. The
&#8220;base&#8221; refers to &#8220;baseband modulation&#8221; and
simply means that the data is directly fed onto the cable without any
modem. The number at the start refers to the speed in Megabits per
second, and the number at the end is the maximum length of the cable
in hundreds of metres. Twisted pair uses a cable made of two pairs of
copper wires and usually requires additional hardware known as
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>active hubs</I
>. Twisted pair is also known as
10base-T, the &#8220;T&#8221; meaning twisted pair. The 100 Megabits
per second version is known as 100base-T.</P
><P
>To add a host to a thin Ethernet installation, you have to disrupt
network service for at least a few minutes because you have to cut the
cable to insert the connector. Although adding a host to a thick
Ethernet system is a little complicated, it does not typically bring
down the network. Twisted pair Ethernet is even simpler. It uses a
device called a &#8220;hub,&#8221; which serves as an interconnection
point. You can insert and remove hosts from a hub without interrupting
any other users at all.</P
><P
>Many people prefer thin Ethernet for small networks because it is very
inexpensive; PC cards come for as little as US $30 (many
companies are literally throwing them out now), and cable is in the
range of a few cents per meter. However, for large-scale
installations, either thick Ethernet or twisted pair is more
appropriate. For example, the Ethernet at GMU's Mathematics Department
originally chose thick Ethernet because it is a long route that the
cable must take so traffic will not be disrupted each time a host
is added to the network. Twisted pair installations are now very
common in a variety of installations. The Hub hardware is dropping in
price and small units are now available at a price that is attractive
to even small domestic networks. Twisted pair cabling can be
significantly cheaper for large installations, and the cable itself is
much more flexible than the coaxial cables used for the other Ethernet
systems. The network administrators in GMU's mathematics department
are planning to replace the existing network with a twisted pair
network in the coming finanical year because it will bring them up to
date with current technology and will save them significant time when
installing new host computers and moving existing computers around.</P
><P
> 
 
 
 
One of the drawbacks of Ethernet technology is its limited cable length, which
precludes any use of it other than for LANs. However, several Ethernet
segments can be linked to one another using repeaters, bridges, or routers.
Repeaters simply copy the signals between two or more segments so that all
segments together will act as if they are one Ethernet. Due to timing
requirements, there may not be more than four repeaters between any two hosts
on the network. Bridges and routers are more sophisticated. They analyze
incoming data and forward it only when the recipient host is not on the local
Ethernet.</P
><P
>&#13;
Ethernet works like a bus system, where a host may send packets (or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>frames</I
>) of up to 1,500 bytes to another host on the same
Ethernet. A host is addressed by a six-byte address hardcoded into the
firmware of its Ethernet network interface card (NIC). These addresses are
usually written as a sequence of two-digit hex numbers separated by colons,
as in <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>&#13; A
frame sent by one station is seen by all attached stations, but only
the destination host actually picks it up and processes it. If two
stations try to send at the same time, a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>collision</I
> occurs. Collisions on an Ethernet are
detected very quickly by the electronics of the interface cards and
are resolved by the two stations aborting the send, each waiting a
random interval and re-attempting the transmission. You'll hear lots
of stories about collisions on Ethernet being a problem and that
utilization of Ethernets is only about 30 percent of the available
bandwidth because of them.  Collisions on Ethernet are a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>normal</I
> phenomenon, and on a very busy Ethernet
network you shouldn't be surprised to see collision rates of up to
about 30 percent. Utilization of Ethernet networks is more
realistically limited to about 60 percent before you need to start
worrying about it.<A

><P
>In larger installations, such as Groucho Marx University, Ethernet is usually
not the only type of equipment used. There are many other data communications
protocols available and in use. All of the protocols listed are supported by
Linux, but due to space constraints we'll describe them briefly. Many of the
protocols have HOWTO documents that describe them in detail, so you should
refer to those if you're interested in exploring those that we don't describe
in this book.</P
><P
>&#13;

At Groucho Marx University, each department's LAN is linked to the
campus high-speed &#8220;backbone&#8221; network, which is a fiber
optic cable running a network technology called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Fiber
Distributed Data Interface</I
> (FDDI). FDDI uses an entirely
different approach to transmitting data, which basically involves
sending around a number of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>tokens</I
>, with a station
being allowed to send a frame only if it captures a token. The main
advantage of a token-passing protocol is a reduction in collisions.
Therefore, the protocol can more easily attain the full speed of the
transmission medium, up to 100 Mbps in the case of FDDI.  FDDI, being
based on optical fiber, offers a significant advantage because its
maximum cable length is much greater than wire-based technologies. It
has limits of up to around 200 km, which makes it ideal for linking
many buildings in a city, or as in GMU's case, many buildings on a
campus.</P
><P
>&#13;  Similarly, if there is any IBM
computing equipment around, an IBM Token Ring network is quite likely
to be installed. Token Ring is used as an alternative to Ethernet in
some LAN environments, and offers the same sorts of advantages as FDDI
in terms of achieving full wire speed, but at lower speeds (4 Mbps or
16 Mbps), and lower cost because it is based on wire rather than
fiber. In Linux, Token Ring networking is configured in almost
precisely the same way as Ethernet, so we don't cover it specifically.</P
><P
>Although it is much less likely today than in the past, other LAN
technologies, such as ArcNet and DECNet, might be installed. Linux
supports these too, but we don't cover them here.</P
><P
>&#13;
 Many national networks operated by
Telecommunications companies support packet switching
protocols. Probably the most popular of these is a standard named
X.25. Many Public Data Networks, like Tymnet in the U.S., Austpac in
Australia, and Datex-P in Germany offer this service. X.25 defines a
set of networking protocols that describes how data terminal
equipment, such as a host, communicates with data communications
equipment (an X.25 switch). X.25 requires a synchronous data link, and
therefore special synchronous serial port hardware. It is possible to
use X.25 with normal serial ports if you use a special device called a
PAD (Packet Assembler Disassembler). The PAD is a standalone device
that provides asynchronous serial ports and a synchronous serial
port. It manages the X.25 protocol so that simple terminal devices can
make and accept X.25 connections. X.25 is often used to carry other
network protocols, such as TCP/IP. Since IP datagrams cannot simply be
mapped onto X.25 (or vice versa), they are encapsulated in X.25
packets and sent over the network. There is an experimental
implementation of the X.25 protocol available for Linux.</P
><P
>&#13;
A more recent protocol commonly offered by telecommunications
companies is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Frame Relay</I
>. The Frame Relay
protocol shares a number of technical features with the X.25 protocol,
but is much more like the IP protocol in behavior. Like X.25, Frame
Relay requires special synchronous serial hardware. Because of their
similarities, many cards support both of these protocols. An
alternative is available that requires no special internal hardware,
again relying on an external device called a Frame Relay Access Device
(FRAD) to manage the encapsulation of Ethernet packets into Frame
Relay packets for transmission across a network. Frame Relay is ideal
for carrying TCP/IP between sites. Linux provides drivers that support
some types of internal Frame Relay devices.</P
><P
>&#13;
If you need higher speed networking that can carry many different
types of data, such as digitized voice and video, alongside your usual
data, ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is probably what you'll be
interested in. ATM is a new network technology that has been
specifically designed to provide a manageable, high-speed, low-latency
means of carrying data, and provide control over the Quality of
Service (Q.S.). Many telecommunications companies are deploying ATM
network infrastructure because it allows the convergence of a number
of different network services into one platform, in the hope of
achieving savings in management and support costs. ATM is often used
to carry TCP/IP.  The Networking-HOWTO offers information on the Linux
support available for ATM.</P
><P
>&#13;










Frequently, radio amateurs use their radio equipment to network their
computers; this is commonly called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>packet
radio</I
>. One of the protocols used by amateur radio operators
is called AX.25 and is loosely derived from X.25. Amateur radio
operators use the AX.25 protocol to carry TCP/IP and other protocols,
too. AX.25, like X.25, requires serial hardware capable of synchronous
operation, or an external device called a &#8220;Terminal Node
Controller&#8221; to convert packets transmitted via an asynchronous
serial link into packets transmitted synchronously. There are a
variety of different sorts of interface cards available to support
packet radio operation; these cards are generally referred to as being
&#8220;Z8530 SCC based,&#8221; and are named after the most popular
type of communications controller used in the designs. Two of the
other protocols that are commonly carried by AX.25 are the NetRom and
Rose protocols, which are network layer protocols. Since these
protocols run over AX.25, they have the same hardware
requirements. Linux supports a fully featured implementation of the
AX.25, NetRom, and Rose protocols. The AX25-HOWTO is a good source of
information on the Linux implementation of these protocols.</P
><P
>Other types of Internet access involve dialing up a central system
over slow but cheap serial lines (telephone, ISDN, and so on).  These
require yet another protocol for transmission of packets, such as SLIP
or PPP, which will be described later.</P

Of course, you wouldn't want your networking to be limited to one
Ethernet or one point-to-point data link. Ideally, you would want to
be able to communicate with a host computer regardless of what type of
physical network it is connected to. For example, in larger
installations such as Groucho Marx University, you usually have a
number of separate networks that have to be connected in some way. At
GMU, the Math department runs two Ethernets: one with fast machines
for professors and graduates, and another with slow machines for
students. Both are linked to the FDDI campus backbone network.</P
><P
>&#13;


This connection is handled by a dedicated host called a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>gateway</I
> that handles incoming and outgoing
packets by copying them between the two Ethernets and the FDDI fiber
optic cable. For example, if you are at the Math department and want
to access <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
> on the
Physics department's LAN from your Linux box, the networking software
will not send packets to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>
directly because it is not on the same Ethernet. Therefore, it has to
rely on the gateway to act as a forwarder. The gateway (named
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>sophus</SPAN
>) then forwards these
packets to its peer gateway <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>niels</SPAN
> at the Physics department, using
the backbone network, with <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>niels</SPAN
> delivering it to the destination
machine. Data flow between <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
> is shown in <A
HREF="x-087-2-intro.tcpip.html#X-087-2-INTRO.FIG.IP-FLOW"

>&#13;
This scheme of directing data to a remote host is called
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>routing</I
>, and packets are often referred to as
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>datagrams</I
> in this context. To facilitate things,
datagram exchange is governed by a single protocol that is independent
of the hardware used: IP, or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Internet Protocol</I
>.
In <A
HREF="x-087-2-issues.html"
>Chapter 2</A
>, we will cover IP and the issues of
routing in greater detail.</P
><P
>&#13;

The main benefit of IP is that it turns physically dissimilar networks into
one apparently homogeneous network. This is called internetworking, and the
resulting &#8220;meta-network&#8221; is called an
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>internet</I
>. Note the subtle difference here between
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>an</I
> internet and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>the</I
> Internet.
The latter is the official name of one particular global internet.</P
><P
>&#13;




Of course, IP also requires a hardware-independent addressing
scheme. This is achieved by assigning each host a unique 32-bit number
called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>IP address</I
>. An IP address is usually
written as four decimal numbers, one for each 8-bit portion, separated
by dots. For example, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>
might have an IP address of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>0x954C0C04</SPAN
>, which would be written as
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.12.4</SPAN
>. This format is
also called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>dotted decimal notation</I
> and sometimes
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>dotted quad notation</I
>. It is increasingly going
under the name IPv4 (for Internet Protocol, Version 4) because a new
standard called IPv6 offers much more flexible addressing, as well as
other modern features. It will be at least a year after the release of
this edition before IPv6 is in use.</P
><P
>&#13;
You will notice that we now have three different types of addresses:
first there is the host's name, like <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>, then there are IP addresses, and
finally, there are hardware addresses, like the 6-byte Ethernet
address. All these addresses somehow have to match so that when you
type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin quark</B
>, the networking software can be
given <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>'s IP address; and
when IP delivers any data to the Physics department's Ethernet, it
somehow has to find out what Ethernet address corresponds to the IP
address.</P
><P
>We will deal with these situations in <A
HREF="x-087-2-issues.html"
>Chapter 2</A
>.
For now, it's enough to remember that these steps of finding addresses are
called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>hostname resolution</I
>, for mapping hostnames onto IP
addresses, and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>address resolution</I
>, for mapping the latter
to hardware addresses.</P

>&#13;





On serial lines, a &#8220;de facto&#8221; standard exists known as SLIP, or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Serial Line IP</I
>. A modification of SLIP known as CSLIP,
or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Compressed SLIP</I
>, performs compression of IP headers
to make better use of the relatively low bandwidth provided by most serial
links. Another serial protocol is PPP, or the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Point-to-Point Protocol</I
>. PPP is more modern than
SLIP and includes a number of features that make it more attractive. Its
main advantage over SLIP is that it isn't limited to transporting IP
datagrams, but is designed to allow just about any protocol to be carried
across it.</P

Sending datagrams from one host to another is not the whole story. If you
log in to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>, you want to have a
reliable connection between your <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> process on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
> and the shell process on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>. Thus, the information sent
to and fro must be split up into packets by the sender and reassembled into
a character stream by the receiver. Trivial as it seems, this involves a
number of complicated tasks.</P
><P
>A very important thing to know about IP is that, by intent, it is not
reliable.  Assume that ten people on your Ethernet started downloading
the latest release of Netscape's web browser source code from GMU's
FTP server. The amount of traffic generated might be too much for the
gateway to handle, because it's too slow and it's tight on memory. Now
if you happen to send a packet to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>sophus</SPAN
> might be out of buffer space for a
moment and therefore unable to forward it. IP solves this problem by
simply discarding it. The packet is irrevocably lost. It is therefore
the responsibility of the communicating hosts to check the integrity
and completeness of the data and retransmit it in case of error.</P
><P
>This process is performed by yet another protocol, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Transmission
Control Protocol</I
> (TCP), which builds a reliable service on top of IP. The
essential property of TCP is that it uses IP to give you the illusion of a
simple connection between the two processes on your host and the remote
machine, so you don't have to care about how and along which route your data
actually travels.  A TCP connection works essentially like a two-way pipe that
both processes may write to and read from. Think of it as a telephone
conversation.</P
><P
>&#13;
TCP identifies the end points of such a connection by the IP addresses
of the two hosts involved and the number of a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>port</I
> on each host. Ports may be viewed as
attachment points for network connections.  If we are to strain the
telephone example a little more, and you imagine that cities are like
hosts, one might compare IP addresses to area codes (where numbers map
to cities), and port numbers to local codes (where numbers map to
individual people's telephones). An individual host may support many
different services, each distinguished by its own port number.</P
><P
>&#13;In the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B

(<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B

CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
> and connects to port 513 on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>, to which the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogind</B
> server is known to listen. This action
establishes a TCP connection. Using this connection,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogind</B
> performs the authorization procedure and
then spawns the shell. The shell's standard input and output are
redirected to the TCP connection, so that anything you type to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> on your machine will be passed through the
TCP stream and be given to the shell as standard input.</P

Of course, TCP isn't the only user protocol in TCP/IP networking. Although
suitable for applications like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>, the overhead
involved is prohibitive for applications like NFS, which instead uses a
sibling protocol of TCP called UDP, or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>User Datagram Protocol</I
>. Just like TCP, UDP allows an
application to contact a service on a certain port of the remote machine, but
it doesn't establish a connection for this. Instead, you use it to send single
packets to the destination service&#8212;hence its name.</P
><P
>Assume you want to request a small amount of data from a database
server. It takes at least three datagrams to establish a TCP
connection, another three to send and confirm a small amount of data
each way, and another three to close the connection. UDP provides us
with a means of using only two datagrams to achieve almost the same
result. UDP is said to be connectionless, and it doesn't require us to
establish and close a session. We simply put our data into a datagram
and send it to the server; the server formulates its reply, puts the
data into a datagram addressed back to us, and transmits it
back. While this is both faster and more efficient than TCP for simple
transactions, UDP was not designed to deal with datagram loss. It is
up to the application, a name server for example, to take care of
this.</P

><P
>&#13; Ports may be viewed
as attachment points for network connections. If an application wants
to offer a certain service, it attaches itself to a port and waits for
clients (this is also called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>listening</I
> on the
port). A client who wants to use this service allocates a port on its
local host and connects to the server's port on the remote host. The
same port may be open on many different machines, but on each machine
only one process can open a port at any one time.</P
><P
>An important property of ports is that once a connection has been
established between the client and the server, another copy of the
server may attach to the server port and listen for more clients.
This property permits, for instance, several concurrent remote logins
to the same host, all using the same port 513. TCP is able to tell
these connections from one another because they all come from
different ports or hosts. For example, if you log in twice to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
> from <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>, the first
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> client will use the local port 1023, and the
second one will use port 1022. Both, however, will connect to the same
port 513 on <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN
>. The two
connections will be distinguished by use of the port numbers used at
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>&#13;

This example shows the use of ports as rendezvous points, where a client
contacts a specific port to obtain a specific service. In order for a client
to know the proper port number, an agreement has to be reached between the
administrators of both systems on the assignment of these numbers. For
services that are widely used, such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>, these
numbers have to be administered centrally. This is done by the IETF
(Internet Engineering Task Force), which regularly releases an RFC titled
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Assigned Numbers</I
> (RFC-1700). It describes, among other
things, the port numbers assigned to well-known services. Linux uses a file
called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/services</TT
> that maps service names to
numbers.</P
><P
>It is worth noting that although both TCP and UDP connections rely on ports,
these numbers do not conflict. This means that TCP port 513, for example, is
different from UDP port 513. In fact, these ports serve as access points for
two different services, namely <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> (TCP) and
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rwho</B
> (UDP).

>1.2.9. The Socket Library</A
></H2
><P
> 







In Unix operating systems, the software performing all the tasks and
protocols described above is usually part of the kernel, and so it is
in Linux. The programming interface most common in the Unix world is
the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Berkeley Socket Library</I
>. Its name derives
from a popular analogy that views ports as sockets and connecting to
a port as plugging in. It provides the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>bind</TT
> call
to specify a remote host, a transport protocol, and a service that a
program can connect or listen to (using <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>connect</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>listen</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>accept</TT
>). The
socket library is somewhat more general in that it provides not only a
class of TCP/IP-based sockets (the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_INET</TT
>
sockets), but also a class that handles connections local to the
machine (the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_UNIX</TT
> class). Some implementations
can also handle other classes, like the XNS (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Xerox
Networking System</I
>) protocol or X.25.</P
><P
>&#13;










In Linux, the socket library is part of the standard
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libc</TT
> C library. It supports the
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_INET</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_INET6</TT
> sockets
for TCP/IP and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_UNIX</TT
> for Unix domain
sockets. It also supports <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_IPX</TT
> for Novell's
network protocols, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_X25</TT
> for the X.25 network
protocol, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_ATMPVC</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_ATMSVC</TT
> for the ATM network protocol and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_AX25</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_NETROM</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AF_ROSE</TT
> sockets for Amateur Radio protocol
support. Other protocol families are being developed and will be
added in time.</P
