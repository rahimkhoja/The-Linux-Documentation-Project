First, let's look at where the protocols came from and what they look
like.  In the late 1970s, the Xerox Corporation developed and
published an open standard called the Xerox Network Specification
(XNS). The Xerox Network Specification described a series of protocols
designed for general purpose internetworking, with a strong emphasis
on the use of local area networks. There were two primary networking
protocols involved: the Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP), which
provided a connectionless and unreliable transport of datagrams from
one host to another, and the Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP), which
was a modified form of IDP that was connection-based and reliable. The
datagrams of an XNS network were individually addressed. The
addressing scheme used a combination of a 4-byte IDP network
address (which was uniquely assigned to each Ethernet LAN segment),
and the 6-byte node address (the address of the NIC card).  Routers
were devices that switched datagrams between two or more separate IDP
networks. IDP has no notion of subnetworks; any new collection of
hosts requires another network address to be assigned. Network
addresses are chosen such that they are unique on the internetwork in
question. Sometimes administrators develop conventions by having each
byte encode some other information, such as geographic location, so that
network addresses are allocated in a systemic way; it isn't a
protocol requirement, however.</P

The Novell Corporation chose to base their own networking suite on the
XNS suite. Novell made small enhancements to IDP and SPP and renamed
them IPX (Internet Packet eXchange) and SPX (Sequenced Packet
eXchange).  Novell added new protocols, such as the NetWare Core
Protocol (NCP), which provided file and printer sharing features that
ran over IPX, and the Service Advertisement Protocol (SAP), which
enabled hosts on a Novell network to know which hosts provided which
services.</P

the XNS, Novell, and TCP/IP suites in terms of function. The relationships
are an approximation only, but should help you understand what is
happening when we refer to these protocols later on.</P
