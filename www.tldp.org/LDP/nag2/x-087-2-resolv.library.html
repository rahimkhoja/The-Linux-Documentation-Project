>The term <I

application, but to the resolver library. This is a collection of
functions that can be found in the standard C library. The central
routines are <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gethostbyname(2)</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gethostbyaddr&#8201;(2)</TT
>, which look up all IP addresses
associated with a host name, and vice versa. They may be configured to
simply look up the information in <TT

a number of DNS name servers, or to use the <I

>
database of Network Information Service (NIS).</P
><P
>The resolver functions read configuration files when they are
invoked. From these configuration files, they determine what databases
to query, in which order, and other details relevant to how you've
configured your environment.  The older Linux standard library, libc,
used <TT

file, but Version 2 of the GNU standard library, glibc, uses
<TT

>6.1.3. Configuring Name Server Lookups Using resolv.conf</A
></H2
><P
>When configuring the resolver library to use the BIND name service for host
lookups, you also have to tell it which name servers to use. There is a
separate file for this called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>resolv.conf</TT
>. If this file
does not exist or is empty, the resolver assumes the name server is on your
local host.</P
><P
>To run a name server on your local host, you have to set it up separately,
as will be explained in the following section. If you are on a local network
and have the opportunity to use an existing name server, this should always
be preferred. If you use a dialup IP connection to the Internet, you
would normally specify the name server of your service provider in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>resolv.conf</TT
> file.</P
><P
>The most important option in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>resolv.conf</TT
> is
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>name server</SPAN
>, which gives the IP address
of a name server to use. If you specify several name servers by giving the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>name server</SPAN
> option several times, they
are tried in the order given. You should therefore put the most reliable
server first. The current implementation allows you to have up to three
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>name server</SPAN
> statements in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>resolv.conf</TT
>. If no
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>name server</SPAN
> option is given, the resolver
attempts to connect to the name server on the local host.</P
><P
>&#13;
Two other options, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>domain</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>search</SPAN
>, let you use shortcut names
for hosts in your local domain. Usually, when just telnetting to another
host in your local domain, you don't want to type in the fully qualified
hostname, but use a name like <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>gauss</SPAN
> 
on the command line and have the resolver tack on the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>mathematics.groucho.edu</SPAN
> part.</P
><P
>This is just the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>domain</SPAN
>
statement's purpose. It lets you specify a default domain name to be
appended when DNS fails to look up a hostname. For instance, when
given the name <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>gauss</SPAN
>, the
resolver fails to find <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>gauss.</SPAN
> in DNS, because there is no such
top-level domain. When given <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>mathematics.groucho.edu</SPAN
> as a default
domain, the resolver repeats the query for <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>gauss</SPAN
> with the default domain appended,
this time succeeding.</P
><P
>That's just fine, you may think, but as soon you get out of the Math
department's domain, you're back to those fully qualified domain names.
Of course, you would also want to have shorthands like
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark.physics</SPAN
> for hosts in the
Physics department's domain.</P
><P
>This is when the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>search list</I
> comes in.  A search
list can be specified using the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>search</SPAN
> option, which is a generalization
of the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>domain</SPAN
> statement.
Where the latter gives a single default domain, the former specifies a
whole list of them, each to be tried in turn until a lookup
succeeds. This list must be separated by blanks or tabs.</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>search</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>domain</SPAN
> statements are mutually exclusive
and may not appear more than once. If neither option is given, the resolver
will try to guess the default domain from the local hostname using the
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>getdomainname(2)</TT
> system call. If the local hostname
doesn't have a domain part, the default domain will be assumed to be the
root domain.</P
><P
>If you decide to put a <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>search</SPAN
> statement
into <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>resolv.conf</TT
>, you should be careful about what
domains you add to this list. Resolver libraries prior to BIND 4.9 used to
construct a default search list from the domain name when no search list was
given. This default list was made up of the default domain itself, plus all
of its parent domains up to the root. This caused some problems because DNS
requests wound up at name servers that were never meant to see them.</P
><P
>Assume you're at the Virtual Brewery and want to log in to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>foot.groucho.edu</SPAN
>. By a slip
of your fingers, you mistype <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>foot</SPAN
> as <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>foo</SPAN
>, which doesn't exist. GMU's name
server will therefore tell you that it knows no such host. With the
old-style search list, the resolver would now go on trying the name
with <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vbrew.com</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>com</SPAN
> appended. The latter is
problematic because <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu.com</SPAN
> might actually be a valid
domain name.  Their name server might then even find <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>foo</SPAN
> in their domain, pointing you to one
of their hosts&#8212;which clearly was not intended.</P
><P
>For some applications, these bogus host lookups can be a security problem.
Therefore, you should usually limit the domains on your search list to your
local organization, or something comparable. At the Mathematics department of
Groucho Marx University, the search list would commonly be set to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>maths.groucho.edu</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN

>When running a LAN inside a larger network, you definitely should use
central name servers if they are available. The name servers develop
rich caches that speed up repeat queries, since all queries are
forwarded to them. However, this scheme has a drawback: when a fire
destroyed the backbone cable at Olaf's university, no more work was
possible on his department's LAN because the resolver could no longer
reach any of the name servers. This situation caused difficulties with
most network services, such as X terminal logins and printing.</P
><P
>Although it is not very common for campus backbones to go down in flames,
one might want to take precautions against cases like this.</P
><P
>One option is to set up a local name server that resolves hostnames from your
local domain and forwards all queries for other hostnames to the main servers.
Of course, this is applicable only if you are running your own domain.</P
><P
>Alternatively, you can maintain a backup host table for your domain or LAN in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
>. This is very simple to do. You simply ensure
that the resolver library queries DNS first, and the hosts file next. In an
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/host.conf</TT
> file you'd use
&#8220;<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>order bind,hosts</SPAN
>&#8221;,
and in an <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT
> file you'd use
&#8220;<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>hosts: dns files</SPAN
>&#8221;,
to make the resolver fall back to the hosts file if the central name server is
unreachable.
