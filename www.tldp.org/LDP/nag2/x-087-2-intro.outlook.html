>7. Overview</A
></H1
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-intro.html"
>Chapter 1</A
>, discusses the history of Linux and
covers basic networking information on UUCP, TCP/IP, various
protocols, hardware, and security. The next few chapters deal with
configuring Linux for TCP/IP networking and running some major
applications. We examine IP a little more closely in <A
HREF="x-087-2-issues.html"
>Chapter 2</A
>, before getting our hands dirty with file
editing and the like. If you already know how IP routing works and how
address resolution is performed, you can skip this chapter.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-hardware.html"
>Chapter 3</A
>, deals with very basic configuration issues,
such as building a kernel and setting up your Ethernet card. The
configuration of your serial ports is covered separately in
<A
HREF="x-087-2-serial.html"
>Chapter 4</A
>, because the discussion does not apply
to TCP/IP networking only, but is also relevant for UUCP.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-iface.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>, helps you set up your machine for TCP/IP
networking.  It contains installation hints for standalone hosts with
loopback enabled only, and hosts connected to an Ethernet.  It also
introduces you to a few useful tools you can use to test and debug your
setup. <A
HREF="x-087-2-resolv.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>, discusses how to configure hostname
resolution and explains how to set up a name server.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-slip.html"
>Chapter 7</A
>, explains how to establish SLIP connections
and gives a detailed reference for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dip</B
>, a tool that
allows you to automate most of the necessary steps.
<A
HREF="x-087-2-ppp.html"
>Chapter 8</A
>, covers PPP and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pppd</B
>,
the PPP daemon.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.html"
>Chapter 9</A
>, extends our discussion on network
security and describes the Linux TCP/IP firewall and its configuration
tools: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
>, and
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>iptables</B
>. IP firewalling provides a means of
controlling who can access your network and hosts very precisely.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-accounting.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>, explains how to configure IP Accounting
in Linux so you can keep track of how much traffic is going where and who is
generating it.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-ipmasq.html"
>Chapter 11</A
>, covers a feature of the Linux
networking software called IP masquerade, which allows whole IP
networks to connect to and use the Internet through a single IP
address, hiding internal systems from outsiders in the process.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-appl.html"
>Chapter 12</A
>, gives a short introduction to setting up some
of the most important network applications, such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>, etc. This chapter also covers how services are managed
by the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inetd</B
> superuser, and how you may restrict certain
security-relevant services to a set of trusted hosts.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-nis.html"
>Chapter 13</A
>, and <A
HREF="x-087-2-nfs.html"
>Chapter 14</A
>,
discuss NIS and NFS. NIS is a tool used to distribute administative
information, such as user passwords in a local area network. NFS
allows you to share filesystems between several hosts in your network.</P
><P
>In <A
HREF="x-087-2-ipx.html"
>Chapter 15</A
>, we discuss the IPX protocol and the NCP
filesystem. These allow Linux to be integrated into a Novell NetWare
environment, sharing files and printers with non-Linux machines.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-uucp.html"
>Chapter 16</A
>, gives you an extensive introduction to the
administration of Taylor UUCP, a free implementation of the UUCP suite.</P
><P
>The remainder of the book is taken up by a detailed tour of electronic
mail and Usenet news. <A
HREF="x-087-2-mail.html"
>Chapter 17</A
>, introduces you to the
central concepts of electronic mail, like what a mail address looks like, and
how the mail handling system manages to get your message to the
recipient.</P
><P
><A
HREF="x-087-2-sendmail.html"
>Chapter 18</A
>, and <A
HREF="x-087-2-exim.html"
>Chapter 19</A
>, cover 
the configuration of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exim</B
>, 
two mail transport agents you can use for Linux.  This book explains both 
of them, because <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exim</B
> is easier to install for the 
beginner, while <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> provides support for UUCP.</P
><P
>&#13;<A
HREF="x-087-2-news.html"
>Chapter 20</A
>, through <A
HREF="x-087-2-inn.html"
>Chapter 23</A
>,
explain the way news is managed in Usenet and how you install and use
C News, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nntpd</B
>, and INN: three popular software
packages for managing Usenet news. After the brief introduction in
<A
HREF="x-087-2-news.html"
>Chapter 20</A
>, you can read <A
HREF="x-087-2-cnews.html"
>Chapter 21</A
>, if you want to transfer news using C News, a
traditional service generally used with UUCP. The following chapters
discuss more modern alternatives to C News that use the Internet-based
protocol NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol).  <A
HREF="x-087-2-nntp.html"
>Chapter 22</A
> covers how to set up a simple NNTP daemon,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nntpd</B
>, to provide news reading access for a local
network, while <A
HREF="x-087-2-inn.html"
>Chapter 23</A
> describes a more robust
server for more extensive NetNews transfers, the InterNet News daemon
(INN).  And finally, <A
HREF="x-087-2-newsreaders.html"
>Chapter 24</A
>, shows you
how to configure and maintain various newsreaders.</P
