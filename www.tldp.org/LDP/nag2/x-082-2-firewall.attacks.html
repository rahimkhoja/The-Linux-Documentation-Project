>9.1. Methods of Attack</A
></H1
><P
>&#13;
As a network administrator, it is important that you understand the nature of
potential attacks on computer security. We'll briefly
describe the most important types of attacks so that you can better understand
precisely what the Linux IP firewall will protect you against. You should do
some additional reading to ensure that you are able to protect your
network against other types of attacks. Here
are some of the more important methods of attack and ways of protecting
yourself against them:</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Unauthorized access</DT
><DD
><P
>This simply means that people who shouldn't use your computer services are
able to connect and
use them. For example, people outside your company might try to
connect to your company accounting machine or to your NFS server.</P
><P
>There are various ways to avoid this attack by carefully specifying who
can gain access through these services. You can prevent network access
to all except the intended users.</P
></DD
><DT
>Exploitation of known weaknesses in programs</DT
><DD
><P
>Some programs and network services were not originally designed with strong
security in mind and are inherently vulnerable to attack. The BSD remote
services (rlogin, rexec, etc.) are an example.</P
><P
>The best way to protect yourself against this type of attack is to disable
any vulnerable services or find alternatives. With Open Source, it is
sometimes possible to repair the weaknesses in the software.</P
></DD
><DT
>Denial of service</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;Denial of service attacks cause the service or program to cease functioning or
prevent others from making use of the service or program. These may be
performed at the network layer by sending carefully crafted and malicious
datagrams that cause network connections to fail. They may also be performed
at the application layer, where carefully crafted application commands are
given to a program that cause it to become extremely busy or stop functioning.</P
><P
>Preventing suspicious network traffic from reaching your hosts and preventing
suspicious program commands and requests are the best ways of minimizing the
risk of a denial of service attack. It's useful to know the details of the 
attack method, so you should educate yourself about each new attack as it 
gets publicized.</P
></DD
><DT
>Spoofing</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;This type of attack causes a host or application to mimic the
actions of another. Typically the attacker pretends to be an innocent host
by following IP addresses in network packets. For example, a
well-documented exploit of the BSD rlogin service can use this method to mimic a
TCP connection from another host by guessing TCP sequence numbers.</P
><P
>To protect against this type of attack, verify the authenticity of datagrams
and commands. Prevent datagram routing with invalid source addresses.
Introduce unpredictablility into connection control mechanisms, such as TCP
sequence numbers and the allocation of dynamic port addresses.</P
></DD
><DT
>Eavesdropping</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;This is the simplest type of attack. A host is configured to "listen" to and
capture data not belonging to it. Carefully written eavesdropping programs
can take usernames and passwords from user login network connections.
Broadcast networks like Ethernet are especially vulnerable to this type of
attack.</P
><P
>To protect against this type of threat, avoid use of broadcast
network technologies and enforce the use of data encryption.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
><P
>IP firewalling is very useful in preventing or reducing unauthorized access,
network layer denial of service, and IP spoofing attacks. It not very useful
in avoiding exploitation of weaknesses in network services or programs and
eavesdropping. </P
