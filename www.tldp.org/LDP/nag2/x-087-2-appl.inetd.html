>Programs that provide application services via the network are called
network <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>daemons</I
>. A daemon is a program that opens a
port, most commonly a well-known service port, and waits for incoming
connections on it. If one occurs, the daemon creates a child process that 
accepts the connection, while the parent continues to listen for further
requests. This mechanism works well, but has a few disadvantages; at
least one instance of every possible service you wish to provide must be
active in memory at all times. In addition, the software routines that 
do the listening and port handling must be replicated in every network daemon.</P
><P
>To overcome these inefficiencies, most Unix installations run a special
network daemon, what you might consider a &#8220;super server.&#8221; This
daemon creates sockets on behalf of a number of services and listens on
all of them simultaneously. When an incoming connection is received on
any of these sockets, the super server accepts the connection and spawns
the server specified for this port, passing the socket across to the child
to manage. The server then returns to listening.</P
><P
>&#13;

The most common super server is called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inetd</B
>,
the Internet Daemon. It is started at system boot time and takes the list
of services it is to manage from a startup file named
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/inetd.conf</TT
>. In addition to those servers,
there are a number of trivial services performed by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inetd</B
>
itself called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>internal services</I
>. They include
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>chargen</B
>, which simply generates a string of characters,
and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>daytime</B
>, which returns the system's idea of the time
of day.</P

><P
>This is useful for &#8220;single-threaded&#8221; servers that read all
incoming datagrams until no more arrive, and then exit. Most RPC servers
are of this type and should therefore specify
<SPAN

&#8220;multi-threaded&#8221; servers, allow an unlimited number of
instances to run concurrently. These servers should specify
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>nowait</SPAN

user, but some services may use different accounts. It is a very good idea to
apply the principle of least privilege here, which states that you shouldn't
run a command under a privileged account if the program doesn't require this for
proper functioning. For example, the NNTP news server runs as
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN

a security risk (such as <B

The <B

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tftp</B
> implements the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Trivial File Transfer
Protocol</I
> (TFTP), which allows someone to transfer any
world-readable files from your system without password checking.
This is especially harmful with the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
> file, and even more so when you don't use shadow passwords.</P
><P
>TFTP is commonly used by diskless clients and Xterminals to download their
code from a boot server. If you need to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tftpd</B
> for this
reason, make sure to limit its scope to those directories from which clients 
will retrieve files; you will need to add those directory names to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tftpd</B
>'s command line. This is shown in the second
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tftp</B
> line in the example.
