>14.5. NTP - Network Time Protocol</H1
><P
> A networked computer (even if just over a modem) can
        check its own clock automatically by comparing it to the time
        on another computer known to keep accurate time.  Network Time 
	Protocol (or NTP) does exactly that. It is a method of verifying 
	and correcting your computer's time by synchronizing it with a 
	another system. With NTP your system's time can be maintained 
	to within milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time.  Visit

> for more info.

> For more casual Linux users, this is just a nice luxury.  
	At my home all our clocks are set based upon what my Linux system 
	says the time is.  For larger organizations this "luxury" can 
	become essential.  Being able to search log files for events based 
	upon time can make life a lot easier and take a lot of the "guess work"
	out of debugging.
	</P
><P
> Another example of how important NTP can be is with a SAN.  
	Some SAN's require NTP be configured and running properly to allow 
	for proper synchronization over filesystem usage, and proper 
	timestamp control.  Some SANs (and some applications) can become 
	confused when dealing with files that have timestamps that are in 
	the future.
	</P
><P
> Most Linux distributions come with a NTP package of some kind,
	either a .deb or .rpm package.  You can use that to install NTP, or you 
	can download the source files from <A
HREF="http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html"
TARGET="_top"
>	http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html</A
> and compile it yourself.  Either way, 
	the basic configuration is the same.</P
