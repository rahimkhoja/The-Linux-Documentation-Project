            This means that applications do not need to know about what kind

            framebuffer driver's API (Application Programming Interface)
            which is well defined and standardized.  The framebuffer is a

             are the master and slave devices
            on the secondary controller respectively.  Each disk is divided
            into partitions. Partitions 1-4 are primary partitions and
            partitions 5 and above are logical partitions inside extended
            partitions.  Therefore the device file which references each
            partition is made up of several parts.  For example
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdc9</TT
> references partition 9 (a logical
            partition inside an extended partition type) on the master IDE
            drive on the secondary IDE controller.  The major and minor node
            numbers are somewhat complex.  For the first IDE controller all
            partitions are block devices on major node 3.  The master drive
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hda</TT
> is at minor 0 and the 
            slave drive <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hdb</TT
> is at minor 64.  For 
            each partition inside the drive add the partition number to the minor 
            minor node number for the drive.  For example
            <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb5</TT
> is major 3, minor 69 (64 + 5 =
            69). Drives on the secondary interface are handled the same way,
            but with major node 22.</P

>The first loopback device.  Loopback devices are

            block devices such as disks.  For example if you wish to mount
            an iso9660 CD ROM image without burning it to CD then you need
            to use a loopback device to do so.  This is usually transparent
            to the user and is handled by the <B

>mount</B

            command.  Refer to the manual pages for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount</B
>
            and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

            The loopback devices are block

            entropy to use then it must wait until it has collected more
            before it will allow any more numbers to be read from it.
