>5.2. Hard disks</H1
><P
>This subsection introduces terminology related to hard
	disks.	If you already know the terms and concepts, you can skip
	this subsection.</P
><P
>See <A
HREF="hard-disk.html#HD-SCHEMATIC"
>Figure 5-1</A
> for a schematic picture
	of the important parts in a hard disk.	A hard disk consists of one
	or more circular aluminum <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>platters</I
>\
	,
	of which either or both <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>surfaces</I
> are coated
	with a magnetic substance used for recording the data.	For each
	surface, there is a <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>read-write head</I
> that
	examines or alters the recorded data.  The platters rotate on a
	common axis; typical rotation speed is 5400 or 7200 rotations per
	minute, although high-performance hard disks have higher speeds and
	older disks may have lower speeds. The heads move along the radius
	of the platters; this movement combined with the rotation of the
	platters allows the head to access all parts of the surfaces.</P
><P
>The processor (CPU) and the actual disk communicate through a
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>disk controller</I
>
	.  This relieves the rest of
	the computer from knowing how to use the drive, since the
	controllers for different types of disks can be made to use the same
	interface towards the rest of the computer.  Therefore, the computer
	can say just ``hey disk, give me what I want'', instead of a long
	and complex series of electric signals to move the head to the
	proper location and waiting for the correct position to come under
	the head and doing all the other unpleasant stuff necessary. (In
	reality, the interface to the controller is still complex, but much
	less so than it would otherwise be.) The controller may also do
	other things, such as caching, or automatic bad sector 
	replacement.</P
><P
>The above is usually all one needs to understand about the
	hardware.  There are also other things, such as the motor that
	rotates the platters and moves the heads, and the electronics that
	control the operation of the mechanical parts, but they are mostly
	not relevant for understanding the working principles of a hard 
	disk.</P
><P
>The surfaces are usually divided into concentric rings,
	called <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>tracks</I
>, and these in turn are divided
	into <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>sectors</I
>.  This division is used to
	specify locations on the hard disk and to allocate disk space to
	files.  To find a given place on the hard disk, one might say
	``surface 3, track 5, sector 7''.  Usually the number of sectors is
	the same for all tracks, but some hard disks put more sectors in
	outer tracks (all sectors are of the same physical size, so more of
	them fit in the longer outer tracks). Typically, a sector will hold
	512 bytes of data.  The disk itself
	can't handle smaller amounts of data than one sector.</P

>Each surface is divided into tracks (and sectors) in
	the same way.  This means that when the head for one surface is on a
	track, the heads for the other surfaces are also on the
	corresponding tracks.  All the corresponding tracks taken together
	are called a <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>cylinder</I
>.	It takes time to
	move the heads from one track (cylinder) to another, so by placing
	the data that is often accessed together (say, a file) so that it is
	within one cylinder, it is not necessary to move the heads to read
	all of it.  This improves performance. It is not always possible to
	place files like this; files that are stored in several places on
	the disk are called
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>fragmented</I
>.</P
><P
>The number of surfaces (or heads, which is the same thing),
	cylinders, and sectors vary a lot; the specification of the number
	of each is called the <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>geometry</I
> of a hard
	disk.  The geometry is usually stored in a special, battery-powered
	memory location called the <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>CMOS RAM</I
>
	, from
	where the operating system can fetch it during bootup or driver 
	initialization.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, the BIOS
	has a design limitation, which makes it impossible to specify a
	track number that is larger than 1024 in the CMOS RAM, which is too
	little for a large hard disk.  To overcome this, the hard disk
	controller lies about the geometry, and <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>translates the
	addresses</I
> given by the computer into something that fits
	reality.  For example, a hard disk might have 8 heads, 2048 tracks,
	and 35 sectors per track.
	Its controller could lie to the computer and claim that it has 16
	heads, 1024 tracks, and 35 sectors per track, thus not exceeding the
	limit on tracks, and translates the address that the computer gives
	it by halving the head number, and doubling the track number.  The
	mathematics can be more complicated in reality, because the numbers
	are not as nice as here (but again, the details are not relevant for
	understanding the principle). This translation distorts the
	operating system's view of how the disk is organized, thus making it
	impractical to use the all-data-on-one-cylinder trick to boost 
	performance.</P
><P
>The translation is only a problem for IDE disks.	SCSI disks
	use a sequential sector number (i.e., the controller translates a
	sequential sector number to a head, cylinder, and sector triplet),
	and a completely different method for the CPU to talk with the
	controller, so they are insulated from the problem. Note, however,
	that the computer might not know the real geometry of an SCSI disk 
	either.</P
><P
>Since Linux often will not know the real geometry of a disk,
	its filesystems don't even try to keep files within a single
	cylinder.  Instead, it tries to assign sequentially numbered sectors
	to files, which almost always gives similar performance. The issue
	is further complicated by on-controller caches, and automatic 
	prefetches done by the controller.</P
><P
>Each hard disk is represented by a separate device
	file.  There can (usually) be only two or four IDE hard disks. These
	are known as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hda</TT
>,
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdb</TT
>, 
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdc</TT
>, and
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdd</TT
>, 
	respectively.  SCSI hard disks are
	known as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sda</TT
>,
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/sdb</TT
>, and so on.  Similar naming
	conventions exist for other hard disk types; see <A
HREF="device-list.html"
>Chapter 4</A
> for more information.  Note that the device
	files for the hard disks give access to the entire disk, with no
	regard to partitions (which will be discussed below), and it's easy
	to mess up the partitions or the data in them if you aren't careful.
	The disks' device files are usually used only to get access to the
	master boot record (which will also be discussed below).</P
