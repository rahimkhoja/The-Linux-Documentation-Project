CLASS="COMMAND"
>init</B
>
	is started as the first process of every UNIX system, as the last
	thing the kernel does when it boots.  When <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>init</B
>
	starts, it continues the boot process by doing various startup
	chores (checking and mounting filesystems, starting daemons,
	etc).</P
><P
>The exact list of things that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>init</B
>
	does depends on which flavor it is; there are several to choose
	from.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>init</B
> usually provides the concept of
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>single user mode</I
>, in which no one can
	log in and root uses a shell at the console; the usual mode is
	called <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>multiuser mode</I
>.  Some flavors
	generalize this as <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>run levels</I
>; single
	and multiuser modes are considered to be two run levels, and
	there can be additional ones as well, for example, to run X on
	the console.</P
><P
>Linux allows for up to 10
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>runlevels</I
>, 0-9, but usually only some of
	these are defined by default.  Runlevel 0 is defined as ``system
	halt''.  Runlevel 1 is defined as ``single user mode''.  Runlevel 3 
	 is defined as
	"multi user" because it is the runlevel that the system boot into
	under normal day to day conditions.  Runlevel 5 is typically the same as 3 except that a GUI 
	 
	gets started also.
	Runlevel 6 is defined as ``system 
	reboot''.  Other runlevels are
	dependent on how your particular distribution has defined them,
	and they vary significantly between distributions.  Looking at 
	the contents of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/inittab</TT
> 
	
	usually will 
	give some hint what the predefined runlevels are and what they
	have been defined as.</P

	be in a single tree, so orphans must be adopted).</P
><P
>When the system is shut down, it is <B

	program.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

	<B

	the shell. When the shell terminates, i.e., the user logs out, or
	when <B

	password didn't match, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

	produce error, warning, and other messages.  It is often important
	that these messages can be viewed later, even much later, so they
	should be written to a file.  The program doing this is
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>syslog</B
> .  It can be configured to sort the
	messages to different files according to writer or degree of
	importance.  For example, kernel messages are often directed to a
	separate file from the others, since kernel messages are often more
	important and need to be read
	regularly to spot problems.</P

>Both users and system administrators often need

	Each user can have a <TT

>2.3.5. Graphical user interface</H2
><P
>&#13;	UNIX and Linux don't incorporate the user interface
	into the kernel; instead, they let it be implemented by user level
	programs.  This applies for both text mode and graphical
	environments.</P
><P
>This arrangement makes the system more flexible, but has
	the disadvantage that it is simple to implement a different user
	interface for each program, making the system harder to
	learn.</P
><P
>The graphical environment primarily used with Linux
	is called the X Window System  (X for short).  
	X also does not implement a user interface; it only implements a 
	window system, i.e., tools with which a graphical user interface can
	be implemented.  Some popular window managers are: fvwm , icewm
	, blackbox , and windowmaker 
	. There are also two popular desktop managers,
	KDE  and Gnome.

><P
>Networking is the act of connecting two or more computers
	so that they can communicate with each other.  The actual methods
	of connecting and communicating are slightly complicated, but
	the end result is very useful.</P
><P
>UNIX operating systems have many networking features.
	Most basic services (filesystems, printing, backups, etc) can
	be done over the network.  This can make system administration
	easier, since it allows centralized administration, while
	still reaping in the benefits of microcomputing and distributed
	computing, such as lower costs and better fault tolerance.</P

>2.3.7. Network logins</H2
><P
>Network logins work a little differently 
	than normal logins.  For each person logging in via the network
	there is a separate virtual network connection, 
	and there can be any number of these depending on the available 
	bandwidth.  It is therefore not possible to run a separate
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>getty</B
> for each possible virtual connection.
	There are also several different ways to log in via a network,
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
	 being
	the major ones in TCP/IP networks.</P
><P
>These days many Linux system administrators consider
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
> to be 
	insecure and prefer <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>, the ``secure shell'', 
	which encrypts traffic going over the network, thereby making it far 
	less likely that the malicious can ``sniff'' your connection and gain 
	sensitive data like usernames and passwords.  It is highly recommended 
	you use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
> rather than <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
> 
	or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rlogin</B
>.</P
><P
>Network logins have, instead of a herd 
	of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>getty</B
>s, a single daemon per way 
	of logging in
	(<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh</B
>
	 have
	separate daemons) that listens for all incoming login attempts.
	When it notices one, it starts a new instance of itself to
	handle that single attempt; the original instance continues to
	listen for other attempts.  The new instance works similarly
	to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>getty</B
>.</P

NAME="NFS"

>2.3.8. Network file systems</H2
><P
>One of the more useful things that can be done with
	networking services is sharing files via a <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>network
	file system</I
>.  Depending on your network this could 
	be done over the Network File System (NFS), or over 
	the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
	NFS is typically a 'UNIX' based service.  In Linux, NFS is supported
	by the kernel.  CIFS however is not.  In Linux,
	CIFS is supported by Samba <A

	</P
><P
>With a network file system any file operations done by
	a program on one machine are sent over the network to another
	computer.  This fools the program to think that all the files
	on the other computer are actually on the computer the program
	is running on.	This makes information sharing extremely simple,
	since it requires no modifications to programs.</P

NAME="MAIL"

>2.3.9. Mail</H2
><P
>Electronic mail is the most popularly used method for
	communicating via computer.  An electronic letter is stored in a
	file using a special format, and special mail programs are used
	to send and read the letters.</P
><P
>Each user has an <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>incoming mailbox</I
>
	(a file in the special format), where all new mail is stored.
	When someone sends mail, the mail program locates the receiver's
	mailbox and appends the letter to the mailbox file.  If the
	receiver's mailbox is in another machine, the letter is sent to
	the other machine, which delivers it to the mailbox as it best
	sees fit.</P
><P
>The mail system consists of many programs.  The
	delivery of mail to local or remote mailboxes is done by one
	program (the <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>mail transfer agent</I
> (MTA)
	, e.g., <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
>
	
	or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postfix</B
>
	), while the programs users use are many and varied
	(<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>mail user agent</I
> (MUA)
	, e.g., <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pine</B
>
	, or 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>evolution</B
>
	.	
	The mailboxes are usually stored
	in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/mail</TT

	retrieves them.</P

NAME="PRINTING"
></A
>2.3.10. Printing</H2
><P
>Only one person can use a printer at one time, but it is
	uneconomical not to share printers between users.  The printer is
	therefore managed by software that implements a <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>print
	queue</I
>: all print 
	jobs are put into a queue and 
	whenever the printer is done with one job, the next one is sent
	to it automatically.  This relieves the users from organizing
	the print queue and fighting over control of the printer.
	Instead, they form a new queue <EM
>at</EM
> 
	the printer, waiting for their printouts, since no one ever seems to
	be able to get the queue software to know exactly when anyone's printout 
	is really finished.  This is a great boost to intra-office social 
	relations.</P
><P
>The print queue software also <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>spools</I
>
	 the printouts on 
	disk, i.e., the text is kept in a file while
	the job is in the queue.  This allows an application program
	to spit out the print jobs quickly to the print queue software;
	the application does not have to wait until the job is actually
	printed to continue.  This is really convenient, since it
	allows one to print out one version, and not have to wait for
	it to be printed before one can make a completely revised new
	version.</P
