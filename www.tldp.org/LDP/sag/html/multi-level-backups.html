>12.5. Multilevel backups</H1
><P
> The simple backup method outlined in the previous section
	is often quite adequate for personal use or small sites.  For more
	heavy duty use, multilevel backups are more appropriate.  </P
><P
> The simple method has two backup levels: full and
	incremental backups.  This can be generalized to any number of
	levels.  A full backup would be level 0, and the different levels
	of incremental backups levels 1, 2, 3, etc.  At each incremental
	backup level you back up everything that has changed since the
	previous backup at the same or a previous level.  </P
><P
> The purpose for doing this is that it allows a longer
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>backup history</I
> cheaply.	In the example in
	the previous section, the backup history went back to the previous
	full backup.  This could be extended by having more tapes, but
	only a week per new tape, which might be too expensive.  A longer
	backup history is useful, since deleted or corrupted files are
	often not noticed for a long time.  Even a version of a file that
	is not very up to date is better than no file at all.  </P
><P
> With multiple levels the backup history can be extended
	more cheaply.  For example, if we buy ten tapes, we could use
	tapes 1 and 2 for monthly backups (first Friday each month),
	tapes 3 to 6 for weekly backups (other Fridays; note that there
	can be five Fridays in one month, so we need four more tapes),
	and tapes 7 to 10 for daily backups (Monday to Thursday).
	With only four more tapes, we've been able to extend the backup
	history from two weeks (after all daily tapes have been used)
	to two months.	It is true that we can't restore every version
	of each file during those two months, but what we can restore
	is often good enough.  </P

	level is used each day, and which backups can be restored from

> Backup levels can also be used to keep filesystem
	restoration time to a minimum.	If you have many incremental
	backups with monotonously growing level numbers, you need to
	restore all of them if you need to rebuild the whole filesystem.
	Instead you can use level numbers that aren't monotonous, and
	keep down the number of backups to restore.  </P
><P
> To minimize the number of tapes needed to restore, you
	could use a smaller level for each incremental tape.  However,
	then the time to make the backups increases (each backup copies
	everything since the previous full backup).  A better scheme is
	suggested by the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dump</B
> manual page and described
	by the table XX (efficient-backup-levels).  Use the following
	succession of backup levels: 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 9, etc.
	This keeps both the backup and restore times low.  The most you
	have to backup is two day's worth of work.  The number of tapes
	for a restore depends on how long you keep between full backups,
	but it is less than in the simple schemes.  </P
