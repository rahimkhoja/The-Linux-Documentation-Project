>	This guide cannot teach you everything about Linux.  There
	just isn't enough space.  It is almost inevitable that at some point
	you will find something you need to do, that isn't covered in
	this (or any other) document at the LDP.
	</P

>	One of the nicest things about Linux is the large number of forums
	devoted to it.  There are forums relating to almost all facets of
	Linux ranging from newbie FAQs to in depth kernel development issues. 
 
	To receive the most from them, there are a few things you can do.

>18.1.1. Finding The Right Forum</H2
><P
>	The first thing to do is to find an appropriate forum.  There are many
	newsgroups and mailing lists devoted to Linux, so try to find and use 
	the one which most closely matches your question.  For example, there
	isn't much point in you asking a question about sendmail in a forum
	devoted to Linux kernel development.  At best the people there will 
	think you are stupid and you will get few responses, at worst you may 
	receive lots of highly insulting replies (flames). A quick look
	through the newsgroups available finds comp.mail.sendmail, which
	looks like an appropriate place to ask a sendmail question.  Your news
	client probably has a list of the newsgroups available to you, but if
	not then a full list of newsgroups is available at <A
HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?group=*"

>18.1.2. Before You Post</H2
><P
>	Now that you have found your appropriate forum, you may think you are 
	ready to post your question.  Stop. You aren't ready yet.  Have you already
	looked for the answer yourself?  There are a huge number of HOWTOs and
	FAQs available, if any of them relate to the thing you are having a
	problem with then <EM
>read them first</EM
>.  Even if they 
	don't contain the answer to your problem, what they will do is give you a
	better understanding of the subject area, and that understanding will 
	allow you to ask a more informed and sensible question.  There are also archives
	of newsgroups and mailing lists and it is entirely possible that your
	question has been asked and answered previously.  <A
HREF="http://www.google.com"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.google.com</A
> or a similar
	search engine should be something you try <EM
>before</EM
>
	posting a question.

>18.1.3. Writing Your Post</H2
><P
>Okay, you have found your appropriate forum, you have read the
	relevant HOWTOs and FAQs, you have searched the web, but you still 
	have not found the answer you need.  Now you can start writing your post.
	It is always a good idea to make it clear that you already have read 
	up on the subject by saying something like ``I have read the 
	Winmodem-HOWTO and the PPP FAQ, but neither contained what I was looking for,
	searching for `Winmodem Linux PPP Setup' on google didn't return 
	anything of use either''.  This shows you to be someone who is willing to make 
	an effort rather than a lazy idiot who requires spoonfeeding.  The former
	is likely to receive help if anyone knows the answer, the latter
	is likely to meet with either stony silence or outright 
	derision.</P
><P
>Write in clear, grammatical and correctly spelt English.  This 
	is incredibly important.  It marks you as a precise and considered 
	thinker. There are no such words as ``u'' or ``b4.''  Try to make yourself look
	like an educated and intelligent person rather than an idiot.  It will
	help.  I promise.</P
><P
>Similarly do not type in all capitals LIKE THIS.  That is
	considered shouting and looks very rude.</P
><P
>Provide clear details stating what the problem is and what you 
	have already tried to do to fix it.  A question like ``My linux has stopped
	working, what can I do?'' is totally useless.  Where has it stopped
	working?  In what way has it stopped working?  You need to be as 
	precise as possible.  There are limits however.  Try not to include irrelevant
	information either.  If you are having problems with your mail client 
	it is unlikely that a dump of your kernel boot log
	(<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dmesg</B
>) would be of help.</P
><P
>	
	</P
><P
>Don't ask for replies by private email.  The point of most Linux
	forums is that everybody can learn something from each other.  Asking
	for private replies simply removes value from the newsgroup or mailing
	list.</P

> Do not post in HTML.  Many Linux users have mail clients which
	can't easily read HTML email.  Whilst with some effort, they
	<EM
>can</EM
> read HTML email, they usually don't.  If you 
	send them HTML mail it often gets deleted unread.  Send plain text
	emails, they will reach a wider audience that way.</P

><P
>After your problem has been solved, post a short followup
	explaining what the problem was and how you solved it.  People will
	appreciate this as it not only gives a sense of closure about the 
	problem but also helps the next time someone has a similar question.  When they
	look at the archives of the newsgroup or mailing list, they will see 
	you had the same problem, the discussion that followed your question and
	your final solution.</P
