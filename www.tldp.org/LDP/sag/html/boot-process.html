>8.2. The boot process in closer look</H1
><P
>When a PC is booted, the BIOS will do various tests to
	check that everything looks all right, and will then start the actual 
	booting.  This process is called the <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>power on self test
	</I
>, or POST for short.  It will choose a disk
	drive (typically the first floppy drive, if there is a floppy
	inserted, otherwise the first hard disk, if one is installed
	in the computer; the order might be configurable, however)
	and will then read its very first sector.  This is called the
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>boot sector</I
>; for a hard disk, it is also
	called the <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>master boot record</I
>, since a
	hard disk can contain several partitions, each with their own
	boot sectors.</P
><P
>The boot sector contains a small program (small enough to
	fit into one sector) whose responsibility is to read the actual
	operating system from the disk and start it.  When booting Linux
	from a floppy disk, the boot sector contains code that just reads
	the first few hundred blocks (depending on the actual kernel
	size, of course) to a predetermined place in memory.  On a Linux
	boot floppy, there is no filesystem, the kernel is just stored
	in consecutive sectors, since this simplifies the boot process.
	It is possible, however, to boot from a floppy with a filesystem,
	by using LILO, the LInux LOader, or GRUB, the GRand Unifying 
	Bootloader.</P
><P
>When booting from the hard disk, the code in the master
	boot record will examine the partition table (also in the master
	boot record), identify the active partition (the partition that is
	marked to be bootable), read the boot sector from that partition,
	and then start the code in that boot sector.  The code in the
	partition's boot sector does what a floppy disk's boot sector
	does: it will read in the kernel from the partition and start it.
	The details vary, however, since it is generally not useful to
	have a separate partition for just the kernel image, so the
	code in the partition's boot sector can't just read the disk
	in sequential order, it has to find the sectors wherever the
	filesystem has put them.  There are several ways around this
	problem, but the most common way is to use  a boot loader like
	LILO or GRUB.  (The details
	about how to do this are irrelevant for this discussion, however;
	see the LILO or GRUB documentation for more information; it is most
	thorough.)</P
><P
>When booting, the bootloader will normally go right ahead
	and read in and boot the default kernel.  It is also possible
	to configure the boot loader to be able to boot one of several kernels,
	or even other operating systems than Linux, and it is possible
	for the user to choose which kernel or operating system is to
	be booted at boot time.  LILO, for example, can be configured so that if one
	holds down the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>alt</B
>, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>shift</B
>, or
	<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>ctrl</B
> key at boot time (when LILO is loaded),
	LILO will ask what is to be booted and not boot the default
	right away.  Alternatively, the bootloader can be configured so that it
	will always ask, with an optional timeout that will cause the
	default kernel to be booted.</P
><P
>It is also possible to give a <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>kernel
	command line argument</I
>, after the name of the kernel
	or operating system.  For a list of possible options you can read
	<A
HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
> 
	http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html</A
>.</P
><P
>Booting from floppy and from hard disk have both their
	advantages, but generally booting from the hard disk is nicer,
	since it avoids the hassle of playing around with floppies.
	It is also faster.  Most Linux distributions will setup the bootloader
	for you during the install process.</P
><P
>After the Linux kernel has been read into the memory, by
	whatever means, and is started for real, roughly the following
	things happen:
	
	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>	The Linux kernel is installed compressed, so it will first
	uncompress itself.  The beginning of the kernel image
	contains a small program that does this.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	If you have a super-VGA card that Linux
	recognizes and that has some special text modes (such as 100
	columns by 40 rows), Linux asks you which mode
	you want to use.  During the kernel compilation, it is
	possible to preset a video mode, so that this is never asked.
	This can also be done with LILO, GRUB or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rdev</B
>.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	After this, the kernel checks what other hardware there is
	(hard disks, floppies, network adapters, etc), and configures
	some of its device drivers appropriately; while it does this,
	it outputs messages about its findings.  For example, when I
	boot, I it looks like this:

	anyway).  </P

>The root filesystem is usually mounted read-only (this can

	to check the filesystem while it is mounted; it is not a good
