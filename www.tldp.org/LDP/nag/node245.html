At this point, you've verified that mail will have the desired default
behavior and that you'll be able to both send and received validly
addressed mail.  To complete the installation, it may be necessary to
create the appropriate dbm tables to get the desired final results.
<P>
After creating the table(s) that are required for your site, you must
process them through dbm by typing make in the directory
containing the tables.
<P>
If you are UUCP-only, you do <em>not</em> need to create any of the tables
mentioned in the README.linux file.  You'll just have to touch
the files so that the Makefile works.
<P>
If you're UUCP-only and you talk to sites in addition to your
smart-host, you'll need to add uucpxtable entries for each (or
mail to them will also go through the smart host) and run dbm
against the revised uucpxtable.
<P>
First, you need to make certain that mail through your
RELAY_HOST is sent to them via the RELAY_MAILER.

<P>
If you have UUCP neighbors other than your RELAY_HOST, you
need to ensure that mail to them has the proper behavior.  Mail
addressed with UUCP-style syntax to a host you talk UUCP with should
go directly to them (unless you explicitly prevent it with a
domaintable entry). Assume host swim is a direct
UUCP neighbor of yours. Then feeding swim!fred to
sendmail should produce the following result:

If you have uucpxtable entries to force UUCP delivery to
certain UUCP neighbors who send their mail with Internet style
domainized headers, that also needs to be tested.
