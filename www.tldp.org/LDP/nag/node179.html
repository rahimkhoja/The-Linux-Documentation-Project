If you want to provide anonymous UUCP access to your system, you first
have to set up a special account for it as described above.  A common
practice is to give it a login name and a password of uucp.
<P>
In addition, you have to set a few of the security options for unknown
systems. For instance, you may want to prohibit them from executing any
commands on your system. However, you cannot set these parameters in a
sys file entry, because the system command requires the
system's name, which you don't have. Taylor UUCP solves this dilemma
through the unknown command. unknown can be used in
the config file to specify any command that can usually appear in
a system entry:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
This will restrict unknown systems to downloading files from below the
pub directory and uploading files to the incoming
directory below /var/spool/uucppublic. The next line will make uucico
ignore any requests from the remote system to turn on debugging
locally.  The last two lines permit unknown systems to execute
rmail; but the command path specified makes uucico look
for the rmail command in a private directory named
anon-bin only. This allows you to provide some special
rmail that, for instance, forwards all mail to the super-user
for examination. This allows anonymous users to reach the maintainer
of the system, but prevents them at the same time from injecting any
mail to other sites.
<P>
To enable anonymous UUCP, you must specify at least one unknown
statement in config. Otherwise uucico will reject any unknown
systems.
