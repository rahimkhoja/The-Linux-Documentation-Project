In  operating systems, the software performing all the tasks and
protocols described above is usually part of the kernel, and so it is in
. The programming interface most common in the  world is
the <em>Berkeley Socket Library</em>. Its name derives from a popular
analogy that views ports as sockets, and connecting to a port as
plugging in. It provides the (bind(2)) call to specify a remote
host, a transport protocol, and a service which a program can connect or
listen to (using connect(2), listen(2), and
accept(2)).  The socket library is however somewhat more general,
in that it provides not only a class of TCP/IP-based sockets (the
AF_INET sockets), but also a class that handles connections
local to the machine (the AF_UNIX class). Some implementations
can also handle other classes as well, like the XNS (<em>Xerox
Networking System</em>) protocol, or X.25.
<P>
In , the socket library is part of the standard libc
C-library. Currently, it only supports AF_INET and AF_UNIX
sockets, but efforts are made to incorporate support for Novell's
networking protocols, so that eventually one or more socket classes for
these would be added.
