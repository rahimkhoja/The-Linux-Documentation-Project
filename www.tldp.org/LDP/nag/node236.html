<P>
Usually, mail to hosts with fully-qualified domain names is delivered via
Internet style (SMTP) delivery using Domain Name Service (DNS), or via the
relay host.  The uucpxtable forces delivery via UUCP routing by
converting the domainized name into a UUCP-style un-domainized remote
hostname.
<P>
It is frequently used when you're a mail forwarder for a site or domain or
when you wish to send mail via a direct and reliable UUCP link rather than
potentially multiple hops through the default mailer and any intermediate
systems and networks.
<P>
UUCP sites that talk to UUCP neighbors who use domainized mail headers would
use this file to force delivery of the mail through the direct UUCP
point-to-point link between the two systems rather than using the less direct
route through the RELAY_MAILER and RELAY_HOST or
through the DEFAULT_MAILER.
<P>
Internet sites who do not talk UUCP probably would not use the
uucpxtable.
<P>
Suppose you provide mail forwarding service to a system called
sesame.com in DNS and sesame in the UUCP maps.  You would need
the following uucpxtable entry to force mail for their host to go
through your direct UUCP connection.
