Although UUCP may be a reasonable choice for low-cost dial-up network
links, there are many situations in which its store-and-forward
technique proves too inflexible, for example in Local Area Networks
(LANs).  These are usually made up of a small number of machines located
in the same building, or even on the same floor, that are interconnected
to provide a homogeneous working environment.  Typically, you would want
to share files between these hosts, or run distributed applications on
different machines.
<P>
These tasks require a completely different approach to networking.
Instead of forwarding entire files along with a job description, all
data is broken up in smaller chunks (packets), which are forwarded
immediately to the destination host, where they are reassembled.  This
type of network is called a <em>packet-switched</em> network.  Among other
things, this allows to run interactive applications over the network.
The cost of this is, of course, a greatly increased complexity in
software.
<P>
The solution that  system--- and many non- sites--- have
adopted is known as TCP/IP.  In this section, we will have a look at its
underlying concepts.
