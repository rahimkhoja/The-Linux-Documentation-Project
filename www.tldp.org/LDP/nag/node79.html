 networking is still evolving.  Major changes at the kernel
layer will bring a very flexible configuration scheme that will allow
you to configure the network devices at run time.  For instance, the
ifconfig command will take arguments that set the IRQ line and
DMA channel.

Another change to come soon is the additional mtu flag to the
route command which will set the Maximum Transmission Unit for a 
particular route.  This route-specific MTU overrides the MTU specified
for the interface.  You will typically use this option for routes
through a gateway, where the link between the gateway and the
destination host requires a very low MTU. For instance, assume 
host wanderer is connected to vlager through a SLIP link.
When sending data from vstout to wanderer, the
networking layer on wanderer would would use packets of up to
1500 bytes, because packets are sent across the Ethernet. The SLIP
link, on the other hand, is operated with an MTU of 296, so the network
layer on vlager would have to break up the IP packets into
smaller fragments that fit into 296 bytes. If instead, you would have
configured the route on vstout to use a MTU of 296 right from
the start, this relatively expensive fragmentation could be avoided:
<pre>
           # route add wanderer gw vlager mtu 296
</pre>

Note that the mtu option also allows you to selectively undo
the effects of the `Subnets Are Local' Policy (SNARL). This policy is
a kernel configuration option and is described in chapter-<A HREF="node41.html#hardware"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
