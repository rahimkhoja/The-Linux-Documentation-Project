<A NAME="smail"></A>
This chapter will give you a quick introduction to setting up smail,
and an overview of the functionality it provides. Although smail
is largely compatible with sendmail in its behavior, their
configuration files are completely different.
<P>
The main configuration file is the /usr/lib/smail/config.  You always
have to edit this file to reflect values specific to your site. If you
are only a UUCP leaf site, you will have relatively little else to do,
ever.  Other files that configure routing and transport options may also
be used; they will be dealt with briefly, too.
<P>
By default, smail processes and delivers all incoming mail
immediately. If you have relatively high traffic, you may instead have
smail collect all messages in the so-called <em>queue</em>, and
process it at regular intervals only.
<P>
When handling mail within a TCP/IP network, smail is frequently
run in daemon mode: at system boot time, it is invoked from
rc.inet2, and puts itself in the background where it waits for
incoming TCP connections on the SMTP port (usually port-25).  This is
very beneficial whenever you expect to have a significant amount of
traffic, because smail isn't started up separately for every
incoming connection. The alternative would be to have inetd
manage the SMTP port, and have it spawn smail whenever there is a
connection on this port.
<P>
smail has a lot a flags that control it behavior; describing
them in detail here wouldn't make help you much. Fortunately,
smail supports a number of standard modes of operation that are
enabled when you invoke it by a special command name, like rmail,
or smtpd.  Usually, these aliases are symbolic links to the
smail binary itself. We will encounter most of them when
discussing the various features of smail.
<P>
There are two links to smail you should have under all
circumstances; namely /usr/bin/rmail and
/usr/sbin/sendmail.<A HREF="footnode.html#7779"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>  When you compose and send a mail message with a user agent like
elm, the message will be piped into rmail for delivery,
with the recipient list given to it on the command line. The same
happens with mail coming in via UUCP. Some versions of elm,
however, invoke /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of rmail, so you
need both of them.  For example, if you keep smail in
/usr/local/bin, type the following at the shell prompt:
<PRE>
           # ln -s /usr/local/bin/smail /usr/bin/rmail
           # ln -s /usr/local/bin/smail /usr/sbin/sendmail
</PRE>
If you want to dig further into the details of configuring smail,
please refer to the manual pages smail(1) and  smail(5).
If it isn't included in your favorite  distribution, you can get
it from the source to smail.
