There are a number of files that control C-News' behavior, but are not
essential to its functioning. All of them reside in /usr/lib/news. We will
describe them briefly.
<DL><DT>newsgroups<DD>  This is a companion file of active which contains a list of newsgroup names, along with a one-line description of its main
                topic.   This  file  is  automatically  updated  when  C  News
                receives a check-news control message (see section 18.8).
<DT>localgroups<DD> If  you  have a number of local groups that you don't want C News to complain about every time you receive a checknews mes-
                sage, put their names and descriptions in this file, just like
                they would appear in newsgroups.


<DT>mailpaths<DD>  This file contains the moderator's address for each moderated group. Each line contains the group name, followed by the mod-
                erator's email address (offset by a tab).
<P>

                      Two special entries are provided as  default.  These  are
                backbone  and internet. Both provide --- in bang-path notation
                --- the path to the nearest backbone site, and the  site  that
                understands  RFC 822-style addresses (user@host).  The default
                entries are

<PRE>
                     internet      backbone
</PRE>
<P>
                    You will not have to change the  internet  entry  if  you
                have  smail or sendmail installed, because they understand RFC
                822-addressing.
<P>

                     The backbone entry is used whenever a  user  posts  to  a
                moderated  group whose moderator is not listed explicitly.  If
                the newsgroup's name is alt.sewer, and the backbone entry con-
                tains path!%s, C News will mail the article to path!alt-sewer,
                hoping that the backbone machine is able to forward the  arti-
                cle. To find out which path to use, ask the news admins at the
                site that feeds you.  As a  last  resort,  you  can  also  use
                uunet.uu.net!%s.
<DT>distributions<DD>   This file is not really a C News file, but it is used by some newsreaders, and nntpd. It contains the list of distribu-
                tions  recognized  by  your  site,  and  a  description of its
                (intended) effect. For example, Virtual Brewery has  the  following file:
		<DL>
			<DT>world<DD>     everywhere in the world
                	<DT>local<DD> Only local to this site 
			<DT>nl<DD>    Netherlands only
			<DT>mugnet<DD>MUGNET only
			<DT>fr<DD>    France only
			<DT>de<DD>    Germany only
			<DT>brewery<DD>Virtual Brewery only
		</DL>
	<DT>log<DD>  This file contains a log of all  C  News  activities.  It  is
                culled  regularly by running newsdaily; copies of the old log-
                files are kept in log.o, log.oo, etc.
	<DT>errlog<DD> This is a log of all error messages created by C  News.  These do  not  include articles junked due to wrong group, etc. This
                file is mailed to the newsmaster (usenet by default) automati-
                cally by newsdaily if it is found to be non-empty.

	<DT>errlog<DD>  is  cleared  by newsdaily. Old copies are kept in
                errlog.o and companions.
	<DT>batchlog<DD> This logs all runs of sendbatches.  It  is  usually  of  scant interest only. It is also attended by newsdaily.
	<DT>watchtime <DD>This is an empty file created each time newswatch is run.
