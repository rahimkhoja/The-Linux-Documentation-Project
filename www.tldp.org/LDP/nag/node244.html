To put sendmail into `test' mode, you invoke it with the -bt
flag.  The default configuration file is the sendmail.cf file that is
installed on the system.  You can test an alternate file by using the
-Cfilename option.
<P>
In the following examples, we test vstout.cf, the configuration
file generated from the vstout.m4 file shown in
figure-<A HREF="node222.html#sendmailfigm4"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

The following tests ensure that sendmail is able to deliver all
mail to users on your system.  In all cases the result of the test
should be the same and point to the local system name with the
LOCAL mailer.
<P>
First test how a mail to a local user would be delivered.

The output shows how sendmail processes the address internally.
It is handed to various rule-sets which analyze it, invoke other
rule-sets in turn, and break it up into its components.
<P>
In our example, we passed the address me to rule-sets 3 and 0
(this is the meaning of the 3,0 entered before the address).
The last line shows the parsed address as returned by rules-et 0,
containing the mailer the message would be delivered by, and the host
and user name given to the mailer.
<P>
Next, test mail to a user on your system with UUCP syntax.

<P>
Next, test mail addressed to a user on your system with Internet syntax
to your fully qualified hostname.
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
You should repeat the above two tests with each of the names you
specified in the PSEUDONYMS and DEFAULT_NAME
parameters in your sendmail.m4 file.
<P>
Lastly, test that you can mail to your relay host.
