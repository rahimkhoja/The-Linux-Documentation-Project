Vital to the understanding of UUCP is the concept of <em>jobs</em>.
Every transfer a user initiates with uucp or uux is
called a job. It is made up of a <em>command</em> to be executed on
a remote system, and a collection of <em>files</em> to be transferred
between sites. One of these parts may be missing.
<P>
As an example, assume you issued the following command on your host, which
makes UUCP copy the file netguide.ps to host pablo, and
makes it execute the lpr command to print the file.

UUCP does not generally call the remote system immediately to execute
a job (else you could make do with kermit). Instead, it
temporarily stores the job description away. This is called
<em>spooling</em>.  The directory tree under which jobs are stored is
therefore called the <em>spool directory</em> and is generally located
in /var/spool/uucp.  In our example, the job description would contain
information about the remote command to be executed (lpr), the
user who requested the execution, and a couple of other items.  In
addition to the job description, UUCP has to store the input file,
netguide.ps.
<P>
The exact location and naming of spool files may vary, depending on
some compile-time options. HDB-compatible UUCP's generally store spool
files in a directory named /var/spool/uucp/site, where
site is the name of the remote site. When compiled for Taylor
configuration, UUCP will create subdirectories below the site-specific
spool directory for different types of spool files.
<P>
At regular intervals, UUCP dials up the remote system.  When a
connection to the remote machine is established, UUCP transfers the
files describing the job, plus any input files.  The incoming jobs
will not be executed immediately, but only after the connection
terminates. This is done by uuxqt, which also takes care of
forwarding any jobs if they are designated for another site.

To distinguish between important and less important jobs, UUCP
associates a <em>grade</em> with each job. This is a single letter,
ranging from 0 through 9, A though Z, and a through z, in decreasing
precedence.  Mail is customarily spooled with grade B or C, while news
is spooled with grade N.  Jobs with higher grade are transferred
earlier. Grades may be assigned using the -g flag when
invoking uucp or uux.
<P>
You can also disallow the transfer of jobs below a given grade at
certain times.  This is also called the <em>maximum spool grade</em>
allowed during a conversation and defaults to-z. Note the
terminological ambiguity here: a file is transferred only if it is
<em>equal or above</em> the maximum spool grade.
