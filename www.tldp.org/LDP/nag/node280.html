Newsreaders are intended to offer the user functionality that allows her
to access the functions of the news system easily, like posting
articles, or skimming the contents of a newsgroup in a comfortable way.
The quality of this interface is subject of endless flame wars.
<P>
There are a couple of newsreaders available which have been ported to
Linux. Below I will describe the basic setup for the three most
popular ones, namely tin, trn, and nn.
<P>
One of the most effective newsreaders is
<PRE>
           $ find /var/spool/news -name '[0-9]*' -exec cat {} \; | more
</PRE>
This is the way  die-hards read their news.
<P>
The majority of newsreaders, however, are much more sophisticated.
They usually offer a full-screen interface with separate levels for
displaying all groups the user has subscribed to, for displaying an
overview of all articles in one group. and for individual articles.
<P>
At the newsgroup level, most newsreaders display a list of articles,
showing their subject line, and the author. In big groups, it is impossible
for the user to keep track of articles relating to each other, although
it is possible to identify responses to earlier articles.
<P>
A response usually repeats the original article's subject, prepending it
with ``Re: ''. Additionally, the message id of the article it is
a direct follow-up to may be given in the References: header
line. Sorting articles by these two criteria generates small clusters
(in fact, trees) of articles, which are called <em>threads</em>. One of the
tasks in writing a newsreader is devising an efficient scheme of
threading, because the time required for this is proportional to the
square of the number of articles.
<P>
Here, we will not dig any further into how the user interfaces are
built. All newsreaders currently available for  have a good help
function, so you ought to get along.
<P>
In the following, we will only deal with administrative tasks. Most of
these relate to the creation of threads databases and accounting.
