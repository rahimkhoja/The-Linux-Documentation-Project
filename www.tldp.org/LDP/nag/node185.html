When compiling the UUCP suite to use Taylor-style logging, you have only
three global log files, all of which reside in the spool directory.  The
main log file is named Log and contains all information about
connections established and files transferred. A typical excerpt looks
like this (after a little reformatting to make it fit the page):
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
<A NAME="6551"></A>
The next important log file is Stats, which lists file transfer
statistics.  The section of Stats corresponding to the above
transfer looks like this:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
Again, the lines have been split to make it fit the page.

The third file if Debug. This is the place where debugging
information is written. If you use debugging, you should make sure
that this file has a protection mode of 600. Depending on the debug
mode you selected, it may contain the login and password you use to
connect to the remote system.

Some UUCP binaries included in  distributions have been compiled
to use HDB-style logging. HDB UUCP uses a whole bunch of log files
stored below /var/spool/uucp/.Log. This directory contains three more
directories, named uucico, uuxqt, and uux.  They
contain the logging output generated by each of the corresponding
commands, sorted into different files for each site. Thus, output from
uucico when calling site pablo will go into
.Log/uucico/pablo, while the subsequent uuxqt run will
write to .Log/uuxqt/pablo. The lines written to the various
lofiles are however the same as with Taylor logging.
<P>
When you enable debugging output with HDB-style logging compiled in, it
will go to the .Admin directory below /var/spool/uucp. During outgoing
calls, debugging information will be sent to .Admin/audit.local,
while the output from uucico when someone calls in will go to
.Admin/audit.
