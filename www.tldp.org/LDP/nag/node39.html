We have seen above that DNS does not only deal with IP-addresses of
hosts, but also exchanges information on name servers.  There are in
fact a whole bunch of different types of entries the DNS database may
have.
<P>
A single piece of information from the DNS database is called a
<em>resource record</em>, or RR for short. Each record has a type
associated with it, describing the sort of data it represents, and a
class specifying the type of network it applies to. The latter
accommodates the needs of different addressing schemes, like
IP-addresses (the IN class), or addresses of Hesiod networks (used at
MIT), and a few more.  The prototypical resource record type is the A
record which associates a fully qualified domain name with an
IP-address.
<P>
Of course, a host may have more than one name. However, one of these
names must be identified as the official, or <em>canonical host name</em>,
while the others are simply aliases referring to the former. The
difference is that the canonical host name is the one with an A record
associated, while the others only have a record of type CNAME which
points to the canonical host name.
<P>
We will not go through all record types here, but save them for a later
chapter, but rather give you a brief example here.
Figure-<A HREF="node40.html#introfighosts"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows a part of the domain database that is
loaded into the name servers for the physics.groucho.edu zone.
<P>
Apart from A and CNAME records, you can see a special record at the top
of the file, stretching several lines. This is the SOA resource record,
signaling the <em>Start of Authority</em>, which holds general information
on the zone the server is authoritative for. This comprises, for
instance, the default time-to-live for all records.
<P>
Note that all names in the sample file that do not end with a dot should
be interpreted relative to the groucho.edu domain.  The special
name ``@'' used in the SOA record refers to the domain name by
itself.
<P>
We have seen above that the name servers for the groucho.edu
domain somehow have to know about the physics zone so that they
can point queries to their name servers. This is usually achieved by a
pair of records: the NS record that gives the server's FQDN, and
an A record associating an address with that name. Since these records
are what holds the name space together, they are frequently called the
<em>glue records</em>.  They are the only instances of records where a
parent zone actually holds information on hosts in the subordinate zone.
The glue records pointing to the name servers for
physics.groucho.edu are shown in figure-<A HREF="node40.html#introfignsptr"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
