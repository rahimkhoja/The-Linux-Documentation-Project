To negotiate session control and file transfers with the remote end,
uucico uses a set of standardized messages. This is often
referred to as the high-level protocol. During the initialization phase
and the hangup phase these are simply sent across as strings. However,
during the real transfer phase, an additional low-level protocol is
employed which is mostly transparent to the higher levels. This is to
make error checks possible when using unreliable lines, for instance.
