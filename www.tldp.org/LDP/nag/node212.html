A user may redirect her mail by having it forwarded to an alternative
address using one of two methods supported by smail.  One option
is to put
<PRE>
           Forward to recipient,... 
</PRE>
in the first line of her mailbox file.  This will send all incoming mail
to the specified list of recipients. Alternatively, she might create
a .forward file in her home directory, which contains the
comma-separated list of recipients.  With this variety of forwarding,
all lines of the file are read and interpreted.
<P>
Note that any type of address may be used. Thus, a practical example
of a .forward file for vacations might be
<PRE>
           janet, "|vacation"
</PRE>
The first address delivers the incoming message to janet's
mailbox nevertheless, while the vacation command returns a short
notification to the sender.
