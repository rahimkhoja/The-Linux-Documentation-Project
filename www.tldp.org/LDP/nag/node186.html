<A NAME="mail"></A>
One of the most prominent uses of networking since the first networks
were devised, has been electronic mail.  It started as a simple service
that copied a file from one machine to another, and appended it to the
recipient's <em>mailbox</em> file. Basically, this is still what email is
all about, although an ever growing net with its complex routing
requirements and its ever increasing load of messages has made a more
elaborate scheme necessary.
<P>
Various standards of mail exchange have been devised. Sites on the
Internet adhere to one laid out in RFC-822, augmented by some RFCs that
describe a machine-independent way of transferring special characters,
and the like. Much thought has also been given recently to ``multi-media
mail'', which deals with including pictures and sound in mail messages.
Another standard, X.400, has been defined by CCITT.
<P>
Quite a number of mail transport programs have been implemented for
 systems. One of the best-known is the University of Berkeley's
sendmail, which is used on a number of platforms. The original
author was Eric Allman, who is now actively working on the
sendmail team again.  There are two  ports of
sendmail-5.56c available, one of which will be described in
chapter-<A HREF="node218.html#sendmail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. The sendmail version currently being
developed is 8.6.5.
<P>
The mail agent most commonly used with  is smail-3.1.28,
written and copyrighted by Curt Landon Noll and Ronald S.-Karr. This is the
one included in most  distributions.  In the following, we will
refer to it simply as smail, although there are other versions of it
which are entirely different, and which we don't describe here.
<P>
Compared to sendmail, smail is rather young. When handling
mail for a small site without complicated routing requirements, their
capabilities are pretty close. For large sites, however, sendmail
always wins, because its configuration scheme is much more flexible.
<P>
Both smail and sendmail support a set of configuration
files that have to be customized. Apart from the information that is
required to make the mail subsystem run (such as the local hostname),
there are many more parameters that may be tuned.  sendmail's
main configuration file is very hard to understand at first. It looks as
if your cat had taken a nap on your keyboard with the shift key pressed.
smail configuration files are more structured and easier to
understand than sendmail's, but don't give the user as much power
in tuning the mailer's behavior.  However, for small UUCP or Internet
sites the work required in setting up any of them is roughly the same.
<P>
In this chapter, we will deal with what email is and what issues you as
an administrator will have to deal with.  Chapters-<A HREF="node198.html#smail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
and-<A HREF="node218.html#sendmail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> will give instructions on setting up smail and
sendmail for the first time.  The information provided there
should suffice to get smaller sites operational, but there are many more
options, and you can spend many happy hours in front of your computer
configuring the fanciest features.
<P>
Toward the end of the current chapter we will briefly cover setting up
elm, a very common mail user agent on many ish systems,
including .
<P>
For more information about issues specific to electronic mail on
, please refer to the Electronic Mail HOWTO by Vince Skahan,
which is posted to comp.os.linux.announce regularly.  The
source distributions of elm, smail and sendmail
also contain very extensive documentation that should answer most of
your questions on setting them up.  If you are looking for information
on email in general, there's a number of RFCs that deal with this
topic. They are listed in the bibliography at the end of the book.
