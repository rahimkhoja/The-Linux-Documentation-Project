Some of the configuration tools of the Net-2 release rely on
the proc filesystem for communicating with the kernel. This
is an interface that permits access to kernel run-time information
through a filesystem-like mechanism. When mounted, you can list its
files like any other filesystem, or display their contents.  Typical
items include the loadavg file that contains the system load
average, or meminfo, which shows current core memory and swap
usage.
<P>
To this, the networking code adds the net directory.
It contains a number of files that show things like the
kernel ARP tables, the state of TCP connections, and the routing tables.
Most network administration tools get their information from these files.

The proc filesystem (or procfs as it is also known)
is usually mounted on /proc at system boot time. The best 
method is to add the following line to /etc/fstab:
<pre>
           # procfs mont point:
           none            /proc           proc    defaults
</pre>
and execute ``mount /proc'' from your /etc/rc script.
<P>
The procfs is nowadays configured into most kernels by default.
If the procfs is not in your kernel, you will get a message like
``mount: fs type procfs not supported by kernel''. You will then
have to recompile the kernel and answer ``yes'' when asked for
procfs support.
