Absurd as it may sound at the first moment, using UUCP to transfer data
over TCP not that bad an idea, especially when transferring large
amount of data such as Usenet news.  On TCP-based links, news is
generally exchanged using the NNTP protocol, where articles are
requested and sent individually, without compression or any other
optimization.  Although adequate for large sites with several concurrent
news-feeds, this technique is very unfavorable for small sites that
receive their news over a slow connection such as ISDN.  These sites
will usually want to combine the qualities of TCP with the advantages of
sending news in large batches, which can be compressed and thus
transferred with very low overhead. A standard way to transfer these
batches is to use UUCP over TCP.
<P>
In sys, you would specify a system to be called via TCP
in the following way:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
The address command gives the IP address of the host, or its
fully qualified domain name.  The corresponding port entry would
read:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
The entry states that a TCP connection should be used when a sys
entry references tcp-conn, and that uucico should
attempt to connect to the TCP network port 540 on the remote host.  This
is the default port number of the UUCP service. Instead of the port
number, you may also give a symbolic port name to the service
command. The port number corresponding to this name will be looked up
in /etc/services. The common name for the UUCP service is
uucpd.
