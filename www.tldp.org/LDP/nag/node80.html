As discussed in chapter-<A HREF="node23.html#tcpip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, TCP/IP networking may rely on
different schemes to convert names into addresses.  The simplest way,
which takes no advantage of the way the name space has been split up
into zones is a host table stored in /etc/hosts.  This is
useful only for small LANs that are run by one single administrator,
and otherwise have no IP-traffic with the outside world.  The format
of the hosts file has already been described in
chapter-<A HREF="node58.html#iface"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

Alternatively, you may use BIND-- the Berkeley Internet Name Domain
Service--  for resolving host names to IP-addresses.  Configuring BIND
may be a real chore, but once you've done it, changes in the network
topology are easily made. On, as on many other ish
systems, name service is provided through a program called named.
At startup, it loads a set of  master files into its cache, and waits
for queries from remote or local user processes. There are different
ways to set up BIND, and not all require you to run a name server on
every host.
<P>
This chapter can do little more but give a rough sketch of how to
operate a name server. If you plan to use BIND in an environment with
more than just a small LAN and probably an Internet up-link, you should
get a good book on BIND, for instance Cricket Liu's ``DNS and BIND''
(see [<A HREF="#liudns"></A>]). For current information, you may also want to
check the release notes contained in the BIND sources. There's also a
newsgroup for DNS questions called comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains.
