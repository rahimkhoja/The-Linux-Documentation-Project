A simple way to distribute news within a local network is to keep all
news on a central host, and export the relevant directories via NFS, so
that newsreaders may scan the articles directly.  The advantage of this
method over NNTP is that the overhead involved in retrieving and
threading articles is significantly lower. NNTP, on the other hand, wins
in a heterogeneous network where equipment varies widely among hosts, or
where users don't have equivalent accounts on the server machine.
<P>
When using NFS, articles posted on a local host have to be forwarded to
the central machine, because accessing administrative files might
otherwise expose the system to race-conditions that leave the files
inconsistent. Also, you might want to protect your news spool area by
exporting it read-only, which requires forwarding to the central
machine, too.
<P>
C-News handles this transparently. When you post an article, your
newsreader usually invokes inews to inject the article into the
news system. This command runs a number of checks on the article,
completes the header, and checks the file server in /usr/lib/news. If
this file exists and contains a hostname different from the local host's
name, inews is invoked on that server host via rsh. Since
the inews script uses a number of binary commands and support files
from C-News, you have to either have C-News installed locally, or mount
the news software from the server.
<P>
For the rsh invocation to work properly, each user must have an
equivalent account on the server system, i.e. one to which she can log
in without being asked for a password.
<P>
Make sure that the hostname given in server literally matches the
output of the hostname(1) command on the server machine, else
C-News will loop forever when trying to deliver the article.
