The idea of network news was born in 1979 when two graduate students, Tom
Truscott and Jim Ellis, thought of using UUCP to connect machines for the 
purpose of information exchange among  users. They set up
a small network of three machines in North Carolina.
<P>
Initially, traffic was handled by a number of shell scripts (later
rewritten in C), but they were never released to the public. They
were quickly replaced by ``A'' news, the first public release of news
software.
<P>
``A'' news was not designed to handle more than a few articles
per group and day. When the volume continued to grow, it was rewritten
by Mark Horton and Matt Glickman, who called it the ``B'' release
(a.k.a. Bnews). The first public release of Bnews was version-2.1
in 1982. It was expanded continuously, with several new features 
being added. Its current version is Bnews-2.11. It is slowly
becoming obsolete, with its last official maintainer having switched to
INN.

Another rewrite was done and released in 1987 by Geoff Collyer and Henry
Spencer; this is release ``C'', or C-News. In the time following there
have been a number of patches to C-News, the most prominent being the
C-News Performance Release. On sites that carry a large number of groups,
the overhead involved in frequently invoking relaynews, which is
responsible for dispatching incoming articles to other hosts, is
significant. The Performance Release adds an option to relaynews
that allows to run it in <em>daemon mode</em>, in which the program puts
itself in the background.
<P>
The Performance Release is the C-News version currently included in most
 releases.

All news releases up to ``C'' are primarily targeted for UUCP networks,
although they may be used in other environments as well.  Efficient news
transfer over networks like TCP/IP, DECNet, or related requires a new
scheme. This was the reason why, in 1986, the ``Network News Transfer
Protocol'', NNTP, was introduced. It is based on network connections,
and specifies a number of commands to interactively transfer and
retrieve articles.
<P>
There are a number of NNTP-based applications available from
the Net. One of them is the nntpd package by Brian Barber
and Phil Lapsley, which you can use, among other things, to
provides newsreading service to a number of hosts inside a local
network. nntpd was designed to complement news packages such as
Bnews or C-News to give them NNTP features.

A different NNTP package is INN, or Internet News. It is not merely
a front end, but a news system by its own right. It comprises a
sophisticated news relay daemon that is capable of maintaining
several concurrent NNTP links efficiently, and is therefore the
news server of choice for many Internet sites.
