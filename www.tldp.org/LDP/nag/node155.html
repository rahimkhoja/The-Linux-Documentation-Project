Before you start writing the UUCP configuration files, you have to
gather some information it needs to know.
<P>
First, you will have to figure out what serial device your modem is
attached to.  Usually, the (DOS) ports COM1 through COM4 map to the
device special files /dev/cua0 through /dev/cua3.  Most
distributions, such as Slackware, create a link /dev/modem as a
link to the appropriate cua* device file, and configure
kermit, seyon, etc, to use this generic file.  In this
case, you should either use /dev/modem in your UUCP
configuration, too.
<P>
The reason for this is that all dial-out programs use so-called
<em>lock files</em> to signal when a serial port is in use. The names of
these lock files are a concatenation of the string LCK.. and
the device file name, for instance LCK..cua1. If programs use
different names for the same device, they will fail to recognize each
other's lock files.  As a consequence, they will disrupt each other's
session when started at the same time.  This is not an unlikely event
when you schedule your UUCP calls using a crontab entry.
<P>
For details of setting up your serial ports, please refer to
chapter-<A HREF="node53.html#serial"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
Next, you must find out at what speed your modem and  will
communicate.  You will have to set this to the maximum effective
transfer rate you expect to get. The effective transfer rate may be
much higher than the raw physical transfer rate your modem is capable
of.  For instance, many modems send and receive data at 2400bps (bits
per second).  Using compression protocols such as V.42bis, the actual
transfer rate may climb up to 9600bps.
<P>
Of course, if UUCP is to do anything, you will need the phone number of
a system to call.  Also, you will need a valid login id and possibly a
password for the remote machine.<A HREF="footnode.html#6604"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>

You will also have to know <em>exactly</em> how to log into the system.
E.g., do you have to press the BREAK key before the login prompt
appears? Does it display login: or user:? This is
necessary for composing the <em>chat script</em>, which is a recipe telling
uucico how to log in. If you don't know, or if the usual chat
script fails, try to call the system with a terminal program like
kermit or minicom, and write down exactly what you have
to do.
