Most, if not all, network applications rely on the local host's
name having been set to some reasonable value. This is usually
done during the boot procedure by executing the hostname
command. To set the hostname to name, it is invoked as
<Pre>
           # hostname name
</pre>
It is common practice to use the unqualified hostname without any
domain name for this. For instance, hosts at the Virtual Brewery might
be called vale.vbrew.com, vlager.vbrew.com, etc.  These
are their official, fully qualified domain names.  Their local
hostnames would be only the first component of the name, such as
vale. However, as the local hostname is frequently used to look
up the host's IP-address, you have to make sure that the resolver
library is able to look up the host's IP-address. This usually means
that you have to enter the name in /etc/hosts (see below).

Some people suggest to use the domainname command to set the
kernel's idea of a domain name to the remaining part of the FQDN. In
this way you could combine the output from hostname and
domainname to get the FQDN again.  However, this is at best
only half correct. domainname is generally used to set the
host's NIS domain, which may be entirely different from the DNS domain
your host belongs to.  NIS is covered in chapter-<A HREF="node130.html#nis"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
