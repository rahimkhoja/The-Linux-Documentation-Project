NIS and NIS+ share little more than their name and a common goal.
NIS+ is structured in an entirely different way. Instead of a flat
name space with disjoint NIS domains, it uses a hierarchical name space
similar to that of DNS. Instead of maps, so called <em>tables</em> are
used that are made up of rows and columns, where each row represents an
object in the NIS+ database, while the columns cover those properties
of the objects that NIS+ knows and cares about. Each table for a
given NIS+ domain comprises those of its parent domains. In addition,
an entry in a table may contain a link to another table. These features
make it possible to structure information in many ways.
<P>
Traditional NIS has an RPC version number of-2, while NIS+ is
version-3.
<P>
NIS+ does not seem to be very widely used yet, and I don't really
know that much about it. (Well, almost nothing). For this reason, we
will not deal with it here. If you are interested in learning more about
it, please refer to Sun's NIS+ administration manual
([<A HREF="#nisplus"></A>]).
