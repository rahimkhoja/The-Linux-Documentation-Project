<P>
In an ideal world (from the Internet perspective), all hosts have records in
the Domain Name Service (DNS) and will send mail with fully qualified domain
names.
<P>
If you happen to talk via UUCP to such a site, you can force mail to go
through the point-to-point UUCP connection rather than through your default
mailer by essentially ``undomainizing'' their hostname through the
uucpxtable.
<P>
To force UUCP delivery to sesame.com, you would put the following in
your uucpxtable:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
The result is that sendmail will then determine (via
UUCPNODES in the sendmail.m4 file) that you are
directly connected to the remote system and will queue the mail for
delivery with UUCP.
