The next few chapters will deal with configuring  for
TCP/IP networking, and with running some major applications.
Before getting our hands dirty with file editing and the like,
we will examine IP a little closer in chapter-<A HREF="node23.html#tcpip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. If you
already know about the way IP-routing works, and how address resolution
is performed, you might want to skip this chapter.
<P>
Chapter-<A HREF="node41.html#hardware"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> deals with the very basic configuration issues,
such as building a kernel and setting up your Ethernet board.
The configuration of your serial ports is covered in a separate
chapter, because the discussion does not apply to TCP/IP networking
only, but is also relevant for UUCP.
<P>
Chapter-<A HREF="node58.html#iface"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> helps you to set up your machine for TCP/IP
networking.  It contains installation hints for stand-alone hosts with
only loopback enabled, and hosts connected to an Ethernet.  It will also
introduce you to a few useful tools you can use to test and debug your
setup. The next chapter discusses how to configure hostname
resolution, and explains how to set up a name server.
<P>
This is followed by two chapters featuring the configuration and use of
SLIP and PPP, respectively. Chapter <A HREF="node92.html#slip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> explains how to establish
SLIP connections, and gives a detailed reference of dip, a
tool that allows you to automate most of the necessary steps.
Chapter-<A HREF="node107.html#ppp"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> covers PPP and pppd, the PPP daemon you
need for this.
<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node124.html#appl"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> gives a short introduction to setting up some of the
most important network applications, such as rlogin, rcp,
etc, in chapter-<A HREF="node124.html#appl"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  This also covers how services are managed
by the inetd super, and how you may restrict certain
security-relevant services to a set of trusted hosts.
<P>
The next two chapters discuss NIS, the Network Information System, and
NFS, the Network File System.  NIS is a useful tool to distribute
administrative information such as user passwords in a local area
network.  NFS allows you to share file systems between several hosts in
your network.
<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node146.html#uucp"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> gives you an extensive introduction to the
administration of Taylor UUCP, a free implementation of the UUCP suite.
<P>
The remainder of the book is taken up by a detailed tour of electronic
mail and Usenet News. Chapter-<A HREF="node186.html#mail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> introduces you to the central
concepts of electronic mail, like what a mail address looks like, and
how the mail handling system manages to get your message to the
recipient.
<P>
Chapters-<A HREF="node198.html#smail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and-<A HREF="node218.html#sendmail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> each cover the setup of
smail and sendmail, two mail transport agents you can use
for .  This book explains both of them, because smail is
easier to install for the beginner, while sendmail is more
flexible.
<P>
Chapters-<A HREF="node255.html#news"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and-<A HREF="node259.html#cnews"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> explain the way news are managed in
Usenet, and how you install and use C-news, a popular software package
for managing Usenet news. Chapter-<A HREF="node274.html#nntp"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> briefly covers how to set
up an NNTP daemon to provide news reading access for your local network.
Chapter-<A HREF="node280.html#newsreaders"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> finally shows you how to configure and
maintain various newsreaders.
