<A NAME="introuucphowto"></A>
The idea behind UUCP is rather simple: as its name indicates, it
basically copies files from one host to another, but it also allows
certain actions to be performed on the remote host.
<P>
Suppose your machine is allowed to access a hypothetical host named
swim, and have it execute the lpr print command for you.
Then you could type the following on your command line to have this
book printed on swim:<A HREF="footnode.html#416"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<pre>
	$ uux -r swim!lpr !netguide.dvi
</pre>
This makes uux, a command from the UUCP suite, schedule a
<em>job</em> for swim. This job consists of the input file,
netguide.dvi, and the request to feed this file to lpr.
The -r flag tells uux not to call the remote system
immediately, but to rather store the job away until a connection
is established at a later occasion. This is called <em>spooling</em>.
<P>
<A NAME="287"></A>
Another property of UUCP is that it allows to forward jobs and files
through several hosts, provided they cooperate. Assume that swim
from the above examples has a UUCP link with groucho, which
maintains a large archive of  applications.  To download the file
tripwire-1.0.tar.gz to your site, you might issue
<pre>
           $ uucp  -mr  swim!groucho!~/security/tripwire-1.0.tar.gz
           trip.tgz
</pre>
The job created will request swim to fetch the file from
groucho, and send it to your site, where UUCP will store it
in trip.tgz and notify you via mail of the file's arrival.
This will be done in three steps. First, your site sends the job to
swim. When swim establishes contact with groucho the
next time, it downloads the file. The final step is the actual
transfer from swim to your host.
<P>
The most important services provided by UUCP networks these days
are electronic mail and news. We will come back to these later,
so we will give only a brief introduction here.
<P>
Electronic mail-- email for short-- allows you to exchange
messages with users on remote hosts without actually having to know
how to access these hosts. The task of directing a message from your
site to the destination site is performed entirely by the mail
handling system. In a UUCP environment, mail is usually transported
by executing the rmail command on a neighboring host, passing
it the recipient address and the mail message. rmail will
then forward the message to another host, and so on, until it reaches
the destination host. We will look at this in detail in
chapter-<A HREF="node186.html#mail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
News may best be described as sort of a distributed bulletin board
system. Most often, this term refers to Usenet News, which is by far the
most widely known news exchange network with an estimated number of
120,000-participating sites.  The origins of Usenet date back to 1979,
when, after the release of UUCP with the new Unix-V7, three graduate
students had the idea of a general information exchange within the Unix
community. They put together some scripts, which became the first netnews
system. In 1980, this network connected duke, unc, and
phs, at two Universities in North Carolina.  Out of this, Usenet
eventually grew. Although it originated as a UUCP-based network, it is no
longer confined to one single type of network.
<P>
The basic unit of information is the article, which may be posted to
a hierarchy of newsgroups dedicated to specific topics. Most
sites receive only a selection of all newsgroups, which carry an
average of 60MB worth of articles a day.
<P>
In the UUCP world, news is generally sent across a UUCP link by collecting
all articles from the groups requested, and packing them up in a number of
<em>batches</em>. These are sent to the receiving site, where they are fed to
the rnews command for unpacking and further processing.
<P>
Finally, UUCP is also the medium of choice for many dial-up archive sites
which offer public access.  You can usually access them by dialing them up
with UUCP, logging in as a guest user, and download files from a publicly
accessible archive area. These guest accounts often have a login name and
password of uucp/nuucp or something similar.
