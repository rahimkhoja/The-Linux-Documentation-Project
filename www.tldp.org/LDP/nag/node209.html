<A NAME="smailpathalias"></A>
smail expects to find the pathalias database in the paths
file below /usr/lib/smail. This file is optional, so if you don't want to
perform any pathalias routing at all, simply remove any existing
paths file.
<P>
paths must be a sorted ASCII file that contains entries which map
destination site names to UUCP bang paths. The file has to be sorted
because smail uses a binary search for looking up a site.
Comments are not allowed in this file, and the site name must be
separated from the path using a TAB.  Pathalias databases are discussed
in somewhat greater detail in chapter-<A HREF="node186.html#mail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
If you generate this file by hand, you should make sure to include all
legal names for a site. For example, if a site is known by both a plain
UUCP name and a fully qualified domain name, you have to add an entry
for each of them.  The file can be sorted by piping it through the
sort(1) command.
<P>
If your site is only a leaf site, however, then no paths
file should be necessary at all: just set up the smart host
attributes in your config file, and leave all routing to
your mail feed.
