<P>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<P>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of 
    what it does.
    Copyright &#169;19yy  name of author
<P>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
<P>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<P>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<P>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items-whatever suits your program.
<P>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<P>

  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

An enormous difficulty in networking is to remember what all the
abbreviations and terms one encounters really mean. Here's a list of
those used frequently throughout the guide, along with a short
explanation.

Books
<P>
The following is a list of books you might want to read to if you want
to know more about some of the topics covered in the Networking Guide.
It is not very complete or systematic, I just happen to have read them
and find them quite useful. Any additions to, and enhancement of
this list are welcome.

HOWTOs
The following is an excerpt of the HOWTO-INDEX, version-2.0
(17-March 1994), written by Matt Welsh.
<P>
What are  HOWTOs?
<P>
 HOWTOs are short online documents which describe in detail a
certain aspect of configuring or using the  system. For example,
there is the Installation HOWTO, which gives instructions on
installing , and the Mail HOWTO, which describes how to set up
and configure mail under .  Other examples include the
NET-2-HOWTO (previously the NET-2-FAQ) and the Printing HOWTO.
<P>
Information in HOWTOs is generally more detailed and in-depth than
what can be squeezed into the  FAQ. For this reason, the 
FAQ is being rewritten. A large amount of the information contained
therein will be relegated to various HOWTO documents.  The FAQ will be
a shorter list of frequently asked questions about , covering
small specific topics. Most of the ``useful'' information in the FAQ
will now be covered in the HOWTOs.
<P>
HOWTOs are comprehensive documents--much like an FAQ but generally
not in question-and-answer format. However, many HOWTOs contain an FAQ
section at the end. For example, the NET-2-FAQ has been renamed to the
NET-2-HOWTO, because it wasn't in question-and-answer format. However,
you will see the NET-2-HOWTO named as the NET-2-FAQ in many places.
The two docs are one and the same.
<P>
Where to get  HOWTOs
<P>
HOWTOs can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from the following sites:
<P>
<UL><LI>
	sunsite.unc.edu:/pub//docs/HOWTO<LI>
	tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/HOWTO
</UL>
<P>
   as well as the many mirror sites, which are listed in the 
   META-FAQ (see below).
<P>
The Index, printed below, lists the currently available HOWTOs.
<P>
HOWTOs are also posted regularly to the newsgroups comp.os.linux and
comp.os.linux.announce. In addition, a number of the HOWTOs will be
cross-posted to news.answers.  Therefore, you can find the 
HOWTOs on the news.answers archive site rtfm.mit.edu.
