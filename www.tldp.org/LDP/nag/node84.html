When configuring the resolver library to use the BIND name service for
host lookups, you also have to tell it which name servers to use.
There is a separate file for this, called resolv.conf.
If this file does not exist or is empty, the resolver assumes the
name server is on your local host.
<P>
If you run a name server on your local host, you have to set it up
separately, as will be explained in the following section.
If your are on a local network and have the opportunity to use an
existing nameserver, this should always be preferred.
<P>
The most important option in resolv.conf is nameserver,
which gives the IP-address of a name server to use. If you specify
several name servers by giving the nameserver option several
times, they are tried in the order given. You should therefore put the
most reliable server first.  Currently, up to three name servers are
supported.
<P>
If no nameserver option is given, the resolver attempts
to connect to the name server on the local host.
<p>
Two other options, domain and search deal with default
domains that are tacked onto a hostname if BIND fails to resolve it
with the first query. The search option specifies a list of
domain names to be tried. The list items are separated by spaces
or tabs.
<P>
If no search option is given, a default search list is constructed
from the local domain name by using the domain name itself, plus all
parent domains up to the root. The local domain name may be given using
the domain statement; if none is given, the resolver obtains
it through the getdomainname(2) system call.
<P>
If this sounds confusing to you, consider this sample resolv.conf
file for the Virtual Brewery:
<pre>
           # /etc/resolv.conf
           # Our domain
           domain         vbrew.com
           #
           # We use vlager as central nameserver:
           nameserver     191.72.1.1

</pre>
When resolving the name vale, the resolver would look up
vale, and failing this, vale.vbrew.com, and
vale.com.
