Name servers that hold all information on hosts within a zone are
called <em>authoritative</em> for this zone, and are sometimes referred
to as <em>master name servers</em>. Any query for a host within this
zone will finally wind down at one of these master name servers.

To provide a coherent picture of a zone, its master servers must be
fairly well synchronized. This is achieved by making one of them the
<em>primary</em> server, which loads its zone information from data
files, and making the others <em>secondary</em> servers who transfer the
zone data from the primary server at regular intervals.
<P>
One reason to have several name servers is to distribute work load,
another is redundancy. When one name server machine fails in a benign
way, like crashing or losing its network connection, all queries will
fall back to the other servers. Of course, this scheme doesn't protect
you from server malfunctions that produce wrong replies to all DNS
requests, e.g. from software bugs in the server program itself.

Of course, you can also think of running a name server that is not
authoritative for any domain.<A HREF="footnode.html#1748"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> This type of server is useful nevertheless, as it is still able to
conduct DNS queries for the applications running on the local network,
and cache the information. It is therefore called a <em>caching-only</em>
server.
