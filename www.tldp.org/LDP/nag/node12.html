On serial lines, a ``de facto'' standard known as SLIP or 
<em>Serial Line IP</em> is frequently used.
A modification of SLIP is known as CSLIP, or <em>compressed SLIP</em>,
and performs compression of IP-headers to make better use of the
relatively low bandwidth provided by serial links.<A HREF="footnode.html#523"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> A different serial protocol is <a href="node107.html">PPP</a>, or <em>Point-to-Point Protocol</em>.
PPP has many more features than SLIP, including a link negotiation
phase. Its main advantage over SLIP is, however, that it isn't
limited to transporting IP-datagrams, but that it was designed to
allow for any type of datagrams to be transmitted.
