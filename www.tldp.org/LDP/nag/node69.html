Configuring a machine to switch packets between two Ethernets is
pretty straightforward. Assume we're back at vlager, which
is equipped with two Ethernet boards, each being connected to one
of the two networks. All you have to do is configure both interfaces
separately, giving them their respective IP-address, and that's it.
<P>
It is quite useful to add information on the two interfaces to
the hosts file in the way shown below, so we have handy
names for them, too:
<pre>
           191.72.1.1      vlager      vlager.vbrew.com
           191.72.1.1      vlager-if1
           191.72.2.1      vlager-if2

 
</pre>
The sequence of commands to set up the two interfaces is then:
<Pre>
           # ifconfig eth0 vlager-if1
           # ifconfig eth1 vlager-if2
           # route add brew-net
           # route add wine-net
 
</Pre>
