We now return to the configuration files.  Taylor UUCP gets its
information from the following files:

<P>
Taylor configuration files are generally made up of lines containing
keyword-value pairs. A hash sign introduces a comment that intends
to the end of the line. To use a hash sign by itself, you may escape it
with a backslash.

There are quite a number of options you can tune with these
configuration files.  We can't go into all parameters here, but will
only cover the most important ones. They you should be able to
configure a modem-based UUCP link.  Additional sections will describe
the modifications necessary if you want to use UUCP over TCP/IP or
over a direct serial line.  A complete reference is given in the
Texinfo documents that accompany the Taylor UUCP sources.

When you think you have configured your UUCP system completely, you
can check your configuration using the uuchk tool (located in
/usr/lib/uucp). uuchk reads your configuration files, and prints
out a detailed report of the configuration values used for each
system.
