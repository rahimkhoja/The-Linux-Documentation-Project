By default, pppd will log any warnings and error messages to
syslog's daemon facility.  You have to add an entry
to syslog.conf that redirects this to a file, or even the
console, otherwise syslog simply discards these messages. The
following entry sends all messages to /var/log/ppp-log:
<Pre>
           daemon.*                /var/log/ppp-log

 
</Pre>
If your PPP setup doesn't work at once, looking into this log file
should give you a first hint of what goes wrong. If this doesn't help,
you can also turn on extra debugging output using the debug
option. This makes pppd log the contents of all control packets
sent or received to syslog.  All messages will go to the
daemon facility.
<P>
Finally, the most drastic feature is to enable kernel-level debugging
by invoking pppd with the kdebug option.  It is
followed by a numeric argument that is the bitwise OR of the following
values: 1 for general debug messages, 2 for printing the contents of
all incoming HDLC frames, and 4 to make the driver print all outgoing
HDLC frames. To capture kernel debugging messages, you must either run
a syslogd daemon that reads the /proc/kmsg file, or the
klogd daemon. Either of them directs kernel debugging to
syslog's kernel facility.
