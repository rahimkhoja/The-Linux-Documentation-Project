After the general option part is complete, the configuration will go
on to ask you for various features such as SCSI drivers, etc. The
subsequent list questions deal with networking support. The exact set
of configuration options is in constant flux because of the ongoing
development. A typical list of options offered by most kernel versions
around 1.0 and 1.1 looks like this (comments are given in italics):

	Despite the macro name displayed in brackets, you must
	answer this question with y if you want to use <em>any</em>
	type of networking devices, regardless of whether this is
	Ethernet, SLIP, or PPP.  When answering this question with
	y, support for Ethernet-type devices is enabled
	automatically.  Support for other types of network drivers
	must be enabled separately:

	These questions concern the various link layer protocols
	supported by .  SLIP allows you to transport IP
	datagrams across serial lines.  The compressed header option
	provides support for CSLIP, a technique that compresses
	TCP/IP headers to as little as three bytes.  Note that this
	kernel option does not turn on CSLIP automatically, it
	merely provides the necessary kernel functions for it.
<P>
	PPP is another protocol to send network traffic across
	serial lines.  It is much more flexible than SLIP, and is
	not limited to IP, but will also support IPX once it is
	implemented.  As PPP support has been completed only lately,
	this option may not be present in your kernel.
<P>
	PLIP provides for a way to send IP datagrams across a
	parallel port connection.  It is mostly used to communicate
	with PCs running DOS.

	The following questions deal with Ethernet boards from
	various vendors.  As more drivers are being developed,
	you are likely to see questions added to this section.
	If you want to build a kernel you can use on a number of
	different machines, you can enable more than one driver.

	Finally, in the filesystem section, the configuration script
	will ask you whether you want support for NFS, the
	networking filesystem.  NFS lets you export filesystems
	to several hosts, which makes the files appear as if they
	were on an ordinary hard disk attached to the host.
