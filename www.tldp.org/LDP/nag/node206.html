There are quite a number of options you may set in the config file,
which, although useful, are not essential to running smail, and
which we will not discuss here. Instead, we will only mention a
few that you might find a reason to use:
<DL><DT>error copy postmaster<DD>   If  this boolean variable is set, any error will
                generate a message to the postmaster.  Usually, this  is  only
                done  for  errors that are due to a faulty configuration.  The
                variable can be turned on by putting it in  the  config  file,
                preceded by a plus (+).

	<DT>max hop count<DD>   If the hop count for a message (i.e. the number of hosts
                already traversed) equals or exceeds this number, attempts  at
                remote delivery will result in an error message being returned
                to the sender. This is used to prevent messages  from  looping
                forever.  The  hop count is generally computed from the number
                of Received: fields in the mail header, but may  also  be  set
                manually using the -h option on the command line.
<P>

                     This variable defaults to 20.
	<DT>postmaster<DD>   The  postmaster's address. If the address Postmaster cannot be resolved to a valid local address, then this is used as the last resort. The default is root.
