LIBDIR defines the directory where sendmail+IDA expects to
find configuration files, the various dbm tables, and special local
definitions.  In a typical binary distribution, this is compiled into
the sendmail binary and does not need to be explicitly set in the
sendmail.m4 file.
<P>
The above example has a leading dnl which means that this line
is essentially a comment for information only.
<P>
To change the location of the support files to a different location,
remove the leading dnl from the above line, set the path to the
desired location, and rebuild and reinstall the sendmail.cf file.
