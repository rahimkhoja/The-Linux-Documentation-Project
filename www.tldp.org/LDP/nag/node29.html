This structure is reflected by splitting IP-addresses into a host and
network part, as explained above. By default, the destination network is
derived from the network part of the IP-address. Thus, hosts with
identical IP-network numbers should be found within the same network,
and vice versa.<A HREF="footnode.html#877"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
It makes sense to offer a similar scheme <em>inside</em> the network,
too, since it may consist of a collection of hundreds of smaller
networks itself, with the smallest units being physical networks like
Ethernets. Therefore, IP allows you to subdivide an IP-network into
several <em>subnets</em>.
<P>
A subnet takes over responsibility for delivering datagrams to a certain
range of IP-addresses from the IP-network it is part of.  As with
classes A, B, or C, it is identified by the network part of the
IP-addresses. However, the network part is now extended to include
some bits from the host part.  The number of bits that are interpreted
as the subnet number is given by the so-called <em>subnet mask</em>, or
<em>netmask</em>.  This is a 32-bit number, too, which specifies the bit
mask for the network part of the IP-address.

  Subnetting a class B network

The campus network of Groucho Marx University is an example of such a
network. It has a class-B network number of 149.76.0.0, and its
netmask is therefore 255.255.0.0.
<P>
Internally, GMU's campus network consists of several smaller networks,
such as the LANs of various departments. So the range of IP-addresses
is broken up into 254 subnets, 149.76.1.0 through
149.76.254.0.  For example, the Department of Theoretical
Physics has been assigned 149.76.12.0.  The campus backbone is
a network by its own right, and is given 149.76.1.0.  These
subnets share the same IP-network number, while the third octet is
used to distinguish between them.  Thus they will use a subnet mask of
255.255.255.0.
<P>
Figure <A HREF="node29.html#tcpipfigsubnet"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows how 149.76.12.4, the
address of quark, is interpreted differently when the address
is taken as an ordinary class-B network, and when used with
sub-netting.

It is worth noting that sub-netting (as the technique of generating
subnets is called) is only an <em>internal division</em> of the network.
Subnets are generated by the network owner (or the administrators).
Frequently, subnets are created to reflect existing boundaries, be they
physical (between two Ethernets), administrative (between two
departments), or geographical, and authority over these subnets is
delegated to some contact person. However, this structure affects only
the network's internal behavior, and is completely invisible to the
outside world.
