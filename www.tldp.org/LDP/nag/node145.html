Sometimes, it is wasteful to mount all NFS volumes users might possibly
want to access; either because of the sheer number of volumes to be
mounted, or because of the time this would take at startup. A viable
alternative to this is a so-called <em>automounter</em>. This is a daemon
that automatically and transparently mounts any NFS volume as needed,
and unmounts them after they have not been used for some time. One of
the clever things about an automounter is that it is able to mount a
certain volume from alternative places.  For instance, you may keep
copies of your X-programs and support files on two or three hosts, and
have all other hosts mount them via NFS.  Using an automounter, you may
specify all three of them to be mounted on /usr/X386; the
automounter will then try to mount any of these until one of the mount
attempts succeeds.
<P>
The automounter commonly used with  is called amd. It
was originally written by Jan-Simon Pendry and has been ported to
 by Rick Sladkey. The current version is amd-5.3.
<P>
Explaining amd is beyond the scope of this chapter; for
a good manual please refer to the sources; they contain a texinfo
file with very detailed information.
