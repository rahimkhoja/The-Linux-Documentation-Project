Most commonly, a local address is just a user's login name, in which case
the message is delivered to her mailbox, /var/spool/mail/user.
Other cases include aliases and mailing list names, and mail forwarding
by the user. In these cases, the local address expands to a new list
of addresses, which may be either local or remote.
<P>
Apart from these ``normal'' addresses, smail can handle other
types of local message destinations, like file names, and pipe commands.
These are not addresses in their own right, so you can't send mail
to, say, /etc/passwd@vbrew.com; they are only valid if they have 
been taken from forwarding or alias files.

A <em>file name</em> is anything that begins with a slash (/) or a
tilde ().  The latter refers to the user's home directory, and
is possible only if the filename was taken from a .forward file
or a forwarding entry in the mailbox (see below).  When delivering to a
file, smail appends the messages to the file, creating it if
necessary.

<A NAME="7611"></A>
A <em>pipe command</em> may be any  command preceded by the pipe
symbol (|). This causes smail to hand the command to the
shell along with its arguments, but without the leading `|'.  The
message itself is fed to this command on standard input.
<P>
For example, to gate a mailing list into a local newsgroup,
you might use a shell script named gateit, and set up
a local alias which delivers all messages from this mailing list
to the script using &quot;|gateit&quot;.
<P>
If the invocation contains white space, it has to be enclosed
in double quotes. Due to the security issues involved, care is taken not
to execute the command if the address has been obtained in a somewhat
dubious way (for example, if the alias file from which the address was
taken was writable by everyone).
