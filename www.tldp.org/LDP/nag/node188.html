<A NAME="maildelivery"></A>
Generally, you will compose mail using a mailer interface like mail
or mailx; or more sophisticated ones like elm, mush,
or pine. These programs are called <em>mail user agents</em>, or MUA's
for short. If you send a mail message, the interface program will in most
cases hand it to another program for delivery. This is called the
<em>mail transport agent</em>, or MTA. On some systems, there are different
mail transport agents for local and remote delivery; on others, there is
only one.  The command for remote delivery is usually called rmail,
the other is called lmail (if it exists).
<P>
Local delivery of mail is, of course, more than just appending the
incoming message to the recipient's mailbox. Usually, the local MTA
will understand aliasing (setting up local recipient addresses pointing
to other addresses), and forwarding (redirecting a user's mail to some
other destination). Also, messages that cannot be delivered must usually
be <em>bounced</em>, that is, returned to the sender along with some
error message.
<P>
For remote delivery, the transport software used depends on the nature
of the link.  If the mail must be delivered over a network using TCP/IP,
SMTP is commonly used.  SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,
and is defined in RFC-788 and RFC-821.  SMTP usually connects to the
recipient's machine directly, negotiating the message transfer with the
remote side's SMTP daemon.
<P>
In UUCP networks, mail will usually not be delivered directly, but
rather be forwarded to the destination host by a number of intermediate
systems. To send a message over a UUCP link, the sending MTA will
usually execute rmail on the forwarding system using uux,
and feed it the message on standard input.
<P>
Since this is done for each message separately, it may produce a
considerable work load on a major mail hub, as well as clutter the UUCP
spool queues with hundreds of small files taking up an unproportional
amount of disk space.<A HREF="footnode.html#6870"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> Some MTAs therefore allow you to collect several messages for a remote
system in a single batch file. The batch file contains the SMTP commands
that the local host would normally issue if a direct SMTP connection was
used.  This is called BSMTP, or <em>batched</em> SMTP. The batch is then
fed to the rsmtp or bsmtp program on the remote system,
which will process the input as if a normal SMTP connection had
occurred.
