To hide the diversity of equipment that may be used in a networking
environment, TCP/IP defines an abstract <em>interface</em> through which
the hardware is accessed. This interface offers a set of operations
which is the same for all types of hardware and basically deals with
sending and receiving packets.
<P>
For each peripheral device you want to use for networking, a
corresponding interface has to be present in the kernel. For example,
Ethernet interfaces in  are called eth0 and eth1,
and SLIP interfaces come as sl0, sl1, etc.  These
interface names are used for configuration purposes when you want to
name a particular physical device to the kernel. They have no meaning
beyond that.
<P>
To be usable for TCP/IP networking, an interface must be assigned an
IP-address which serves as its identification when communicating with the
rest of the world. This address is different from the interface name
mentioned above; if you compare an interface to door, then the address
is like the name-plate pinned on it.
<P>
Of course, there are other device parameters that may be set; one of
these is the maximum size of datagrams that can be processed by that
particular piece of hardware, also called <em>Maximum Transfer Unit</em>,
or MTU. Other attributes will be introduced later.
