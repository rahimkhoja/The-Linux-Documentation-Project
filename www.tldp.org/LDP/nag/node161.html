If the remote system is to be reached over a telephone line, the
phone field specifies the number the modem should dial.  It
may contain several tokens interpreted by uucico's dialing
procedure.  An equal sign means to wait for a secondary dial tone, and
a dash generates a one-second pause. For instance, some telephone
installations will choke when you don't pause between dialing the
prefix code and telephone number.

<B>[Don't know the proper English term for this-- you know,
something like a company's private internal installation where you
have to dial a 0 or 9 to get a line to the outside.]</B>

Any embedded alphabetic string may be used to hide site-dependent
information like area codes. Any such string is translated to a
dialcode using the dialcode file. Suppose you have the
following dialcode file:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
With these translations, you can use a phone number such as
Bogoham7732 in the sys file, which makes things probably
a little more legible.
