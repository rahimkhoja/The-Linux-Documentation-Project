After successfully setting up IP and the resolver, you have to turn to
the services you want to provide over the network. This chapter covers
the configuration of a few simple network applications, including the
inetd server, and the programs from the rlogin family.
The Remote Procedure Call interface that services like the Network File
System (NFS) and the Network Information System (NIS) are based upon
will be dealt with briefly, too. The configuration of NFS and NIS,
however, takes up more room, will be described in separate chapters.
This applies to electronic mail and netnews as well.
<P>
Of course, we can't cover all network applications in this book. If you
want to install one that's not discussed here, like talk,
gopher, or Xmosaic please refer to its manual pages for
details.
