Above, we already encountered the login chat script, which tells
uucico how to log into the remote system.  It consists of a list
of tokens, specifying strings expected and sent by the local
uucico process. The intention is to make uucico wait until
the remote machine sends a login prompt, then return the login name,
wait for the remote system to send the password prompt, and send the
password. Expect and send strings are given in alternation.
uucico automatically appends a carriage return character
(r) to any send string. Thus, a simple chat script would
look like
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
You will notice that the expect fields don't contain the whole prompts.
This is to make sure that the login succeeds even if the remote system
broadcasts Login: instead of login:.
<P>
uucico also allows for some sort of conditional execution, for
example in the case that the remote machine's getty needs to be
reset before sending a prompt. For this, you can attach a sub-chat to an
expect string, offset by a dash.  The sub-chat is executed only if the
main expect fails, i.e. a timeout occurs.  One way to use this feature
is to send a BREAK if the remote site doesn't display a login prompt.
The following example gives an allround chat script that should also
work in case you have to hit return before the login appears.
 tells UUCP to not wait for anything and continue with
the next send string immediately.

There are a couple of special strings and escape characters which may
occur in the chat script. The following is an incomplete list of
characters legal in expect strings:

On send strings, the following escape characters and strings are legal
in addition to the above:
