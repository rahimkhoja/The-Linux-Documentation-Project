There are rumors that there are some people out there in net-land who
only own one PC and don't have the money to spend on a T1-Internet link.
To get their daily dose of news and mail nevertheless, they are said to
rely on SLIP links, UUCP networks, and bulletin board systems (BBS's)
that utilize public telephone networks.
<P>
This chapter is intended to help all those people who rely on modems to
maintain their link. However, there are many details that this chapter
cannot go into, for instance how to configure your modem for dial-in. All
these topics will be covered in the upcoming Serial HOWTO by Greg
Hankins,<A HREF="footnode.html#2395"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> to be posted to comp.os.linux.announce on a regular basis.
