These commands are used to flip the serial line to SLIP mode
and configure the interface.
<P>
The mode command is the last command executed by dip
before gong into daemon mode. Unless an error occurs, the command
does not return.
<P>
mode takes a protocol name as argument. dip
currently recognizes SLIP and CSLIP as
valid names. The current version of dip does not understand
adaptive SLIP, however.
<P>
After enabling SLIP mode on the serial line, dip executes
ifconfig to configure the interface as a point-to-point link, and
invokes route to set the route to the remote host.
<P>
If, in addition, the script executes the default command
before mode, dip will also make the default
route point to the SLIP link.
