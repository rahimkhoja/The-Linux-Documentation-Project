<P>
Not every implementation of uucico speaks and understand each
protocol, so during the initial handshake phase, both processes have to
agree on a common protocol.  The master uucico offers the slave a
list of supported protocols by sending Pprotlist, from
which the slave may pick one.
<P>
Based on the type of port used (modem, TCP, or direct), uucico will
compose a default list of protocols. For modem and direct connections, this
list usually comprises <em>i</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>G</em>, and
<em>j</em>.  For TCP connections, the list is <em>t</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>i</em>,
<em>a</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>G</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>f</em>. You can override this
default list with the protocols command, which may be specified
in a system entry as well as a port entry. For instance, you might edit the
port file entry for your modem port like this:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
This will require any incoming or outgoing connection through this port
to use <em>i</em>, <em>g</em>, or <em>G</em>. If the remote system does not
support any of these, the conversation will fail.
