The settings from host.conf may be overridden using a number
of environment variables. These are
<dl>
<dt>      RESOLV HOST CONF <dd>This   specifies   a   file   to  be  read  instead  of
                /etc/host.conf.


<dt>      RESOLV SERV ORDER <dd>Overrides the order option given in  host.conf.   Services are given as hosts, bind, and nis, separated by a space,
                comma, colon, or semicolon.


<dt>      RESOLV SPOOF CHECK <dd>Determines the measures taken against spoofing. It is
                completely  disabled  by  off.   The  values warn and warn off
                enable spoof checking, but turn logging on  and  off,  respectively.  A  value  of  * turns on spoof checks, but leaves the
                logging facility as defined in host.conf.


<dt>RESOLV MULTI <dd>A value of <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> may be  used  to  override  the  multi options from tt host.conf.


<dt>      RESOLV OVERRIDE TRIM DOMAINS <dd>This  environment  specifies a list of trim
                domains which override those given in host.conf.


<dt>      RESOLV ADD TRIM DOMAINS <dd>This  environment  specifies  a  list  of   trim
                domains which are added to those given in host.conf.
