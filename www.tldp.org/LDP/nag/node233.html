When not using any of the optional dbm tables, sendmail+IDA delivers mail via
the DEFAULT_MAILER (and possibly RELAY_HOST and
RELAY_MAILER) defined in the sendmail.m4 file used to
generate sendmail.cf.  It is easily possible to override this behavior
through entries in the domaintable or uucpxtable.

A generic site that is on Internet and speaks Domain Name Service, or one
that is UUCP-only and forwards all mail via UUCP through a smart
RELAY_HOST, probably does not need any specific table entries at
all.
<P>
Virtually all systems should set the DEFAULT_HOST and
PSEUDONYMS macros, which define the canonical site name and aliases
it is known by, and DEFAULT_MAILER. If all you have is a relay
host and relay mailer, you don't need to set these defaults since it works
automagically.
<P>
UUCP hosts will probably also need to set UUCPNAME to their
official UUCP name.  They will also probably set RELAY_MAILER, and
RELAY_HOST which enable smart-host routing through a mail relay.
The mail transport to be used is defined in RELAY_MAILER and
should usually be UUCP-A for UUCP sites.
<P>
If your site is SMTP-only and talks `Domain Name Service', you would change
the DEFAULT_MAILER to TCP-A and probably delete the
RELAY_MAILER and RELAY_HOST lines.
