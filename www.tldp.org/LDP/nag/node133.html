If you are familiar with writing or porting network applications, you
will notice that most NIS maps listed above correspond to library
functions in the C-library. For instance, to obtain passwd
information, you generally use the getpwnam(3) and
getpwuid(3) functions which return the account information
associated with the given user name or numerical user id, respectively.
Under normal circumstances, these functions will perform the requested
lookup on the standard file, such as /etc/passwd.
<P>
A NIS-aware implementation of these functions, however, will modify this
behavior, and place an RPC call to have the NIS server look up the user
name or id. This happens completely transparent to the application.  The
function may either ``append'' the NIS map to or ``replace'' the
original file with it. Of course, this does not refer to a real
modification of the file, it only means that it <em>appears</em> to the
application as if the file had been replaced or appended to.
<P>
For traditional NIS implementations, there used to be certain
conventions as to which maps replaced, and which were appended to the
original information.  Some, like the passwd maps, required kludgy
modifications of the passwd file which, when done wrong, would
open up security holes. To avoid these pitfalls, NYS uses a general
configuration scheme that determines whether a particular set of client
functions uses the original files, NIS, or NIS+, and in which
order. It will be described in a later section of this chapter.
