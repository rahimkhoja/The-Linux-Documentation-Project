Throughout this book, we will mainly deal with installation and
configuration issues. Administration is, however, much more than that---.
After setting up a service, you have to keep it running, too.  For most of
them, only little attendance will be necessary, while some, like <A HREF="node186.html#SECTION0015">mail</A> and <A HREF="node255.html">news</A>, require that you perform routine tasks to keep your system up-to-date.  We will discuss these tasks in later chapters.
<P>
The absolute minimum in maintenance is to check system and per-application
log files regularly for error conditions and unusual events. Commonly, you
will want to do this by writing a couple of administrative shell scripts
and run them from <A HREF="../sag/node12.html">cron</a> periodically.  The source distribution of
some major applications, like <A HREF="node198.html#SECTION0016">smail</A> or <A HREF="node259.html">C-News</A>, contain such scripts.
You only have to tailor them to suit your needs and preferences.
<P>
The output from any of your cron jobs should be mailed to an
administrative account. By default, many applications will send error
reports, usage statistics, or logfile summaries to the root account.
This only makes sense if you log in as root frequently; a much
better idea is to forward root's mail to your personal account
setting up a mail alias as described in chapter-<A HREF="node198.html#smail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
However carefully you have configured your site, Murphy's law guarantees
that some problem <em>will</em> surface eventually. Therefore, maintaining a
system also means being available for complaints. Usually, people expect
that the system administrator can at least be reached via email as
root, but there are also other addresses that are commonly used to
reach the person responsible for a specific aspect of maintenance. For
instance, complaints about a malfunctioning mail configuration will usually
be addressed postmaster; and problems with the news system may be
reported to newsmaster or Usenet. Mail to
hostmaster should be redirected to the person in charge of the
host's basic network services, and the DNS name service if you run a name
server.
