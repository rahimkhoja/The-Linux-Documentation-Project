<P>
Starting with  1.1.14, which added alpha support for IPX,
the configuration procedure changed slightly. The general options section
now asks whether you want networking support in general. It is
immediately followed by a couple of question on miscellaneous
networking options.
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
	To use TCP/IP networking, you must answer this question with
	y. If you answer with n, however, you will still
	be able to compile the kernel with IPX support.

	You have to enable this option if your system acts as a
	gateway between two Ethernets, or between and Ethernet and a
	SLIP link, etc.  Although it doesn't hurt to enable this by
	default, you may want to disable this to configure a host as a
	so-called firewall. Firewalls are hosts that are connected to
	two or more networks, but don't route traffic between them.
	They are commonly used to provide users from a company network
	with Internet access at a minimal risk to the internal
	network. Users will be allowed to log into the firewall and
	use Internet services, but the company's machines will be
	protected from outside attacks because any incoming
	connections can't cross the firewall.

	This option works around an incompatibility with some versions
	of PC/TCP, a commercial TCP/IP implementation for DOS-based
	PCs. If you enable this option, you will still be able to
	communicate with normal  machines, but performance may
	be hurt over slow links.

	This function enables RARP, the Reverse Address Resolution
	Protocol. RARP is used by diskless clients and X-terminals to
	inquire their IP-address when booting.  You should enable RARP
	only when you plan to serve this sort of clients.  The latest
	package of network utilities (net-0.32d) contains a small
	utility named rarp that allows you to add systems to the
	RARP cache.

	When sending data over TCP, the kernel has to break up the
	stream into several packets before giving it to IP. For hosts
	that can be reached over a local network such as an Ethernet,
	larger packets will be used than for hosts where data has to
	go through long-distance links.<A HREF="footnode.html#1973"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> If you don't enable SNARL, the kernel will assume
	only those networks are local that it actually has an interface
	to. However, if you look at the class B network at Groucho
	Marx University, the whole class B network is local, but most
	hosts interface to only one or two subnets. If you enable
	SNARL, the kernel will assume <em>all</em> subnets
	are local and use large packets when talking to all hosts on
	campus.
<P>
	If you do want to use smaller packet sizes for data sent to
	specific hosts (because, for instance, the data goes through
	a SLIP link), you can do so using the mtu option of
	route, which is briefly discussed at the end of this
	chapter.

	Nagle's rule is a heuristic to avoid sending particularly
	small IP packets, also called tinygrams. Tinygrams are usually
	created by interactive networking tools that transmit single
	keystrokes, such as telnet or rsh. Tinygrams can
	become particularly wasteful on low-bandwidth links like SLIP.
	The Nagle algorithm attempts to avoid them by holding back
	transmission of TCP data briefly under some circumstances. You
	might only want to disable Nagle's algorithm if you have
	severe problems with packets getting dropped.

	This enables support for IPX, the transport protocol used by
	Novell Networking. It is still under development, and isn't
	really useful yet. One benefit of this will be that you can
	exchange data with IPX-based DOS utilities one day, and route
	traffic between your Novell-based networks through a PPP link.
	Support for the high-level protocols of Novell
	networking is however not in sight, as the specifications for
	these are available only at horrendous cost and under a
	non-disclosure agreement.
<P>
	Starting in the 1.1.16 kernel,  supports another
	driver type, the dummy driver.  The following question appears
	toward the start of the device driver section.
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
	The dummy driver doesn't really do much, but is quite useful 
	on standalone or SLIP hosts.  It is basically a masqueraded
	loopback interface. The reason to have this sort of interface
	is that on hosts that do SLIP but have no Ethernet, you want to
	have an interface that bears your IP address all the time.
	This is discussed in a little more detail in
