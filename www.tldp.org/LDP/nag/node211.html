The most common case for a local address is to denote a user's mailbox.
This mailbox is located in /var/spool/mail and has the name of the user.
It is owned by her, with a group of mail, and has mode 660.  If it
does not exist, it is created by smail.
<P>
Note that although /var/spool/mail is currently the standard place to
put the mailbox files, some mail software may have different paths
compiled in, for example /usr/spool/mail. If delivery to users
on your machine fails consistently, you should try if it helps to make
this a symbolic link to /var/spool/mail.
<P>
There are two addresses smail requires to exist:
MAILER-DAEMON and Postmaster. When generating a bounce
message for an undeliverable mail, a carbon copy is sent to the
postmaster account for examination (in case this might be due to
a configuration problem).  The MAILER-DAEMON is used as the
sender's address on the bounce message.
<P>
If these addresses do not name valid accounts on your system,
smail implicitly maps MAILER-DAEMON to postmaster,
and postmaster to root, respectively. You should usually
override this by aliasing the postmaster account to whoever is
responsible for maintaining the mail software.
