Just like SLIP, PPP is a protocol to send datagrams across a serial
connection, but addresses a couple of deficiencies of the former.  It
lets the communicating sides negotiate options such as the IP address
and the maximum datagram size at startup time, and provides for client
authorization.  For each of these capabilities, PPP has a separate
protocol.  Below, we will briefly cover these basic building blocks of
PPP. This discussion is far from complete; if you want to know more
about PPP, you are urged to read its specification in RFC-1548, as well
as the dozen or so companion RFCs.<A HREF="footnode.html#4068"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>

At the very bottom of PPP is the <em>High-Level Data Link Control</em>
Protocol, abbreviated HDLC,<A HREF="footnode.html#4071"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> which defines the boundaries around the individual PPP frames, and
provides a 16-bit checksum.  As opposed to the more primitive SLIP
encapsulation, a PPP frame is capable of holding packets from other
protocols than IP, such as Novell's IPX, or Appletalk. PPP achieves
this by adding a protocol field to the basic HDLC frame that
identifies the type of packet is carried by the frame.

LCP, the Link Control Protocol, is used on top of HDLC to negotiate
options pertaining to the data link, such as the Maximum Receive Unit
(MRU) that states the maximum datagram size one side of the link agrees
to receive.

An important step at the configuration stage of a PPP link is client
authorization. Although it is not mandatory, it is really a must for
dial-up lines.  Usually, the called host (the server) asks the client to
authorize itself by proving it knows some secret key.  If the caller fails
to produce the correct secret, the connection is terminated.  With PPP,
authorization works both ways; that is, the caller may also ask the server
to authenticate itself.  These authentication procedures are totally
independent of each other.  There are two protocols for different types of
authorization, which we will discuss further below.  They are named
Password Authentication Protocol, or PAP, and Challenge Handshake
Authentication Protocol, or CHAP.

Each network protocol that is routed across the data link, like IP,
AppleTalk, etc, is configured dynamically using a corresponding Network
Control Protocol (NCP).  For instance, to send IP datagrams across the
link, both PPPs must first negotiate which IP-address each of them uses.
The control protocol used for this is IPCP, the Internet Protocol Control
Protocol.

Beside sending standard IP-datagrams across the link, PPP also supports
Van-Jacobson header compression of IP-datagrams. This is a technique to
shrink the headers of TCP packets to as little as three bytes. It is
also used in CSLIP, and is more colloquially referred to as VJ-header
compression.  The use of compression may be negotiated at startup time
through IPCP as well.
