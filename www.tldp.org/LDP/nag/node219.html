It's been said that you aren't a <em>real</em> Unix system administrator until
you've edited a sendmail.cf file.  It's also been said that you're
crazy if you've attempted to do so twice:-)
<P>
Sendmail is an incredibly powerful program.  It's also incredibly difficult
to learn and understand for most people.  Any program whose definitive
reference (<em>Sendmail</em>, published by O'Reilly and Associates) is 792 pages
long quite justifiably scares most people off.

Sendmail+IDA is different.  It removes the need to edit the always cryptic
sendmail.cf file and allows the administrator to define the
site-specific routing and addressing configuration through relatively easy to
understand support files called <em>tables</em>.  Switching to sendmail+IDA can
save you many hours of work and stress.
<P>
Compared to the other major mail transport agents, there is probably nothing
that can't be done faster and simpler with sendmail+IDA.  Typical things that
are needed to run a normal UUCP or Internet site become simple to accomplish.
Configurations that normally are extremely difficult are simple to create and
maintain.
<P>
At this writing, the current version of sendmail5.67b+IDA1.5 is
available via anonymous FTP from vixen.cso.uiuc.edu.  It compiles
without any patching required under .
<P>
All the configuration files required to get sendmail+IDA sources to compile,
install, and run under  are included in newspak-2.2.tar.gz
which is available via anonymous FTP on sunsite.unc.edu in the
directory /pub/Linux/system/Mail.
