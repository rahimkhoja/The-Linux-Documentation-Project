In the meanwhile, Fred continued development, going on to Net-2e, which
features a much revised design of the networking layer.  At the time of
writing, Net-2e is still Beta software.  Most notable about Net-2e is
the incorporation of DDI, the <em>Device Driver Interface</em>.  DDI offers
a uniform access and configuration method to all networking devices and
protocols.
<P>
Yet another implementation of TCP/IP networking comes from Matthias
Urlichs, who wrote an ISDN driver for Linux and FreeBSD. For this,
he integrated some of the BSD networking code in the  kernel.
<P>
For the foreseeable future, however, Net-3 seems to be here to stay.
Alan currently works on an implementation of the AX.25 protocol used
by ham radio amateurs. Doubtlessly, the yet to be developed ``module''
code for the kernel will also bring new impulses to the networking
code. Modules allow you to add drivers to the kernel at run time.
<P>
Although these different network implementations all strive to provide
the same service, there are major differences between them at the
kernel and device level.  Therefore, you will not be able to configure
a system running a Net-2e kernel with utilities from Net-2d or Net-3,
and vice versa. This only applies to commands that deal with kernel
internals rather closely; applications and common networking commands
such as rlogin or telnet run on either of them.
<P>
Nevertheless, all these different network version should not worry you.
Unless you are participating in active development, you will not have to
worry about which version of the TCP/IP code you run. The official
kernel releases will always be accompanied by a set of networking tools
that are compatible with the networking code present in the kernel.
