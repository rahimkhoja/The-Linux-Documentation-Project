<P>
dip only understands a predefined set of variables. A
variable name always begins with a dollar symbol and must be
written in lower-case letters.
<P>
The $local and $locip variables contain
the local host's name and IP-address. Setting the hostname makes
dip store the canonical hostname in $local,
at the same time assigning $locip the corresponding
IP-address. The analogous thing happens when setting the 
$locip.
<P>
The $remote and $rmtip variables do the same for
the remote host's name and address.  $mtu contains the MTU
value for the connection.
<P>
These five variables are the only ones that may be assigned values
directly using the get command. A host of other variables can
only be set through corresponding commands, but may be used
print statements; these are $modem, $port,
and $speed.
<P>
$errlvl is the variable through which you can access the
result of the last command executed. An error level of 0 indicates
success, while a non-zero value denotes an error.
