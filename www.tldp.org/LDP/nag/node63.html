If you configure the networking software on your host for standalone
operation (for instance, to be able to run the INN netnews software),
you can safely skip this section, because you will need an IP-address
just for the loopback interface, which is always 127.0.0.1.
<P>
Things are a little more complicated with real networks like Ethernets.
If you want to connect your host to an existing network, you have to ask
its administrators to give you an IP-address on this network.  When
setting up the network all by yourself, you have to assign IP-addresses
yourself as described below.
<P>
Hosts within a local network should usually share addresses from the
same logical IP-network. Hence you have to assign an IP-network address.
If you have several physical networks, you either have to assign them
different network numbers, or use sub-netting to split your IP-address
range into several subnetworks.
<P>
If your network is not connected to the Internet, you are free to choose
any (legal) network address. You only have to make sure to choose one from
classes A, B, or C, else things will most likely not work properly.
However, if you intend to get on the Internet in the near future, you
should obtain an official IP-address <em>now</em>. The best way to proceed is
to ask your network service provider to help you.  If you want to obtain a
network number just in case you might get on the Internet someday, request
a Network Address Application Form from hostmaster@internic.net.
<p>
To operate several Ethernets (or other networks, once a driver is
available), you have to split your network into subnets. Note that
sub-netting is required only if you have more than one <em>broadcast
network</em>; point-to-point links don't count. For instance, if you have
one Ethernet, and one or more SLIP links to the outside world, you
don't need to subnet your network. The reason for this will be
explained in chapter-<A HREF="node92.html#slip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
As an example, the brewery's network manager applies to the NIC for a
class B network number, and is given 191.72.0.0.  To accommodate
the two Ethernets, she decides to use eight bits of the host part as
additional subnet bits. This leaves another eight bits for the host
part, allowing for 254 hosts on each of the subnets. She then assigns
subnet number 1 to the brewery, and gives the winery number 2. Their
respective network addresses are thus 191.72.1.0 and
191.72.2.0. The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.
<P>
vlager, which is the gateway between the two networks, is assigned a
host number of 1 on both of them, which gives it the IP-addresses
191.72.1.1 and 191.72.2.1, respectively.
Figure-<A HREF="node64.html#interfacefigsubnet"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows the two subnets, and the gateway.
<P>
Note that in this example I am using a class B network to keep things
simple; a class C network would be more realistic.  With the new networking
code, sub-netting is not limited to byte boundaries, so even a class C
network may be split into several subnets. For instance, you could use 2
bits of the host part for the netmask, giving you four possible subnets
with 64 hosts on each.<A HREF="footnode.html#2589"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
