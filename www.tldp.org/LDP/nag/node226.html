Many sites find that it is important to ensure that mail is sent and received
with close to a 100% success rate.  While examining syslogd(8) logs
is helpful, the local mail administrator generally needs to see the headers
on bounced mail in order to determine if the mail was undeliverable because
of user error or a configuration error on one of the systems involved.
<P>
Defining POSTMASTERBOUNCE results in a copy of each bounced message
being set to the person defined as Postmaster for the system.
<P>
Unfortunately, setting this parameter also results in the <em>text</em> of the
message being sent to the Postmaster, which potentially has related privacy
concerns for people using mail on the system.
<P>
Site postmasters should in general attempt to discipline themselves (or do so
via technical means through shell scripts that delete the text of the bounce
messages they receive) from reading mail not addressed to them.
