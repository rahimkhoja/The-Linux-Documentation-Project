smail currently supports an SMTP driver to deliver mail over
TCP connections.<A HREF="footnode.html#7845"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> It is capable of delivering a message to any number of addresses on
one single host, with the hostname being specified as either a fully
qualified domain name that can be resolved by the networking software,
or in dotted quad notation enclosed in square brackets.  Generally,
addresses resolved by any of the BIND, gethostbyname(3), or
gethostbyaddr(3) router drivers will be delivered to the SMTP
transport.
<P>
The SMTP driver will attempt to connect to the remote host immediately
through the smtp port as listed in /etc/services.  If
it cannot be reached, or the connection times out, delivery will be
re-attempted at a later time.
<P>
Delivery on the Internet requires that routes to the destination host be
specified in the <em>route-addr</em> format described in
chapter-<A HREF="node186.html#mail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, rather than as a bang path.<A HREF="footnode.html#7744"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> smail will therefore transform user%host@gateway,
where gateway is reached via host1!host2!host3, into the
source-route address &lt;@host2,@host3:user%host@gateway&gt; which
will be sent as the message's envelope address to host1.  To
enable these transformation (along with the built-in BIND driver), you
have to edit the entry for the smtp driver in the
transports file.  A sample transports file is given in
Appendix-<A HREF="node285.html#appendixsmail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
