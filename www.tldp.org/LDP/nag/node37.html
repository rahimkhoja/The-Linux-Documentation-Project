At first glance, all this domain and zone fuss seems to make name
resolution an awfully complicated business. After all, if no central
authority controls what names are assigned to which hosts, then how is a
humble application supposed to know?!
<P>
Now comes the really ingenuous part about DNS. If you want to find
out the IP-address of erdos, then, DNS says, go ask the people
that manage it, and they will tell you.

In fact, DNS is a giant distributed database. It is implemented by means
of so-called name servers that supply information on a given domain or
set of domains. For each zone, there are at least two, at most a few,
name servers that hold all authoritative information on hosts in that
zone. To obtain the IP-address of erdos, all you have to do is
contact the name server for the groucho.edu zone, which will then
return the desired data.

Easier said than done, you might think. So how do I know how to reach
the name server at Groucho Marx University? In case your computer isn't
equipped with an address-resolving oracle, DNS provides for this, too.
When your application wants to look up information on erdos, it
contacts a local name server, which conducts a so-called iterative query
for it.  It starts off by sending a query to a name server for the root
domain, asking for the address of erdos.maths.groucho.edu. The root
name server recognizes that this name does not belong to its zone of
authority, but rather to one below the edu domain. Thus, it tells
you to contact an edu zone name server for more information, and
encloses a list of all edu name servers along with their addresses.
Your local name server will then go on and query one of those, for instance
a.isi.edu.  In a manner similar to the root name server,
a.isi.edu knows that the groucho.edu people run a zone of
their own, and point you to their servers. The local name server will then
present its query for erdos to one of these, which will finally
recognize the name as belonging to its zone, and return the corresponding
IP-address.
<P>
Now, this looks like a lot of traffic being generated for looking up a
measly IP-address, but it's really only miniscule compared to the amount
of data that would have to be transferred if we were still stuck with
HOSTS.TXT. But there's still room for improvement with this
scheme.
<P>
To improve response time during future queries, the name server will
store the information obtained in its local <em>cache</em>.  So the next
time anyone on your local network wants to look up the address of a
host in the groucho.edu domain, your name server will not have
to go through the whole process again, but will rather go to the
groucho.edu name server directly.<A HREF="footnode.html#1590"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>

Of course, the name server will not keep this information forever, but
rather discard it after some period. This expiry interval is called the
<em>time to live</em>, or TTL. Each datum in the DNS database is assigned
such a TTL by administrators of the responsible zone.
