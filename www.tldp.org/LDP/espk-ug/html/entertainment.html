>One note about volume in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>: in my tests, I found that often the system volume would go way down when I started <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, to the point where I could barely hear it. If I exited <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, the volume in Emacspeak would continue to be extremely low, regardless of how it was set before I started <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>.  However, if I turned up the volume while in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, not only was it at an acceptable level in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>, it was also loud after I quit <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Another problem that I noticed when using <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
> is that sometimes when you quit the application, it doesn't seem to relinquish control of the sound card. You'll see evidence of this behavior if you try to play a CD or restart <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
> - you'll get an error message saying that your sound card is busy or that it's not installed correctly. If you check the list of open Emacs buffers, you'll see that <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>mpg123</SPAN
> is still there, although it's apparently in a questionable state. I have not yet figured out how to remedy this problem; if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know so it can be added to the HOWTO. </P

>If you find yourself listening to a lot of MP3s, there is an mp3 jukebox written by Karl Dahlke available at <A
HREF="http://www.eklhad.net/linux/app/jukebox"

>If you want to rip your own MP3s, under Linux it is a two step process.  The first step is to convert the tracks on an audio CD to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.wav</TT
> format, then convert the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.wav</TT
> files to MP3s. There is a great web page by Nathan Robertson on how to do this, located at <A
