  and physics at the University of Melbourne. His main interests in each 
  area are in Operating Systems and Quantum Mechanics respectively.
  </P
><P
>&#13;  His background is strongly biased towards science and mathematics. 
  Nonetheless, he does have an appreciation for the arts, humanities 
  and sport. A reasonably proficient musician (flute), he is currently 
  pondering whether he should complete his musical studies to obtain a 
  diploma so that he can teach. In high school, he was a member of the 
  athletics, basketball, football, cricket and swimming squads. He speaks 
  English predominately but is also able to communicate in Vietnamese and 
  French. When younger he also possessed the ability to communicate in 
  Chinese and Italian.

>&#13;  Although brought up as a Buddhist and studying at Catholic/Christian 
  schools all his life as well as studying scripture during his final year of 
  high school he considers himself an atheist.
  </P
><P
>&#13;  At this moment in time, he works part-time as a (commercial) 
  researcher/developer on Linux related projects with his current 
  focus being on software distribution mechanisms.

  Hierarchy", <A
