>&#13;A microprocessor clock cycle in which nothing at all occurs. A wait state is programmed into a computer system to allow other components, such as random-access memory (RAM), to catch up with the central processing unit (CPU). The number of wait states depends on the speed of the processor in relation to the speed of memory. Wait states can be eliminated-resulting in a zero wait states machine by using fast (but expensive) cache memory, interfaced memory, page-mode , or static chips. From QUECID

</B

><P
>&#13;n. 1. A file containing a listing (e.g., assembly listing) or a transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of all or part of a login session. (The idea was that the paper for such listings was essentially good only for wallpaper, as evidenced at Stanford, where it was used to cover windows.) Now rare, esp. since other systems have developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). However, the Unix world doesn't have an equivalent term, so perhaps wallpaper will take hold there. The term probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end transcript files were :WALBEG and :WALEND, with default file WALL PAPER (the space was a path delimiter). 2. The background pattern used on graphical workstations (this is techspeak under the `Windows' graphical user interface to MS-DOS). 3. `wallpaper file' n. The file that contains the wallpaper information before it is actually printed on paper. (Even if you don't intend ever to produce a real paper copy of the file, it is still called a wallpaper file.)  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Warewulf is a unique Linux distribution for cluster nodes. It facilitates a central administration model for all nodes and includes tools needed to build configuration files, monitor, and control the nodes. It is totally customizable and can be adapted to just about any type of cluster. The node distributions are built from a virtual node filesystem residing on the master, transfered to the nodes either by Etherboot or CDROM images, and run from RAM. Administration is scalable and easy. It was originally designed for Beowulf, but can be used in other environments as well. The initial version, 0.3, was released March 11, 2002. Version 1.11 was released May 15, 2003. A 'special purpose/mini' distribution. From LWN Distribution List

>&#13;A non-interactive FTP client for updating web pages Weex is an utility designed to automate the task of remotely maintaining a web page or other FTP archive. With weex, the maintainer of a web site or archive that must be administered through FTP interaction can largely ignore that process. The archive administrator simply creates a local directory that serves as an exact model for the off-site data. All modifications and direct interaction is done locally to this directory structure. When the administrator wishes to coordinate the data on the remote site with that of the local model directory, simply executing weex accomplishes this in the most bandwidth-efficient fashion by only transferring files that need updating. The program will create or remove (!) files or directories as necessary to accurately establish the local model on the remote server. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;retrieves files from the web Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot. Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has. Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls. http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;n. A privilege bit that allows the possessor to perform some restricted operation on a timesharing system, such as read or write any file on the system regardless of protections, change or look at any address in the running monitor, crash or reload the system, and kill or create jobs and user accounts. The term was invented on the TENEX operating system, and carried over to TOPS-20, XEROX-IFS, and others. The state of being in a privileged logon is sometimes called `wheel mode'. This term entered the Unix culture from TWENEX in the mid-1980s and has been gaining popularity there (esp. at university sites). See also root.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;[coined in a paper by T. H. Myer and I.E. Sutherland "On the Design of Display Processors", Comm. ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job, then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again. Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in communications and floating-point processors. Also known as `the Wheel of Life', `the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological idea. See also blitter, bit bang.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Automatically reconfigure your (laptop) system for a new location whereami is a set of useful scripts and a coordinating system for automatically re-locating your computer within the current (network) environment. Typically, you would use whereami to automatically detect and re-configure your laptop when you move between a variety of diverse networks and/or docking environments. Although whereami will work best if all of your networks assign addresses through dhcp, this is not a pre-requisite and the system allows any technique to be used to ascertain the new location with as little ongoing user intervention as possible. Having ascertained the correct location, whereami will run appropriate (user-configured) scripts to adjust the laptop operation to suit the current environment. See http://debiana.net/whereami/ for more information.  You may also get useful assistance from the debian-laptop mailing list, which is frequented by several of the contributors.

>&#13;Wiki is a piece of server software that allows users to freely create and edit Web page content using any Web browser. Wiki supports hyperlinks and has a simple text syntax for creating new pages and crosslinks between internal pages on the fly. Wiki is unusual among group communication mechanisms in that it allows the organization of contributions to be edited in addition to the content itself. Like many simple concepts, "open editing" has some profound and subtle effects on Wiki usage. Allowing everyday users to create and edit any page in a Web site is exciting in that it encourages democratic use of the Web and promotes content composition by nontechnical users. Historical Note. The first ever wiki site was created for the Portland Pattern Repository in 1995. That site now hosts tens of thousands of pages. From Wiki

>&#13;Window Maker is an X11 window manager which emulates the look and feel of the NeXTSTEP (TM) graphical user interface. It is relatively fast, feature rich and easy to configure and use. Window Maker is part of the official GNU project, which means that Window Maker can interoperate with other GNU projects, such as GNOME. Window Maker allows users to switch themes 'on the fly,' to place favorite applications on either an application dock, similar to AfterStep's Wharf or on a workspace dock, a 'clip' which extends the application dock's usefulness.

But  if you  switch the  mode to  e-mail mode or NetNews mode, they break your favorite style.

>&#13;Erased data can frequently be retrieved through forensics on the magnetic material of a hard-disk drive or backup tape. So-called "magnetoresistive microscopes" have been developed that painstakingly scour magnetic media, and are able to reconstruct the magnetic image of a disk surface. This will show the faint residue of overwritten data. A common security measure is to "wipe" all traces of the data from a machine. Wiping usually involves: Clearing caches and logfiles. Example include browser caches, cookie files, history logs, and recently used document lists. Note that passwords are often stored in cookies and history URLs. Hard-disks "erase" files by simply removing their entries from the directory. The files still exist on the hard-disk. The first step of wiping is to actually erase them by overwriting that area of the disk. Overwriting erased areas of the hard-disk at least 7-times with different bytes (DoD spec) in order to remove all magnetic traces. Forensics specialists can usually read data from a disk that has been overwritten only once. Wiping the pagefile. Most programs do this by repeated allocating all possible memory in the system then freeing it, multiple times. Contrast: Wiping data from the disk is the electronic equivalent of shredding. It is not as strong as degaussing the disk. Misconception: Many crypto programs also contain a feature for wiping free-space. However, deleted files may be overwritten by some other file between wiping passes. This deleted file won't be wiped, and may be recoverable. Key point: In a court case in 2001, the FBI was able to successful retrieve overwritten files from a defendant's hard-drive. History: Microsoft's Windows XP, shipped in October of 2001, contains an automatic wipe feature for permanently deleting files. This has made some forensics investigators worried that they will no longer be able to successfully retrieve deleted files from dumb-criminal's machines. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Secure file deletion Recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is easier than what many people would like to believe. A technique called Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) allows any moderately funded opponent to recover the last two or three layers of data written to disk. Wipe repeatedly writes special patterns to the files to be destroyed, using the fsync() call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access. Homepage: http://gsu.linux.org.tr/wipe/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Secure and efficient http server with advanced features. WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1).  Its primary design goals are security and functionality usually available only with complex CGI scripts without the necessity of writing or using these scripts.  This includes extensive security checks, full text searching and conditionally served text. Despite this extensive functionality the WN executable is substantially smaller than the CERN or NCSA servers.  Both a stand-alone daemon and a version intended for use under inetd are provided.  The inetd version is designed to minimize the use of system resources and it is appropriate for moderate or lightly loaded servers which cannot be totally dedicated to Web serving. WN's security model is based on the use of a small flat database in each directory with information about the files in that directory.  Fields associated with a file include its title, and may include keywords, expiration date and any user defined fields like author or document id.  Unlike other servers, the default action for WN is to deny access to a file.  A file can only be served if explicit permission to do so has been granted by entering it in this database.

"The code died on NUL characters in the input, so I fixed it to interpret them as spaces." "That's not a fix, that's a workaround!" 2. A procedure to be employed by the user in order to do what some currently non-working feature should do.

>&#13;Keep Track of Time worked on Projects From the author: Worklog is a program that helps you keep track of your time.  I wrote this program because I have several projects that require me to keep a timesheet.  I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing miscellaneous administrative tasks.  Rather than invoke an editor on a timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two keystrokes the onset or change of any given task.  Worklog is a simple ncurses based program to do just that. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;worm
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A program that propagates itself by attacking other machines and copying itself to them. Example: In the late 1980s, the Morris Worm shutdown the Internet for a couple of days. At the time, well-known bugs in the UNIX sendmail program could allow a hacker to break into machines. Robert T. Morris wrote a program that would san machines for these security holes, then break into the machine. After breaking in, the program would copy itself up to that machine, then launch it. In this manner, the worm spread from machine to machine, multiplying until it had broken into nearly every machine which contained these bugs. However, the worm itself had a bug where it couldn't detect that a machine had already been broken into. Therefore, it would repeatedly break into the same machine over and over, until it machine collapsed from running too many instances of the worm. Copycats of the Morris Worm pop up repeatedly as new security holes appear in popular systems (like Linux), but they never have the devastating effect of the Morris Worm. Example: In the late 1999, the Melissa Worm/Virus nearly disabled the Internet. The worm spread by e-mailing itself to the first 50 people in a user's e-mail address book. Victims would then receive an e-mail from somebody they knew and trusted, so they would open the attached document and run the macros. In this manner, Melissa spread from inbox to inbox. Melissa is sort of a cross between a virus and a worm: it had the ability to spread itself like a worm, but it still required user interaction. Example: Around 1998, the ADMworm traveled by exploiting a few well-known Linux vulnerabilities in Linux machines, breaking into the machine, installing itself, then hunting for more machines.  Example: Having failed to learn their lesson in 1999, the industry was pummeled by the ILOVEYOU worm in early 2000. It spread in much the same way, though this time it was a VBS script rather than an .exe. Contrast: There really is not difference between a worm and a virus. The dividing line is usually drawn along the amount of human interaction involved, and how it spreads from machine to machine. A worm spreads itself with zero human interaction, whereas a virus is spread by human contact: humans exchange files from machine to machine, and when a human runs the infected program, the virus only infects other files on the same machine. Some viruses do attack servers, but only because the user is connected to the server. The Melissa Virus/Worm crosses the line: it spreads from one machine to another like a worm, but it must be launched by the user like a virus. Example: The SirCam Worm of July 2001 didn't explode as fast as other viruses, but had a large effect on the net through its "background" operation on a machine and the technique of spidering the cached files in web-browsers looking for e-mail addresses.

>&#13;n. The obvious antonym to `read-only memory'. Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved. This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics management only when regular customers started calling and asking for pricing information. Signetics published a corrected edition of the data book and requested the return of the `erroneous' ones. Later, in 1972, Signetics bought a double-page spread in "Electronics" magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April Fools' Day joke. Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included diagrams of "bit capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins remaining vs. number of socket insertions", and "AQL vs. selling price". The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, +/- 2%.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;powerful and widely used FTP server This FTP daemon, originally from the Washington University of St. Louis, is a powerful, and widely used replacement FTP server for Unix systems. The FTP protocol is a method of transferring files between machines on a network and/or over the Internet. Besides fully supporting the FTP protocol defined in RFCs 959 and 1579 (and others), it adds the following features:     o  logging of transfers,     o  logging of commands,     o  on the fly compression and archiving,     o  classification of users on type and location,     o  per class limits,     o  per directory upload permissions,     o  restricted guest accounts,     o  system wide and per directory messages,     o  directory aliases,     o  cdpath,     o  filename filter,     o  virtual host support (similar to the Apache HTTP server). This release is maintained by the WU-FTPD Development Group as a public service to the Internet. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;/wiz'ee-ayg/ adj. Describes a user interface under which "What You See Is All You Get"; an unhappy variant of WYSIWYG. Visual, `point-and-shoot'-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves, but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be better served by a command-style interface. When this happens, the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG `desktop publishing' programs, for example, are a clear win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them, especially things like newsletters and presentation slides. When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like TeX or Unix's troff becomes not just desirable but a necessity. Compare YAFIYGI. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;/wiz'ee-wig/ adj. [Traced to Flip Wilson's "Geraldine" character c.1970] Describes a user interface under which "What You See Is What You Get", as opposed to one that uses more-or-less obscure commands that do not result in immediate visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple fonts or graphics is a a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants of this term to express real-world manifestations including WYSIAWYG (What You See Is Almost What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to refer to dumbed-down user-friendly interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure commands (compare WYSIAYG). On the other hand, EMACS was one of the very first WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely obscure, command-based TECO. See also WIMP environment. [Oddly enough, WYSIWYG has already made it into the OED, in lower case yet. --ESR] From Jargon Dictionary
