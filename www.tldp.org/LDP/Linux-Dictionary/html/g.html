Gadfly stores the active database in memory, with recovery logging to a file system. It supports an optional TCP/IP based client server mode and log based failure recovery for system or software failures (but not for disk failures). kwParser, included as part of the Gadfly package, is a parser generator for Python.  It transforms an abstract specification of a language grammar (for example the CORBA Interface Definition Language) together with "interpretation functions" that define the semantics of the language into a compiler or translator or interpreter.

>&#13;[Chemistry] a free molecular visualization program Garlic is probably the most portable molecular visualization program in the Unix world. It's written for the investigation of membrane proteins. It may be used to visualize other proteins, as well as some geometric objects. The name should has something to do with the structure and operation of this program. This version of garlic recognizes PDB format version 2.1. Garlic may also be used to analyze protein sequences. Features include (but not limited to):  o The slab position and thickness are visible in a small window.  o Atomic bonds as well as atoms are treated as independent drawable    objects.  o The atomic and bond colors depend on position. Five mapping modes    are available (as for slab).  o Capable to display stereo image.  o Capable to display other geometric objects, like membrane.  o Atomic information is available for atom covered by the mouse    pointer. No click required, just move the mouse pointer over the    structure!  o Capable to load more than one structure.  o Capable to draw Ramachandran plot, helical wheel, Venn diagram,    averaged hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment plot.  o The command prompt is available at the bottom of the main window.    It is able to display one error message and one command string. Author:  Damir Zucic (zucic@pref.etfos.hr), University of Osijek, Croatia.

>&#13;small numeric base converter If you specify a number on the command line (preceded by a switch to describe the base the number is in) the program will display that number in all four bases on the console and exit. You can also specify the -s switch which will allow you to enter/display signed numbers. (This allows the use of a - (minus) before a decimal number). Just running the program without any switches will display the main window. There are four entry boxes, corresponding to each of the four bases. You can type into any of these boxes and the others will update automagically. The program will ignore any characters that are not allowed for that particular base. It will only allow a - (minus) at the start of a decimal number, if the signed option is on. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

It will also highlight the mailboxes which have new mail. Pressing the left mouse button on a mailbox with new mail will display the Sender and Subject of each new message. Additionally, GBuffy will display the X-Face header for messages which have them. Pressing the middle mouse button on a mailbox will launch the configured command, generally a command to read the mailbox with your favorite mailreader. Pressing the right mouse button will bring up the configure menu. GBuffy is currently capable of watching MBOX, MMDF, Maildir and MH Folders.

Apart from the usual and well known calendar functions like the output of a month or a year calendar sheet, or the output of an eternal holiday list, Gcal offers the facility to display fixed dates on the day of their occurrence and to remind or inform the user about them.

>&#13;Global Consciousness Project EGG Software The GCP studies data from random event generators in widely distributed locations, to discern non-random patterns that may result from the interaction of human consciousness with the generators. This package provides the software required to operate a random event generator and return data to the project.  Unless you are registered with the GCP and have received event generator hardware, this package will be useless to you.  If you have no idea what this means, don't bother installing this package!

>&#13;Gem Drop X is an interesting one-player puzzle game for X11 The game is played with YOU at the bottom of the screen.  At the top is a random assortment of colored shapes ("gems").  As time goes on, more gems appear at the very top of the screen, pushing the rest downwards.  The game is over when the gems reach the bottom. It's your job to keep the screen from filling up.  You do this by "grabbing" gems from the top of the screen, carrying them around, if need be, and "throwing" them back up. If, when you throw some gems back up, you create a "match" of 3 or more gems in a vertical column, they disappear (with a cool little explosion). At this point, if there are any "matches" of the same gem to the left or right of this column, they disappear too!  And so on.  This is great for cool chain-reactions! You also get more points for the more gems that disappear in a match.  (Matching four gives as many points as matching three twice, for example.) From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;General-purpose neural simulator GENESIS is a general purpose simulation platform which was developed to support the simulation of neural systems ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract neuronal components. GENESIS has provided the basis for laboratory courses in neural simulation at both Caltech and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. Most current GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and similar connectionist modeling. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Geomview allows multiple independently controllable objects and cameras.  It provides interactive control for motion, appearances (including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an object, edge or vertex level, snapshots in SGI image file or Renderman RIB format, and adding or deleting objects is provided through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing interactive control of everything else.

>&#13;A font viewer for Type 1 and TrueType fonts gfontview is a font viewer for outline fonts, PostScript(tm) Type 1 and TrueType(tm). gfontview allows you to display a particular character or string of a font in an own window, thus allowing a comparison between several fonts with a particular string sample. This character or string can be antialiased (smoothed). The string can also consider the kerning pairs if available in the AFM or TTF file. The displayed character or string can be saved in GIF format. A table with all glyphs in the font (for PostScript Type 1 fonts also in several encodings) can also be created. A custom encoding will be generated on the fly to allow you to see all characters (also not encoded ones) in a Type 1 font, the so called "Custom" encodings. You can also print a sample of a font. The program generates PostScript code with sample strings in several sizes, which you can download to any PostScript printer or to ghostscript. TrueType fonts can be saved as Type42 PostScript fonts.

>&#13;GNU Forth Language Environment This is the GNU'ish implementation of a Forth programming environment. Forth, as a language, is best known for being stack-based, and completely extensible.  Each Forth environment provides one or more dictionaries of pre-defined words, and programming in Forth consists of defining and executing new words that are combinations of previously defined words.  It has been said that learning Forth changes forever the way you think about writing programs.

Geometry optimization, molecular dynamics and a large set of visualization tools using OpenGL are currently available. Ghemical relies on external code to provide the quantum-mechanical calculations.  Semi-empirical methods MNDO, MINDO/3, AM1 and PM3 come from the MOPAC7 package (Public Domain), and are included in the package. The project started as a freeware molecular modelling package, but since the graphical user interface part of the package is quite advanced and clearly written (according to our own biased view, at least), the package now aims to become a common framework for molecular modelling programs generally.

>&#13;The GIMP is an image manipulation program suitable for photo retouching,image composition and image authoring.  Many people find it extremely useful in creating logos and other graphics for web pages.  The GIMP has many of the tools and filters you would expect to find in similar commercial offerings, and some interesting extras as well. The GIMP provides a large image manipulation toolbox, including channel operations and layers, effects, sub-pixel imaging and anti-aliasing, and conversions, all with multi-level undo. This version of The GIMP includes a scripting facility, but many of the included scripts rely on fonts that we cannot distribute. The GIMP ftpsite has a package of fonts that you can install by yourself, which includes all the fonts needed to run the included scripts.  Some of the fonts have unusual licensing requirements; all the licenses are documented in the package.  Get ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/fonts/freefonts-0.10.tar.gzand ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/fonts/sharefonts-0.10.tar.gz if you are soinclined.  Alternatively, choose fonts which exist on your system before running the scripts. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

>&#13;There are many ways to describe a Geographic Information System. Here are three working definitions (from David A. Hastings, 1992, Geographic Information Systems: A Tool for Geoscience Analysis and Interpretation): (The minimal definition): A GIS is a hardware/software system for the storage, management, and (with hardcopy or screen graphic) selective retrieval capabilities of georeferenced data. Definitions like this one are often used by vendors and users of vector-only GIS, whose objective is sophisticated management and output of cartographic data. (A parallel definition): A GIS is a hardware/software system for managing and displaying spatial data. It is similar to a traditional Data Base Management System, where we now think in spatial rather than in tabular terms, and where the "report writer" now allows output of maps as well as of tables and numbers. Thus we can consider a GIS a "spatial DBMS" as opposed to traditional "tabular DBMSs." Few people use this definition, but it might help to explain GIS to a DBMS user. (A more aggressive definition): A GIS is a system of hardware, software, and data that facilitates the development, enhancement, modeling, and display of multivariate (e.g. multilayered) spatially referenced data. It performs some analytical functions itself, and by its analysis, selective retrieval and display capabilities, helps the user to further analyze and interpret the data. Properly configured, the GIS can model (e.g. synthetically recreate) a feature or phenomenon as a function of other features or phenomena which may be related - where all features or phenomena are represented (characterized) by spatial and related tabular data. The analytical objectives described here are sometimes controversial - and often given lip service by cartographic GIS specialists who have not yet seen what can be accomplished scientifically by a select few GISs that go beyond cartographic approaches. Another definition can be found at the University of Edinburgh. From GRASS mini-HOWTO

>&#13;Programmer's editor with multiple windows and syntax highlighting Glimmer is a simple code editor for use with just about any programming language, which makes use of of the Gtk+ widget set and the GNOME libraries, which includes drag and drop support. It includes syntax and bracket highlighting, the ability to build from within the editor, and support for saving sessions of many different code files open at once. Most settings can be customised from within the editor. Glimmer includes support for the following languages: Ada, bash/sh, C, C++, FORTRAN, HTML, Java, Javascript, Latex, GNU Make, Perl, PHP, Python, Lisp (guile, scheme, etc), SGML, SQL, Tcl/Tk, XML, XHTML, and Z80 Assembly, to name a few. Glimmer is also very extensible in the languages it supports for its syntax highlighting. If support for your language of choice is not included, you can write it very easily. In addition to this, Glimmer is completely scriptable with python. See http://glimmer.sourceforge.net for more information. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;/glob/, not /glohb/ v.,n. [Unix; common] To expand special characters in a wildcarded name, or the act of so doing (the action is also called `globbing'). The Unix conventions for filename wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many hackers use some of them in written English, especially in email or news on technical topics. Those commonly encountered include the following: * wildcard for any string (see also UN*X) ? wildcard for any single character (generally read this way only at the beginning or in the middle of a word) [] delimits a wildcard matching any of the enclosed characters {} alternation of comma-separated alternatives; thus, `foo{baz,qux}' would be read as `foobaz' or `fooqux' Some examples: "He said his name was [KC]arl" (expresses ambiguity). "I don't read talk.politics.*" (any of the talk.politics subgroups on Usenet). Other examples are given under the entry for X. Note that glob patterns are similar, but not identical, to those used in regexps. Historical note: The jargon usage derives from glob, the name of a subprogram that expanded wildcards in archaic pre-Bourne versions of the Unix shell.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;The OpenGL Utility Toolkit. GLUT (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs.  It implements a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for OpenGL. GLUT makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL programming. GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system toolkits like Motif. GLUT is simple, easy, and small. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

When user decides to read a man page, gman will launch a terminal window and call the original man system to display the man page in the window. Gman can launch more than one terminal window at same time. And user can use the index search function to look for the man pages that he needs. It's simple, but it's useful. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Fight the infection. Gnome is the "GNU Network Object Model Environment" It is a project to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based entirely on free software. As the README puts it: Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system. Your objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with your vital software.  The game ends when only 0 or 1 of your computers is being productive.  Additionally, some computers are connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on the other end when it reaches there. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;GNOME-based Notepad editor This is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple text editor for Unix based systems running X11 and using GNOME (the GNU Network Object Model Environment).  Gnotepad+ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while still providing many of the common features found in a modern GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way. The "+" in gnotepad+ is there to differentiate it from other GNOME-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad". Additionally, gnotepad+ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you are looking for a programmer's editor, look for another text editor or help improve the GTK Text Widget. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;/gnoo/, not /noo/ 1. [acronym: `GNU's Not Unix!', see recursive acronym] A Unix-workalike development effort of the Free Software Foundation headed by Richard Stallman &#60;rms@gnu.org&#62;. GNU EMACS and the GNU C compiler, two tools designed for this project, have become very popular in hackerdom and elsewhere. The GNU project was designed partly to proselytize for RMS's position that information is community property and all software source should be shared. One of its slogans is "Help stamp out software hoarding!" Though this remains controversial (because it implicitly denies any right of designers to own, assign, and sell the results of their labors), many hackers who disagree with RMS have nevertheless cooperated to produce large amounts of high-quality software for free redistribution under the Free Software Foundation's imprimatur. The GNU project has a web page at http://www.gnu.org. See EMACS, copyleft, General Public Virus, Linux. 2.

Using the web cgi a user can set their desired homepage in their settings and then set the special URL as the default page for their browser so now every time they open their browser their hostname will be automatically be updated without having to run any other sort of client application and then they would be redirected to the URL they set in their GnuDIP settings.

>&#13;A versatile News and mailing list reader for Emacsen Gnus is a message-reading laboratory.  This is by far the most powerful and extensible news reader that I am aware of. It will let you look at just  about anything as if it were a newsgroup.  You can read mail with it,  you can browse directories with it, you can ftp with it---you can even read news with it! It handles single file groups, MH format folders, mbox files, digests, knows about POP, etc. It can split incoming mail ala procmail. This version of gnus handles MIME natively. It adds offline reading capability with gnus-agent. It is not compatible with older versions of TM (since a large number of hooks and variables have changed to allow that). NOTE: Please do not use tm-gnus with  this version. Instead of boring old KILL files, it has an adaptive multifaceted scoring mechanism -- you add or reduce the score of the article based on rules, and a component of the score comes in from your past behaviour -- for example, articles similar to ones you read and saved get higher scores. This adaptive mechanism is one of the most interesting part of Gnus. Gnus tries to empower people who read news the same way Emacs empowers people who edit text.  Gnus sets no limits to what the user should be allowed to do.  Users are encouraged to extend Gnus to make it behave like they want it to behave.  A program should not control people; people should be empowered to do what they want by using (or abusing) the program. Gnus comes by default with XEmacs, but this is a stand alone package that replaces the stock Gnusii. A note for people  using the nnimap backend: SSL support requires w3-el-e20; and even otherwise w3-el makes following hyperlinks in mail and news easier.

>&#13;OpenStep (based on NeXTStep) was a GUI specification published in 1994 by Sun Microsystems and NeXT Computers, meant for building applications. It uses the Objective-C language, which is an object-oriented extension to C, that is arguably more suited to this kind of development than is C++. OpenStep requires a PostScript display engine that is analogous to the X protocol, but it is considered superior to X because all graphics are independent of the pixel resolution of the screen. In other words, high-resolution screens would improve the picture quality without making the graphics smaller. The GNUStep project has a working PostScript display engine and is meant as a Free replacement to OpenStep. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;Gopher is an almost irrelevant protocol today, but it was very popular in the early 1990s. Gopher is simply a hierarchical menu of hyperlinks. This means that like HTTP/HTML, you can build virtual sites containing documents from other sites. However, unlike HTTP/HTML, the only structure is that of a hierarchical menu: it doesn't support hyperlinking within the documents that it points to. Key point: There are still a lot of Gopher servers out there, However, since they are no longer mainstream, they are rarely maintained by security people. Therefore, they often present a way to compromise the network. From Hacking-Lexicon

Gopher was originally developed at the University of Minessota and nameeed after the school mascot. Unlike FTP and Archie, Gopher doesn't require you to know and use details of host, directory, and file names, Instead, you browse though menus and press Enter when you find something interseting. You usually see another menu, with more options, until finally you seect an option that displays information. You can then read the infromation or save it to your disk storage area after retreiving it with anonymous FTP.

>&#13;Invented at the University of Minnesota in 1993 just before the Web, gopher was a widely successful method of making menus of material available over the Internet. Gopher was designed to be much easier to use than FTP, while still using a text-only interface. Gopher is a Client and Server style program, which requires that the user have a Gopher Client program. Although Gopher spread rapidly across the globe in only a couple of years, it has been largely supplanted by Hypertext, also known as WWW (World Wide Web). There are still thousands of Gopher Servers on the Internet and we can expect they will remain for a while. From Matisse

>&#13;n. A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and obsolesced around 1995 by the World Wide Web. Gopher presents a menuing interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents, runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the net. Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed at the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a sports team). Others claim the word derives from American slang `gofer' (from "go for", dialectal "go fer"), one whose job is to run and fetch things. Finally, observe that gophers dig long tunnels, and the idea of tunneling through the net to find information was a defining metaphor for the developers. Probably all three things were true, but with the first two coming first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously adding flavor and impetus to the project as it developed out of its concept stage.

>&#13;GNU Paint - a small, easy to use paint program for GNOME This is gpaint (GNU Paint), a small-scale painting program for GNOME, the GNU Desktop Environment. gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP, it is just a simple drawing package based on xpaint, along the lines of 'Paintbrush' from a popular non-free operating system. Currently gpaint has the following features:   * Drawing tools such as ovals, freehand, polygon and text, with     fill or shadow for polygons and closed freehand shapes.   * Cut and paste by selecting irregular regions or polygons.   * Preliminary print support using gnome-print.   * Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes.   * Multiple-image editing in a single instance of the program.   * All the image processing features present in xpaint.

>&#13;Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a PC-type disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is damaged, incorrect or deleted. It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and sizes of inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical. It gives you the information you need to manually re-create them (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk, etc.). The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly believe the guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk device. Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:  * BeOS filesystem type.  * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning    scheme used on Intel platforms.  * Linux second extended filesystem.  * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 "filesystems".  * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.  * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).  * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).  * The Minix operating system filesystem type.  * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.  * QNX 4.x filesystem.  * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X &#62; 11).  * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning    scheme on PC hard disks similar to the BSD disklabels.  * Silicon Graphics' journalling filesystem for Linux. Other types may be added relatively easily, as separately compiled modules. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Don't be too hard on the program, though -- although the user interface is mighty rough, gphone does actually work pretty well.  The data rate  should be low enough to work over a reasonable modem connection. The protocol is nominally RTP/RTCP, and gphone complies well enough with the standard to be able to talk to speakfreely. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

GPr interfaces with a PostScript printer's PPD file to create a user-interface of configurable options. Based upon user choice, the device-specific option code is then inserted into the PostScript job and sent to the printer. This can be used to tell the printer to duplex or staple the print job, or tell it what paper tray to draw paper from. NOTE: gpr will detect if the file to be print is postscript, and, if not, it will call a2ps to preprocess it before sending it to ppdfilt and to lpr. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Simulator for Microchip's PIC microcontrollers Gpsim is a full-featured software simulator for Microchip PIC microcontrollers. Gpsim has been designed to be as accurate as possible. Accuracy includes the entire PIC - from the core to the I/O pins and including ALL of the internal peripherals. Thus it's possible to create stimuli and tie them to the I/O pins and test the PIC the same PIC the same way you would in the real world. Gpsim has been designed to be as fast as possible. Real time simulation speeds of 20Mhz PICs are possible. Gpsim has been designed to be as useful as possible. The standard simulation paradigm including breakpoints, single stepping, disassembling, memory inspect &#38; change, have been implemented. In addition, gpsim supports many debugging features that are only available with in-circuit emulators. For example, a continuous trace buffer tracks every action of the simulator. Also, it's possible to set read and write break points on values (e.g. break if a specific value is read from or written to a register). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Grafix should be considered as a layer between an application and the X Window system built up of a bunch of basic classes as building elements. The simplest way of using it is to define instances of these classes. For more complicated programs the user has to define own derivations to the basic classes. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Transfer sound from gramophone records to CD GramoFile enables you to record audio from (for example) gramophone records, process the signal and listen to the results. Because sound files in .WAV-format are used, it is possible to exchange the files with many other programs. Cdrecord(1) can burn CD-Recordables of these, so you can make CDs with the music of your favorite records.  The user interface of GramoFile has a windows-like look-and-feel, making it fairly easy to use. One of the most important parts of GramoFile is the ability to process digital audio signals. Through the application of several filters it is possible to accomplish a significant reduction of disturbances like ticks and scratches. These filters have been programmed in such a fashion that they can be applied in any order (and multiple times) in a single run, thus avoiding the use of temporary files. It is possible to adjust the properties of each filter independently, so in every situation an optimal result can be achieved. Another interesting feature is the track splitting. Just make one .wav file of an entire side of an record and GramoFile will detect where the individual tracks are located. This happens fully automatically, without need to set any options. More experienced users may fine-tune the algorithm, or change the detected track starts and ends, but generally that will not be necessary. Track-times are saved in an editable (plaintext) .tracks file, that will be used during the signal processing to produce one processed .wav file for each individual track. To record and play .wav files, modified versions of brec(1) and bplay(1) by David Monro are included. These programs provide buffered recording and playback, so all will go well even on a highly loaded system. Both programs have been modified to support the standard GramoFile user interface.  Brec also got a `graphical' peak level meter, and bplay a running time display. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The upstream default is simply to write a *.au file to a sound device file by using cat(1). Since cat is not a good sound player, the default is changed to use sox instead.  grandfatherclock depends on sox to ensure that it can run under the default configuration.

>&#13;is a public domain raster based GIS, vector GIS, image processing system, and graphics production system. Created by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Constriction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) and enhanced by many others, it is used extensively at government offices, universities and commercial organizations throughout the world. It is written mostly in C for various UNIX based machines. Linux is one of its more robust implementations. GRASS contains over 40 programs to render images on monitor and paper; over 60 raster manipulation programs; over 30 vector manipulation programs; nearly 30 multi-spectral image processing manipulation programs; 16 data management programs; and 6 point file management programs. GRASS' strengths lie in several fields. The simple user interface makes it an ideal platform for those learning about GIS for the first time. Users wishing to write their own code can do so by examining existing source code, interfacing with the documented GIS libraries, and by using the GRASS Programmers' Manual. This allows more sophisticated functionality to be fully integrated within GRASS. Other strengths include GRASS' pioneering of mixed resolutions in a data base, mixed geographic coverage areas in a data base, raster image compression techniques via run-length encoding and reclassification lookup tables, GRASS' rescaling of display images on the fly to fill the display screen, plus its fundamental design criterion of powerful computer-assisted scientific analysis of environmental issues (as opposed to merely going for intricate cartographic output of relatively simple processes). GRASS is usually supplied as free, non-copyright source code to be compiled on host machines. Some compiled binaries are also easily obtainable at no cost via the Internet. It runs on a variety of UNIX platforms. Copied from Project Assist Intro to GRASS. From GRASS HOWTO

[from the qed/ed editor idiom g/re/p, where re stands for a regular expression, to Globally search for the Regular Expression and Print the lines containing matches to it, via Unix grep(1)] To rapidly scan a file or set of files looking for a particular string or pattern (when browsing through a large set of files, one may speak of `grepping around'). By extension, to look for something by pattern. "Grep the bulletin board for the system backup schedule, would you?" See also vgrep.

>&#13;GNU grep, egrep and fgrep. The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west". GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing will run more slowly, however.) From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;a language for scientific illustration. Gri is an open-source language for scientific graphics programming. It is command-driven, as opposed to point/click. Some users consider Gri similar to LaTeX, since both provide extensive power as a reward for tolerating a learning curve. The output is industry-standard PostScript as output, suitable for inclusion in other documents. Gri can make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image graphs. Fine control is provided over all aspects of drawing, e.g. line widths, colors, fonts, etc. Greek letters and mathematical symbols are available in a TeX-like syntax. Folks who write 1000-line Gri scripts usually start with something as simple as the following:   open file.dat        # open a file   read columns x * y   # read the 1st column as x and the 3rd as y   draw curve           # draw the data and autoscale the axes A full manual is also available in HTML (gri-html-doc package), in PostScript suitable for printing (gri-ps-doc package) and on-line by following links from the gri home page:   http://gri.sourceforge.net/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;To continually guess passwords to find the correct one. Analogy: If someone steals your bank card, they cannot sit in front of the cash machine and guess all possible PIN numbers. After a certain number of unsuccessful tries, the bank machine will "eat" the card. Key point: Secure systems (UNIX, Windows NT) lock out accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful tries. These lock-outs can either be temporary (and restore themselves automatically), or permanent until an administrator intervene and unlocks the account. Key point: Non-secure systems (Win9x and many software applications) do not lock out accounts. For example, if you have Win9x "File and Print Sharing" turned on and protected with a password, a hacker can try continuously and invisibly to gain access to your machine. Nothing is logged, nothing is locked out. Contrast: When brute-force cracking, the hacker does all the calculations himself (comparing them against the stolen encrypted password file). When doing a grind, the hacker must enter the passwords one by one, and the target system does the calculations to see if they are valid. An intrusion detection system can detect grinds, but not cracks. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;An Open Source, distributed effort, data submission client This is the Grub crawler client, used to provide real time notification updates of webpage content to the distributed, Open Source project run and maintained at &#60;http://grub.org/&#62;. You will have to request a client-id at the homepage to let you join the force. This is needed for authenticated submissions to the database. Also, currently you can only join if you have a static IP address. Grub, in turn, provides the returned updates to any indexing or search project that needs crawled content themselves. Notifications are FREE for public consumption, but there will be some type of charge for larger queries to their database, such as those needed by the larger engines. By centralizing and organizing the crawling process, Grub hopes to increase the rate at which the Internet can be crawled and simultaneously decrease the amount of crawler traffic required for sites wanting their content indexed on a regular basis. Please don't confuse this package with the bootloader with the same name. It has nothing to do with it besides the name. The project is currently searching for a better name. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;GTK based Run dialog gRun is a GTK based Run dialog that closely resembles the Windows Run dialog, just like xexec. It has a intelligent history mechanism and a dual level fork() mechanism for launching the application in its own process. gRun also has support for launching console mode application in an XTerm as well as associations for file types. gRun is much more powerful than xexec, looks a lot better, and has the big advantage that you can start typing a command without having to mouse-click into the text field. gRun is especially useful if you do not use the GNOME desktop which has a built-in run command, and if you use a window-manager (e.g. IceWM) where you can define a  keyboard shortcut (e.g. Alt-F2) for staring gRun.

Unfortunately, because of stupid US regulations about exporting cryptographic software, the encryption cannot be added into programs like GhostScript which are distributed with source code from the US.

The Gtk widget library was written especially for gimp (GNU Image Manipulation Program), is GPL'd and written entirely in C in low-level X calls (i.e., without the X Toolkit), object oriented, fast, clean, extensible and having a staggering array of features. It comprises Glib, a library meant to extend standard C, providing higher-level functions usually akin only to scripting languages, like hash tables and lists; Gdk, a wrapper around raw X Library to give GNU naming conventions to X, and to give a slightly higher level interface to X; and the Gtk library itself. Using Gtk, the Gnome project began, analogous to KDE, but written entirely in C. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;GUID (Globally-unique Identifier)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A Microsoft Windows concept, a GUID is a large, unique number. Each Windows computer has its own GUID to identify it unique. Likewise, every time a user account is created, a GUID is assigned to the user. Key point: Microsoft got in trouble in 1999 for automatically shipping up the GUIDs as part of its registration process. Key point: GUIDs are sometimes placed within hidden fields within Microsoft documents (Word, Excel), allowing the original author to be identified. This was used in order to help track down the author of the "Melissa" worm. Key point: The GUID is generated from other "unique" information on a machine, such as the MAC address of the Ethernet adapter. It isn't guaranteed to be absolutely unique, but chances of any two GUIDs in the world being identical are remote. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;The original file compression program for UNIX/Linux. Recent versions produce files with a .gz extension. (A .z or .Z extension indicates an older version of Gzip.) Compression is used to compact files to save storage space and reduce transfer time. (When combined with Tar, the resulting file extensions may be .tgz, .tar.gz or .tar.Z.) From I-gloss
