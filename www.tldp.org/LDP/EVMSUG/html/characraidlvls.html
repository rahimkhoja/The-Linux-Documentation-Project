>B.1. Characteristics of Linux RAID levels</H1
><P
>&#13;All RAID levels are used to combine multiple devices into a single MD
array.
The MD plug-in is a region-manager, so EVMS refers to MD arrays as "regions."
MD can create these regions using disks, segments or other regions.
This means that it's possible to create RAID regions using other RAID
regions, and thus combine multiple RAID levels within a single volume stack.
</P
><P
>&#13;The following subsections describe the characteristics of each Linux RAID
level.
Within EVMS, these levels can be thought of as sub-modules of the MD plug-in.

NAME="linearmode"

>B.1.1. Linear mode</H2
><P
>&#13;Linear-RAID regions combine objects by appending them to each other.
Writing (or reading) linearly to the MD region starts by writing to the
first child object.
When that object is full, writes continue on the second child object, and so
on until the final child object is full.
Child objects of a Linear-RAID region do not have to be the same size.

</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Linear-RAID provides little or no performance benefit.
The objects are combined in a simple, linear fashion that doesn't allow
for much (if any) I/O in parallel to multiple child objects.
The performance of a Linear-RAID will generally be equivalent to
the performance of a single disk.

>B.1.2. RAID-0</H2
><P
>&#13;RAID-0 is usually referred to as "striping."
This means that data in a RAID-0 region is evenly distributed and
interleaved on all the child objects.
For example, when writing 16 KB of data to a RAID-0 region with
three child objects and a chunk-size of 4 KB, the data would be written
as follows:
</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI

break large I/O requests up and submit them in parallel across
several disks.

>&#13;Also like Linear-RAID, RAID-0 is not "true" RAID, in the sense that there
is no data redundancy (hence the name RAID "zero").  If one disk crashes,
the RAID region will be unavailable, and will likely result in a loss of all
data on that region.

>B.1.3. RAID-1</H2
><P
>&#13;RAID-1 is usually referred to as "mirroring."  Each child object in a
RAID-1 region contains an identical copy of the data in the region.
A write to a RAID-1 region results in that data being written
simultaneously to all child objects.
A read from a RAID-1 region can result in reading the data from any
one of the child objects.
Child objects of a RAID-1 region do not have to be the same size, but the
size of the region will be equal to the size of the smallest child object.
</P
><P
>&#13;Advantages:
</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;RAID-1 provides complete data redundancy. In a RAID-1 region made from
N child objects, up to N-1 of those objects can crash and the region will
still be operational, and can retrieve data from the remaining objects.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;RAID-1 can provide improved performance on I/O-reads.  Because all child
objects contain a full copy of the data, multiple read requests can be
load-balanced among all the objects.
</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Disadvantages:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;RAID-1 can cause a decrease in performance on I/O-writes.
Because each child object must have a full copy of the data, each
write to the region must be duplicated and sent to each object.
A write request cannot be completed until all duplicated writes to
the child objects are complete.

only provides the storage space of a single disk.

>B.1.4. RAID-4/5</H2
><P
>&#13;RAID-4/5 is often referred to as "striping with parity."  Like RAID-0,
the data in a RAID-4/5 region is striped, or interleaved, across all the
child objects.
However, in RAID-4/5, parity information is also calculated and recorded
for each stripe of data in order to provide redundancy in case one of
the objects is lost.
In the event of a disk crash, the data from that disk can be recovered
based on the data on the remaining disks and the parity information.
</P
><P
>&#13;In RAID-4 regions, a single child object is used to store the parity
information for each data stripe.  However, this can cause an I/O
bottleneck on this one object, because the parity information must be
updated for each I/O-write to the region.
</P
><P
>&#13;In RAID-5 regions, the parity is spread evenly across all the child
objects in the region, thus eliminating the parity bottleneck in RAID-4.
RAID-5 provides four different algorithms for how the parity is
distributed.  In fact, RAID-4 is often thought of as a special case of
RAID-5 with a parity algorithm that simply uses one object instead of
all objects.  This is the viewpoint that Linux and EVMS use.
Therefore, the RAID-4/5 level is often just referred to as RAID-5, with
RAID-4 simply being one of the five available parity algorithms.

><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;Like RAID-1, RAID-4/5 provides redundancy in the event of a hardware
failure.
However, unlike RAID-1, RAID-4/5 can only survive the loss of a
single object.
This is because only one object's worth of parity is recorded.
If more than one object is lost, there isn't enough parity information
to recover the lost data.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;RAID-4/5 provides redundancy more cost effectively than RAID-1.
A RAID-4/5 region with N disks provides N-1 times the storage space of a
single disk.
The redundancy comes at the cost of only a single disk in the region.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Like RAID-0, RAID-4/5 can generally provide an I/O performance
improvement, because large I/O requests can be broken up and submitted
in parallel to the multiple child objects.  However, on I/O-writes the
performance improvement will be less than that of RAID-0, because the
parity information must be calculated and rewritten each time a write
request is serviced.
In addition, in order to provide any performance improvement on 
I/O-writes, an in-memory cache must be maintained for recently accessed
stripes so the parity information can be quickly recalculated.
If a write request is received for a stripe of data that isn't in the
cache, the data chunks for the stripe must first be read from disk in
order to calculate the parity.  If such cache-misses occur too often,
the I/O-write performance could potentially be worse than even a
Linear-RAID region.

NAME="multipath"

>B.1.5. Multipath</H2
><P
>&#13;A multipath region consists of one or more objects, just like the other
RAID levels.  However, in multipath, the child objects actually
represent multiple physical paths to the same physical disk.  Such setups
are often found on systems with fiber-attached storage devices or SANs.
</P
><P
>&#13;Multipath is not actually part of the RAID standard, but was added
to the Linux MD driver because it provides a convenient place to create
"virtual" devices that consist of multiple underlying devices.
</P
><P
>&#13;The previous RAID levels can all be created using a wide variety of
storage devices, including generic, locally attached disks (for example, 
IDE and SCSI).  However, Multipath can only be used if the hardware
actually contains multiple physical paths to the storage device, and
such hardware is usually available on high-end systems with fiber-or 
network-attached storage.  Therefore, if you don't know whether you
should be using the Multipath module, chances are you don't need to use it.
</P
><P
>&#13;Like RAID-1 and RAID-4/5, Multipath provides redundancy against
hardware failures.
However, unlike these other RAID levels, Multipath protects against
failures in the paths to the device, and not failures in the device
itself.  If one of the paths is lost (for example, a network adapter
breaks or a fiber-optic cable is removed), I/O will be redirected to the
remaining paths.
</P
><P
>&#13;Like RAID-0 and RAID-4/5, Multipath can provide I/O performance
improvements by load balancing I/O requests across the various paths.
