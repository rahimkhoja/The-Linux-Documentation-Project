></LI

CLASS="FILENAME"
>softdog.o</TT
>.</P
><P
>Next, modprobe looks through the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/version/modules.dep</TT
>, to see if other modules
	must be loaded before the requested module may be loaded.  This file is  created by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>depmod -a</B
> and contains
	module dependencies.  For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>msdos.o</TT
> requires the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fat.o</TT
> module to be already
	loaded into the kernel.  The requested module has a dependancy on another module if the other module defines symbols
	(variables or functions) that the requested module uses.</P
><P
>Lastly, modprobe uses insmod to first load any prerequisite modules into the kernel, and then the requested module.
	modprobe directs insmod to <TT

>, the standard directory for modules.  insmod is intended to
	be fairly dumb about the location of modules, whereas modprobe is aware of the default location of modules.  So for example,
	if you wanted to load the msdos module, you'd have to either run:</P

>Lines beginning with a '#' are comments.  Blank lines are ignored.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules/2.4.?/local</TT
>.  As you can see, shell meta characters are honored.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>path[net]</TT
> line tells modprobe to look for net modules in the directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~p/mymodules</TT
>, however, the "keep" directive preceding the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>path[net]</TT
> directive
	tells modprobe to add this directory to the standard search path of net modules as opposed to replacing the standard search
	path, as we did for the misc modules.</P
><P
>The alias line says to load in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eepro.o</TT
> whenever kmod requests that the generic identifier `eth0' be
	loaded.</P
><P
>You won't see lines like "alias block-major-2 floppy" in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modules.conf</TT

	knows about the standard drivers which will be used on most systems.</P
><P
>Now you know how modules get into the kernel.  There's a bit more to the story if you want to write your own modules
	which depend on other modules (we calling this `stacking modules').  But this will have to wait for a future chapter.  We have
	a lot to cover before addressing this relatively high-level issue.</P

			their own groove.  Getting your first "hello world" program to compile and load correctly can sometimes be a trick.  Rest

> in the kernel.  We won't go into module versioning until later in this guide.
					Until we cover modversions, the examples in the guide may not work if you're running a kernel with modversioning
					turned on.  However, most stock Linux distro kernels come with it turned on.  If you're having trouble loading the
					modules because of versioning errors, compile a kernel with modversioning turned off.</P

><P
>Modules can't print to the screen like <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

> can, but they can log information and
					warnings, which ends up being printed on your screen, but only on a console.  If you insmod a module from an xterm,
					the information and warnings will be logged, but only to your log files.  You won't see it unless you look through
					your log files.  To have immediate access to this information, do all your work from console.</P

>1.2.1.3. Compiling Issues and Kernel Version</H3
><P
>Very often, Linux distros will distribute kernel source that has been patched in various non-standard ways,
					which may cause trouble.</P
><P
>A more common problem is that some Linux distros distribute incomplete kernel headers.  You'll need to compile
					your code using various header files from the Linux kernel.  Murphy's Law states that the headers that are missing are
					exactly the ones that you'll need for your module work.</P
><P
>To avoid these two problems, I highly recommend that you download, compile and boot into a fresh, stock Linux
					kernel which can be downloaded from any of the Linux kernel mirror sites.  See the Linux Kernel HOWTO for more
					details.</P
><P
>Ironically, this can also cause a problem.  By default, gcc on your system may look for the kernel headers in
					their default location rather than where you installed the new copy of the kernel (usually in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/</TT
>.  This can be fixed by using gcc's <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-I</TT
> switch.</P
