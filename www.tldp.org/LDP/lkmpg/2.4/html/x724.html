>5.1. The /proc File System</H1
><P
>In Linux there is an additional mechanism for the kernel and kernel modules to send information to processes --- the
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> file system.  Originally designed to allow easy access to information about
	processes (hence the name), it is now used by every bit of the kernel which has something interesting to report, such as
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/modules</TT
> which has the list of modules and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/meminfo</TT
> which has memory usage
	statistics.</P
><P
>The method to use the proc file system is very similar to the one used with device drivers --- you create a structure
	with all the information needed for the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> file, including pointers to any handler
	functions (in our case there is only one, the one called when somebody attempts to read from the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> file). Then, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>init_module</TT
> registers the structure with the kernel and
	<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cleanup_module</TT
> unregisters it.</P
><P
>The reason we use <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>proc_register_dynamic</TT

> is because we don't want to determine the inode number
	used for our file in advance, but to allow the kernel to determine it to prevent clashes. Normal file systems are located on a
	disk, rather than just in memory (which is where <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> is), and in that case the inode
	number is a pointer to a disk location where the file's index-node (inode for short) is located. The inode contains
	information about the file, for example the file's permissions, together with a pointer to the disk location or locations
	where the file's data can be found.</P
><P
>Because we don't get called when the file is opened or closed, there's no where for us to put
	<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>MOD_INC_USE_COUNT</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT</TT
> in this module, and if the file is opened and
	then the module is removed, there's no way to avoid the consequences. In the next chapter we'll see a harder to implement, but
	more flexible, way of dealing with <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
> files which will allow us to protect against
	this problem as well.</P

/* Put data into the proc fs file.

   Arguments
   =========
   1. The buffer where the data is to be inserted, if 
      you decide to use it.
   2. A pointer to a pointer to characters. This is 
      useful if you don't want to use the buffer 
      allocated by the kernel.
   3. The current position in the file. 
   4. The size of the buffer in the first argument.  
   5. Zero (for future use?).


   Usage and Return Value
   ======================
   If you use your own buffer, like I do, put its 
   location in the second argument and return the 
   number of bytes used in the buffer.

   A return value of zero means you have no further 
   information at this time (end of file). A negative 
   return value is an error condition.
   

   For More Information
   ==================== 
   The way I discovered what to do with this function 
   wasn't by reading documentation, but by reading the 
   code which used it. I just looked to see what uses 
   the get_info field of proc_dir_entry struct (I used a 
   combination of find and grep, if you're interested), 
   and I saw that  it is used in &#60;kernel source 
   directory&#62;/fs/proc/array.c.

   If something is unknown about the kernel, this is 
   usually the way to go. In Linux we have the great 
   advantage of having the kernel source code for 
   free - use it.
