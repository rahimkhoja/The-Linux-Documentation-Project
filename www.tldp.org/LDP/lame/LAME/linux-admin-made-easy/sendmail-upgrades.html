>10.10. Configuring the Sendmail E-mail Daemon</A
></H1
><P
>I use the Sendmail package to provide e-mail services.  Sendmail is
<EM
>the</EM
> definitive mail handler; in fact it is so popular
that it is estimated that over 80% of e-mail passing over the Internet
will be handled at one or both ends by it.  It does just about anything
and I couldn't imagine running an Internet server without it (another
e-mail server package called Qmail seems to be quite popular as well --
but I haven't had a reason yet to give it a try).</P
><P
>To keep up with new features and bug-fixes, and most importantly,
for reasons of security, it is a probably a good idea to upgrade Sendmail
from time to time.  In addition, the very latest versions of Sendmail
include powerful anti-spam features which can help prevent your mail
server being abused by unauthorized users.</P
><P
>This section will discuss some of the things you should do if you
wish to use Sendmail as an incoming e-mail server.  This would be the
likely scenario for server systems.  If, instead, you have no need to use
it for incoming mail and wish to only use it as an outgoing mail queue,
you should ((need some info here)).</P
><P
>For this section, it is assumed that you are using the very latest
version of Sendmail (8.9.3 at the time of this writing), have it installed
and running.</P
><P
>As packaged with the Red Hat distribution, Sendmail usually
contains appropriate configuration information to operate correctly in
the majority of server setups.  Nonetheless, you may find it necessary to
edit the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/sendmail.cf</TT
></TT
>''
file and customize some settings as required.  This, however, is beyond
the scope of this document.</P
><P
>One thing I find helpful, however, is to make a couple of changes to
the configuration file to thwart off spammers.  These include:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
><FONT
COLOR="RED"
>O PrivacyOptions=authwarnings</FONT

<EM

O PrivacyOptions=authwarnings,noexpn,novrfy

<FONT

>O SmtpGreetingMessage=$j Sendmail $v/$Z; $b</FONT
>
<EM
>change to:</EM
>
O SmtpGreetingMessage=$j Sendmail $v/$Z; $b  NO UCE  C=xx L=xx</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>(The first change prevents spammers from using the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXPN</TT
>'' and ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VRFY</TT
>'' commands in
sendmail.  I find that these commands are too often abused by unethical
individuals.  The second change modifies the banner which Sendmail
displays upon receiving a connection.  You should replace the
``<EM
>xx</EM
>'' in the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C=xx L=xx</TT
>''
entries with your country and location codes.  For example, in my case, I
would use ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C=CA L=ON</TT
>'' for Ontario, Canada.  (The
latter change doesn't actually affect anything, but was recommended by
folks in the <A
HREF="news:news.admin.net-abuse.email"
TARGET="_top"
>news.admin.net-abuse.email</A
> newsgroup as a legal
precaution.</P
><P
>Next, if your mail server will have a different host name than the
actual machine it is running on, you can add one or more aliases in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/sendmail.cw</TT
></TT
>'' file.  For
example, if you have a system called
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<EM
>kirk.mydomain.name</EM
>"</SPAN
> which is set up as
the mail exchanger for mydomain.name, but want incoming mail addressed in
the format ``<EM
>user@mydomain.name</EM
>'' to be delivered to
your users on <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<EM
>kirk</EM
>"</SPAN
>, simply add this
alias as follows:</P
><TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>mydomain.name</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Finally, If you need to restrict a domain (or subdomain) from
connecting to your sendmail service, you can edit the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/mail/access</TT
></TT
>'' and add the
domain information as well as type of restriction.  For example:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>some.domain             REJECT
hax0r.another.domain    550 Contact site administrator at (555) 555-1234.</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>The above examples would reject all e-mail connections from the
``<EM
>some.domain</EM
>'' site, as well as reject the specific
machine name ``<EM
>hax0r.another.domain</EM
>'' with a
descriptive message.</P
><P
>After making changes to this file, you will need to update the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>access.db</TT
></TT
>'' file, and then
restart sendmail as follows:</P

>If you're using Sendmail version 8.9 or above, RBL support is
already built in, but not enabled by default.  To enable this support, add
the following to your sendmail.mc file:</P
><TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>        FEATURE(rbl)</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Then, reconfigure and restart the Sendmail daemon.</P
><P
>For more detailed information, including configuration instructions
for other mail transport agents, see <A
HREF="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rbl/usage.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.mail-abuse.org/rbl/usage.html</A
>.</P
><P
>Sometimes, a domain may end up in the RBL list with which you wish
to continue communications with.  Perhaps it is vital for you to
communicate with certain users at the black-listed domain.  In this case,
Sendmail allows you to override these domains to allow their e-mail to be
received.  Simply edit the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/mail/access</TT
></TT
>'' file in the
manner described above with the appropriate domain information.  For
example:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>blacklisted.domain      OK</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Don't forget to rebuild your access.db file (described above)!</P
><P
>If you do decide to subscribe to the RBL, it is probably a wise idea
to inform your mail users, if applicable, so they can make other service
arrangements if they disagree with your decision.</P
