>As storage needs increase, it sometimes becomes necessary to put
additional drives with larger capacities online.  Yet ironically, the law
of probability dictates that as the number of storage devices increases,
so too does the likelihood of a device failure.  Therefore, a system with
a single hard drive is only 25% as likely to suffer a hardware failure as
a system with four drives.  [ Well, theoretically speaking, anyway :-) ]</P
><P
>Fortunately, such failures can be handled gracefully, and more
importantly without downtime, using a technique called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Redundant
Array of Inexpensive Disks"</SPAN
> (<EM
>RAID</EM
>) which uses
one of several methods of distributing data over multiple disks.  This
redundancy allows for automatic recovery of data should a device
fail.</P

>This section will describe the installation, configuration, and
setup of a RAID disk array using the Mylex AcceleRAID DAC960 controller.  
I have been very impressed with not only the performance and reliability
of the controller itself, but also with the technical support I've gotten
from Mylex -- they are very Linux-friendly!  (However, there are a wide
variety of hardware RAID solutions for Linux, and RAID can be implemented
in software by the Linux kernel itself.)  The type of RAID implementation
that is most useful is probably RAID level 5.</P
><P
>The first step in getting the RAID controller usable under Linux is to
build a custom kernel with driver support for the hardware.  The driver
for the Mylex DAC960 can be downloaded from the Dandelion Digital Linux
page at <A
HREF="http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/DAC960-2.0.tar.gz"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/DAC960-2.0.tar.gz</A
>.</P
><P
>The final step in getting your RAID array usable under Linux is to
use the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fdisk</TT
>'' utility to create valid partitions.  
This is done in exactly the same manner as you would use on an IDE or
regular SCSI drive.  See <A
HREF="install-partitioning.html"
>Section 4.3</A
> for
details on how to set up partition information.</P

>Note: </B
>Note: The DAC960 driver supports a maximum of 7 partitions per
logical drive.  If you need to define more, you will need to define
multiple logical drives in the RAID configuration utility (press

at system boot time to enter the setup utility).</P

>Once you are able to see your RAID array, you should initialize any
swap areas and file systems you wish to define.  The following is an
example of initializing a swap area on the third partition of the second
drive, as well as an ext2-formatted file system on the first partition of
the first drive:</P

``<TT

commands enable bad-block checking as the appropriate swap/file systems
are created.  This adds <EM
>substantially</EM
> to the time it
takes to complete the process, but it is probably a very good idea to
perform such checks.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE

><P
>For any new swap areas you have defined, you should make an entry
in the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/etc/fstab</TT
>'' file to ensure the swap area is
actually used from subsequent bootups.  As per the above example, the
following line should be added:</P

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>/dev/rd/c0d1p3  swap       swap  defaults   0 0</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Finally, once your file systems have been initialized, you can
create mount points there and move your large file systems onto the array
as you desire.  It is probably a good idea to test the array for a few
days before using it in a production environment.</P
