>Linux can also provide Appleshare services (eg. Macintosh-style network
file &#38; printer sharing), using the Netatalk package.  This section will
describe how to configure shares, and how to access them from client
machines.</P
><P
>In order to use Netatalk, you will need to have Appletalk networking
support in your Linux kernel.  Stock kernels from Red Hat usually already
include this support as a module, or you can compile your own custom
kernel with such support.</P

CLASS="NOTE"

>Note: </B
>Note: Make sure Appletalk support is compiled in as a
<EM

> and not included as part of the kernel (see
<A
HREF="linux-kernel-upgrades.html"
>Section 10.4</A
> for details on how to upgrade or
customize the Linux kernel).  Otherwise you will have difficulties when
stopping and then restarting the Netatalk daemon.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV
><P
>Once you have ensured your kernel is capable of supporting Appletalk, you
will need to install the Netatalk package.  Because Netatalk is not
included with the Red Hat distribution, you will have to download and
install a copy.  The Netatalk package can be found on Red Hat's

>After Netatalk has been installed, you may need to modify one or
more configuration files in
``<TT

files contain sample configuration examples, and therefore are at least
somewhat self-documenting.  The files are:</P

your Netatalk daemon. This information is specified in environment

> (ie. read) by the
Netatalk start up script before the service is started.  You can specify
the number of simultaneous connections, whether or not guest logins are
allowed, etc.  You will almost certainly want to modify this file
according to your needs.</P

>atalk.conf</DT

><P
>This file contains information on which network interface
to use, as well as your Appletalk routing, name registration, and other
related information. You will likely not need to modify this file; the
required network information is detected and added to this file the first

server name.</P

>Tip: A neat trick here is to set up shares with the same
file paths under Samba, which would provide your users with platform-
independent file shares for both your Mac as well as your Windows users.
See <A

Samba.</P

difference being that these shares will be made available to
<EM

This file also contains file-type mappings. You will likely not need to
modify this file unless you want to add general shares available to
anyone; this is probably a bad idea for most people.</P
