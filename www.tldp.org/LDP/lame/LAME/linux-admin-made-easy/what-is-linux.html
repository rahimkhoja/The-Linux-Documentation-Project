>3.1. What is Linux?</A
></H1
><P
>Linux is a true 32-bit operating system that runs on a variety of
different platforms, including Intel, Sparc, Alpha, and Power-PC (on some
of these platforms, such as Alpha, Linux is actually 64-bit).  There are
other ports available as well, but I do not have any experience with
them.</P
><P
>Linux was first developed back in the early 1990s, by a young
Finnish then-university student named Linus Torvalds.  Linus had a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"state-of-the-art"</SPAN
> 386 box at home and decided to write an
alternative to the 286-based Minix system (a small unix-like
implementation primarily used in operating systems classes), to take
advantage of the extra instruction set available on the then-new chip, and
began to write a small bare-bones kernel.</P
><P
>Eventually he announced his little project in the USENET group
<A
HREF="news:comp.os.minix"
TARGET="_top"
>comp.os.minix</A
>, asking for
interested parties to take a look and perhaps contribute to the project.  
The results have been phenomenal!</P
><P
>The interesting thing about Linux is, it is completely free!  Linus
decided to adopt the GNU Copyleft license of the Free Software
Foundation, which means that the code is protected by a copyright --
but protected in that it must always be available to others.</P
><P
>Free means <EM
>free</EM
> -- you can get it for free, use
it for free, and you are even free to sell it for a profit (this isn't as
strange as it sounds; several organizations, including Red Hat, have
packaged up the standard Linux kernel, a collection of GNU utilities, and
put their own <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"flavour"</SPAN
> of included applications, and sell
them as distributions.  Some common and popular distributions are
Slackware, Red Hat, SuSe, and Debian)!  The great thing is, you have
access to source code which means you can customize the operating systems
to your <EM
>own</EM
> needs, not those of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"target
market"</SPAN
> of most commercial vendors.</P
><P
>Linux can and should be considered a full-blown implementation of unix. 
However, it can not be called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Unix"</SPAN
>; not because of
incompatibilities or lack of functionality, but because the word
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Unix"</SPAN
> is a registered trademark owned by AT&#38;T, and the
use of the word is only allowable by license agreement.</P
><P
>Linux is every bit as supported, as reliable, and as viable as any
other operating system solution (well, in my opinion, quite a bit
more so!).  However, due to its origin, the philosophy behind it, and the
lack of a multi-million dollar marketing campaign promoting it, there are
lot of myths about it.  People have a lot to learn about this wonderful
OS!</P
