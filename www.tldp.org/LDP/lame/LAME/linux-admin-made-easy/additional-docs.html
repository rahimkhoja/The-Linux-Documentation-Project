>There is an incredible amount of documentation available for Linux
and its applications.  Most of this can be found on the web and in your
local bookstore, but you will probably find that a large quantity of
useful documentation is already available to you, having been loaded as
part of the Red Hat Linux installation procedure.</P
><P
>The man pages are a must-view when you are trying to figure out how
a command works.  For example, if you are trying to figure out how to use
the ``tar'' utility, you could type ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>man tar</TT
>'' and be
provided with a very verbose description of tar including all of its
command-line options.</P
><P
>You can find more general information in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/</TT
></TT
>'' directory.  Here
you will find subdirectories which include documentation on utilities and
commands, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) documents, as well as HOWTO
documents providing good instruction on a variety of topics, such as how
to set up networking, or install support for the Japanese
language.</P
><P
>You should also look in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/info/</TT
></TT
>'' directory which
contains tutorials on utilities, libraries, and applications such as
emacs.</P
><P
>Finally, you should visit the Red Hat User's Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ) document at <A
HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~aturner/RedHat-FAQ/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.pobox.com/~aturner/RedHat-FAQ/</A
> which contains a lot of
helpful information specific to the Red Hat distribution of Linux.</P
