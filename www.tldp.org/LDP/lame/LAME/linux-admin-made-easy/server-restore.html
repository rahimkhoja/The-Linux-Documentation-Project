>Caution: Extracting files from a tar archive can be a
dangerous thing to do, and should therefore be done with caution.  
Perhaps the files were not archived without a file path prepended (a few
misguided or uninformed developers distribute tarballs of their software
offerings like this), meaning they will all be extracted into the current
directory.  Perhaps the files were archived with leading
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/</TT
>'' slashes (by specify the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>--absolute-paths</TT
>'' option when the archive was
created), meaning the files will be restored to their absolute locations
(even if you didn't want them to be).  Or, perhaps the files were archived
<EM
>without</EM
> leading ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/</TT
>'' slashes,
meaning the files will be restored under the current directory (even if
you didn't want them to be).  This of course, depends on how the backup
was created.  For this reason, I strongly recommend testing your ``tar''
command with a ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t</TT
>'' (<EM
>type</EM
>) option
<EM
>first,</EM
> and then replace the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>t</TT
>''
with an ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>x</TT
>'' (<EM
>extract</EM
>) when you
are absolutely sure the command will do what you expect it
to.</P

archive file, tar will strip leading ``<TT

characters from file path names.  This means that restore files may not
end up in the same locations they were backed up from.  Therefore, either
change to the ``<TT

directory, or use the ``<TT

your hard drive, and is a unique file created for each backup tape
formatted by KDat, and is updated each time you perform a backup.</P
><P
>If this corresponding tape index is missing (perhaps you are
restoring from a backup set created on another machine, or the index file
was deleted or somehow corrupted on your hard drive), KDat will inform you
of this fact, and ask you if it is okay to recreate the index by reading
the tape.  Because you will need to recreate it before you will be able to
restore your desired files, it makes perfect sense to left-click

selection process).</P

<SPAN

>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Restore...</TT
>"</SPAN
> from the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"File"</SPAN
>
option on the menu bar (or left-click the tape restore icon).  KDat will
display a dialog box, allowing you to confirm which files will be
restored.  In addition, you have the option of specifying a directory
into which files will be restored.  This will allow you to restore
critical system files into your home directory, and then compare, move,
or update those files to their intended location later on.  This is
actually the safest way of restoring files.</P
><P
>To begin the recovery process, click the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

tape and restore the selected files.</P
><P
>On occasion, you may find it necessary or useful to restore one or
more files from a backup set created with KDat
<EM
>without</EM
> using KDat to do so.  Perhaps you would like
to restore such files on a system that does not offer a GUI-based
environment, or would like to do so over a slow network connection through
which remote execution of KDat would be impractical.  Fortunately, KDat
writes its backup data sets using the ``tar'' tool, a command-line based
tool that is available on any *nix system.</P
><P
>Should you wish to restore your KDat-created backup set using tar, simply
do so using whatever options you would with any normal backup set created
with tar itself.  Bear in mind, however, that data sets are not stored
in compressed format.</P
><DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
><B
>Note: </B
>Note: You will almost certainly get an error message when trying to
access the KDat backup set with tar.  This is because of the header and
other information that KDat added to the tape when it was first formatted.  
Simply repeat the tar command two or three times to skip to the beginning
of the actual tar archive file.</P
