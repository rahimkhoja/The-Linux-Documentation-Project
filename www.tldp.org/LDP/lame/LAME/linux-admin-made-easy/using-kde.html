><P
>The K Desktop Package (KDE) is another popular window manager that is
somewhat more mature than GNOME is at the time of this writing.  However,
it seems to require a bit more memory resources than GNOME does, so take
into consideration the amount of RAM you have available on your system (if
you have anything less than 64 Mb of RAM and 128 Mb of swap, you might be
better off using GNOME).</P
><P
>The first step for installing KDE is to download the latest RPM
distribution of the package.  To do so, locate an FTP mirror at <A
HREF="http://www.kde.org/mirrors.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.kde.org/mirrors.html</A
>.  Try to choose a mirror that is
close to your geographic location, but make sure whichever one you choose
is updated often (which can be determined by looking at the list of
mirrors).</P
><P
>When you have found a suitable mirror, download all the RPM files
which are applicable to your version of Red Hat and your platform.  For
example, if you are using Red Hat 5.2 (or above) on an Intel platform, you
will likely want to download the package from the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/pub/mirrors/kde/stable/latest/distribution/rpm/RedHat-5.2/i386/</TT
></TT
>''
directory on the FTP mirror.</P
><P
>After you have all the necessary files, the KDE package can be
installed with the following simple commands, typed as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
>
(make sure you are in the directory where all your KDE rpm files
are):</P

><P
>The above commands will install the Qt libraries first, and then
install the KDE base package.  Once this is done, you should log off
and log back in (or if you are ``su''ed as root, just exit and ``su''
again) so that your path environment is set appropriately, then type:</P

``<TT

><TT

>'' that
should have been included with the KDE files you downloaded.</P
><P
>If all goes well, and KDE has been installed without any error
messages, you may, if you wish, configure KDE to be the default window
manager for any of your users (the one they will see immediately after
typing ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>startx</TT
