>Note: Red Hat versions 5.1 and earlier used the BIND 4.x package,
which used a slightly different format for its configuration file.  BIND
8.x offers more functionality over that offered by BIND 4.x, and as 4.x is
no longer being developed, you should probably consider upgrading your
BIND package to the latest version.  Simply install the BIND RPM package
(see <A
HREF="using-rpm.html"
>Section 10.1</A
> for details on using the RPM utility),
then convert your configuration file to the new format.</P
><P
>Fortunately, converting your existing BIND 4.x configuration file to
be compliant with BIND 8.x is easy!  In the documentation directory
provided as part of BIND (for example,
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/bind-8.1.2/</TT
></TT
>'' for BIND
version 8.1.2), there exists a file called
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>named-bootconf.pl</TT
></TT
>'', which is an
executable Perl program.  Assuming you have Perl installed on your system,
you can use this program to convert your configuration file.  To do so,
type the following commands (as root):</P

>Tip: </B
>Tip: Make note of the <TT

options above, which restricts DNS zone transfers to a given IP address.  
In our example, we are allowing the host at 123.12.41.40 (probably a slave
DNS server in our domain) to request zone transfers.  If you omit this
option, anyone on the Internet will be able to request such transfers.  
As the information provided is often used by spammers and IP spoofers, I
strongly recommend you restrict zone transfers except to your slave DNS
server(s), or use the loopback address, ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>127.0.0.1</TT
>''
instead.</P
