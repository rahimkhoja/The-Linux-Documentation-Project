></H1
><P
>There is quite a variety of Linux distributions from which to choose
from.  Each distribution offers the same base Linux kernel and system
tools, but differ on installation method and bundled applications.  Each
distribution has its own advantages as well as disadvantages, so it is
wise to spend a bit of time researching which features are available in a
given distribution before deciding on one.</P
><P
>The following is a list of a few web sites you can visit, which will
describe a given Linux distribution as well as provide information on how
you can download or purchase it:</P

>The Red Hat distribution, by commercial vendor Red Hat
Software, Inc. is one of the most popular distributions.  With a choice of
GUI- and text-based installation procedures, Red Hat 6.1 is possibly the
easiest Linux distribution to install.  It offers easy upgrade and
package management via the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RPM</TT
>'' utility, and
includes both the GNU Network Object Model Environment
(<EM
>GNOME</EM
>) and the ``K Desktop Environment''
(<EM
>KDE</EM
>), both popular GUI window managers for the X
Window System. This distribution is available for the Intel, Alpha, and
Sparc platforms.</P

community.  It also offers easy upgrade and package management via the
``<TT

the Intel, Alpha, Sparc, and Motorola (Macintosh, Amiga, Atari)
platforms.</P

is another popular distribution, and is the leading distribution in
Europe.  It includes the ``K Desktop Environment''
(<EM

management via the ``<TT

>The OpenLinux distribution, by commercial vendor Caldera,
is aimed towards corporate users.  With the new OpenLinux 2.2 release,
Caldera has raised the bar with what appears to be the easiest to install
distribution of Linux available today.  In addition, it comes standard
with the ``K Desktop Environment'' (<EM
>KDE</EM

distribution is available for the Intel platform only.</P

>The Slackware distribution, by Patrick Volkerding of
Walnut Creek Software, is the grandfather of modern distributions of
Linux.  Offers a fairly simple installation procedure, but poor upgrade
and package management.  Still based on the libc libraries but the next
version will probably migrate to the newer glibc.  Recommended for users
who are more technical and familiar with Linux.  This distribution is
available for the Intel platform only.</P

>Tip: If you decide to buy your distribution on CD-ROM, you might be
able to find better pricing at other resellers (for example, I've been
quite satisfied on several dealings with Internet-based software vendor
<A
HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com/"

>http://www.cheapbytes.com/</A

On the other hand, you may wish to pay the higher price to the
distribution vendors to ensure that their offerings continue to
improve.</P

>My distribution of choice is Red Hat Linux (it also happens to be,
unarguably, the most popular distribution among Linux users).  For almost
three years, I was a die-hard Slackware fanatic (before that I had messed
around a bit with a small distribution from tsx-11 way back in the kernel
0.90a days), and although I've tried Red Hat in the past, I never could
bring myself to say anything good about their distributions.  Then, I
tried Red Hat 5.1, and found myself quickly converted!  In my opinion,
with 5.1, Red Hat finally <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"got it right"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Some of the reasons I have become a fan of the Red Hat distribution
include the ease of installation, multi-platform support (until recently,
Red Hat was the only distribution vendor to provide its distribution for
Intel, Alpha, and Solaris platforms), and, above all, the RPM package
manager.  In addition, they put updates to included RPM's on their FTP
site (at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/updates/"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/updates/</A
>)
as they become available, which is a good way of keeping one's system up
to date and free of any bugs or security problems that are discovered from
time to time.</P
><P
>Since first loading Red Hat 5.1 on an otherwise unused computer at work
for testing purposes, I have converted two of our main Internet/File &#38;
Print servers over from Slackware to Red Hat and haven't regretted it.  
I've also loaded it on my system and home, and installed it on three other
systems as light servers as well.  In addition, I have had the opportunity
to not only play with the Intel-based versions but with Alpha- and
Sparc-based versions as well.  Recently, I've moved all the Linux systems
I am responsible for over to Red Hat 6.1.</P
><P
>Therefore, this document has a definite Red Hat <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"feel"</SPAN
>
to it, and is most relevant for the Intel-based 6.1 version.  However,
hopefully most or at least some of the information contained in this
document will be useful to users of other distributions.</P
