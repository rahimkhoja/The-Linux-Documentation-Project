file &#38; printer sharing), using the Samba package.  This section will
describe how to configure shares, and how to access them from client
machines.</P

check if it is installed and what version you have by typing:</P

file system to accomodate the files you will store.  Personally, I usually
set up a large partition mounted on /archive/ and place my shares
here.</P

>Tip: </B
>Tip: Recent versions of Samba, from 2.0 onwards, provide a
very slick web-based configuration utility called
``<EM
>swat</EM
>'', which makes the process much more
user-friendly.  The utility listens on TCP port <EM
>901</EM
>
of your server, so to use the utility just point your favourite web
browser as follows:</P

CLASS="SCREEN"
>mydomain.name:901</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>(Of course, in order to use the SWAT utility you will need to have
a web server running, such as Apache.  See <A
HREF="web-server-administration.html"
>Section 7.1</A
> for details.)</P
><P
>The latest Samba versions also add considerable features in comparison with
versions prior to 2.0.  It is worth taking the time to upgrade this
package.</P
><P
>A client must have a TCP/IP network stack running in order to
connect to shares.  Further, for browsing to work, the TCP/IP protocol
must be bound to NETBEUI.  Under Windows 95 this can be configured from
the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Network"</SPAN
> icon from within the Control Panel.</P
><P
>Assuming the client has been configured properly, you should see the
server shares appear in their <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Network Neighborhood"</SPAN
> (or
equivalent browsing scheme if you are not using Windows 95/NT).  You can
then map network drives from the network neighborhood, or type in an
absolute path to the share (<EM
>eg.
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"\\mail\cdrom"</SPAN
></EM
>).  If the shared service requires a
password to be entered, you will be prompted for one.</P
