>Next, the installation program needs to write a boot loader to your
hard drive.  The boot loader (<EM
>LILO</EM
> on Intel systems)
is responsible for booting Linux along with any other operating systems if
you have set up your system for multi-boot (see <A
HREF="install-lilo.html#INSTALL-LILO-MULTI"
>Section 4.8.1</A
> for details on this).</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Lilo Installation</TT
>"</SPAN
> dialog box
will ask you to choose where the boot loader image should be written to.  
You'll likely want to install it on the master boot record of your first
drive (usually /dev/hda for IDE, /dev/sda for SCSI).</P
><P
>Once you have selected the location for writing the boot loader, a
second dialog box will appear, allowing you to enter extra boot-time
configuration parameters.  Usually you don't need to enter anything here,
but if you have more than 64 Mb of RAM you'll need to enter a special
parameter in order to have Linux make use of the extra RAM (otherwise, it
will only use the first 64 Mb).  For example, if your system has 128 Mb of
RAM, you should enter:</P

partition with more than 1023 cylinders, it may be necessary to enable
the option to <SPAN

>.  If it
is not, enabling this option shouldn't hurt anything, so it is probably a
good idea to do so.</P

>Finally, if you've set up your system to multi-boot Linux with other
operating system(s), you'll be presented with a third dialog box which
lists the available partitions.  Here, you can assign names to your other
operating systems (which you enter at the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"LILO"</SPAN
> prompt at
boot time to boot your desired operating system.  The installation program
does assign default names to each bootable partition, so it isn't
necessary to change them unless you don't like the defaults.</P
><P
>The default operating system that will boot upon system start up will,
of course, be Linux.  However, if you wish, you can change the default to
any of the other operating systems you have defined.</P
><P
>After installing the boot loader on your hard drive, the
installation program should hopefully present you with a
<SPAN

>"Congratulations"</SPAN

successfully installed.  Remove the installation floppy diskette (if
any), and press <TT

reboot your system...into Linux!</P

>Linux will boot, and if all goes well you should see a
<SPAN

<SPAN
