>There are a variety of methods of performing backups with Linux.  
These include command-line tools included with every Linux distribution,
such as ``dd'', ``dump'', ``cpio'', as well as ``tar''.  Also available
are text-based utilities, such as ``Amanda'' and ``Taper'', which is
designed to add a more user-friendly interface to the backup and restore
procedures.  There are GUI-based utilities as well, such as ``KDat''.  
Finally, commercial backup utilities are also available, such as ``BRU''
and ``PerfectBackup+''. Any one of these backup solutions can provide
protection for your valuable data.</P

>A brief listing of some of the tools available, including where they
can be obtained, can be found on the <SPAN

a backup solution, you will need to consider the following factors:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Portability</EM
> - Is backup portability
(ie. the ability to backup on one Linux distribution or implementation of
Unix and restore to another; for example from Solaris to Red Hat Linux)
important to you? If so, you'll probably want to choose one of the
command-line tools (eg. ``dd'', ``dump'', ``cpio'', or ``tar''), because
you can be reasonably sure that such tools will be available on any *nix
system.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Unattended or automated backups</EM
> - Is
the ability to automate backups so that they can be performed at regular
intervals without human intervention important to you?  If so, you will
need to choose both a tool and a backup medium which will support such a
backup scheme.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>User-friendliness</EM
> - Is a
user-friendly interface important to you?  If so, you will likely want to
choose a tool which provides a text- or GUI-based interface.  The
commercial utilities may provide the easiest interfaces as well as added
technical support.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Remote backups</EM
> - Is the ability to
start backups and restores from a remote machine important to you?  If so,
you'll probably want to choose one of the command-line tools or text-based
utilities instead of the GUI-based utilities (unless you have a reasonably
fast network connection and the ability to run remote X
sessions).</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Network backups</EM
> - Is performing
backups and restores to and from networked hosts important to you?  If so,
you'll probably want to use one of several of the command-line utilities
(such as ``tar'') which support network access to backup devices, or a
specialized utility such as ``Amanda'' or one of several commercial
utilities.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>Media types</EM
> - Backups can be stored
on a variety of medium, such as tape, an extra hard drive, ZIP drives, or
rewritable CDs.  Consider cost vs. reliability, storage capacitity, and
transfer speed.</P

actually a pseudo-file containing the contents of your entire memory,

I use most:  ``tar'' (whose name stands for <SPAN

which is a command-line backup tool largely portable across *nix systems;
as well as ``KDat'', a GUI-based tape backup utility which comes included
with the KDE packages (see <A

on KDE).</P
><P
>Finally, I should add that, depending on your choice of backup
solution, even if the tool doesn't have the ability built-in to schedule
automated or unattended backups, you may be able to automate such backups
by using the cron facilities.  See <A

(compress; the backup data will be compressed with ``gzip''),

protection information will be <SPAN

restored).  The ``<EM
>f</EM
>'' (file) option states that the
very next argument will be the name of the archive file (or device) being
written.  Notice how a filename which contains the current date is
derived, simply by enclosing the ``date'' command between two back-quote
characters.  A common naming convention is to add a
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar</TT
></TT
>'' suffix for non-compressed
archives, and a ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar.gz</TT

for compressed ones.</P
><P
>The ``<EM

switch to the following directory path (the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT
></TT
>'' directory in this example) prior to
starting the backup.  The ``<EM
>--exclude</EM

tar not to bother backing up the specified directories or files.  
Finally, the ``<EM

back up everything in the current directory.</P

are cAsE-sEnSiTiVe!  In addition, most of the options can be specified as
either single mneumonic characters (eg. ``f''), or by their
easier-to-memorize full option names (eg. ``file'').  The mneumonic
representations are identified by prefixing them with a ``-'' character,

However, archive files stored without compression have a very high
recoverability for non-affected files, even if portions of the tape
archive are corrupted.</P

possible to write multiple sets on one tape. (You may also refer to the
device as ``<TT

case the tape is automatically rewound after the backup set is

This is tar's default mode of operation, and it is intended to protect you
from overwriting critical files with older versions of those files, should
you mistakenly recover the wrong file(s) in a restore operation.  If you
really dislike this behavior (remember, its a
<EM

``<TT

the leading slashes.  However, I don't recommend doing so, as it is
