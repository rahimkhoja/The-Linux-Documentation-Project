>Red Hat has produced some pretty impressive versions of their
distribution so far, but seems to have a history of releasing them when
they are not quite <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ready for prime time"</SPAN
>.  Therefore in order
to take full advantage of your Linux system, it is necessary to download
and apply updated packages.  These packages, also called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"rpm
files"</SPAN
> are applied using the RPM utility (for details on this
utility, see <A
HREF="using-rpm.html"
>Section 10.1</A
>).</P
><P
>This will prove to be one of the more time-consuming parts of
getting your Linux system ready (unless you have a stellarly fast Internet
connection). However, take the time to do this!  You will likely save
yourself a <EM
>lot</EM
> of grief!</P
><P
>First, download all files from:</P

><P
>(The above assumes you are using Linux on an Intel box).</P
><P
>You should probably download everything into a single directory,
and then you can simply type:  ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -Uvh *</TT
>'' which
will upgrade all the packages. If you've downloaded any kernel rpm files,
you should probably move them to another directory for now.  Upgrading or
customizing your kernel is a bit more complicated and needs to be done
with great care (see <A
HREF="linux-kernel-upgrades.html"
>Section 10.4</A
> for details
on this).  Therefore before you apply the upgrades, you may wish to
consider moving all the kernel-*.rpm files out of your temporary upgrade
directory.</P
><P
>To apply the upgrades, you can simply run
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm</TT
>'' against all the packages at once (ie.
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -Uvh *</TT
>"</SPAN
>), or if you prefer, you can
upgrade them one at a time (ie. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rpm -Uvh
file_to_upgrade.rpm</TT
>"</SPAN
>).  The latter method is for us anal
types who wish to ensure that each update is applied correctly without
error.  :-)</P
><P
>Perhaps you are curious to see if a given package is installed
before you attempt to upgrade it.  Or perhaps you wish to find out what
version of a given package is installed.  All this can be done with the
RPM utility; see <A
HREF="using-rpm.html"
>Section 10.1</A
> for details.</P
