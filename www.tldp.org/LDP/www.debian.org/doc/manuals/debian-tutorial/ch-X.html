Debian Tutorial (Obsolete Documentation)
<br>Chapter 10 - The X Window System
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
This chapter describes the X Window System graphical user interface.  It
assumes that you have already successfully configured X as described in the
Installation Manual (again, the install manual is not yet written; for now you
will need to use the XFree86 HOWTO, the contents of <samp>/usr/doc/X11</samp>,
and this chapter).  Once you install X, you can enter the X environment by
typing <samp>startx</samp> or via <samp>xdm</samp>, depending on your choice
during configuration.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-X-starting"></a>10.1 Starting the X environment</h2>

<p>
There are two ways of starting X.  The first is to start X manually when you
feel like using it.  To do so, log in to one of the text consoles, and type
<samp>startx</samp>.  This will start X and switch you to its virtual console.
</p>

<p>
The second (and recommended) way to use X is with <code>xdm</code>, or X
Display Manager.  Basically <code>xdm</code> gives you a nice graphical login
prompt on the X virtual console (probably VC 7), and you log in there.
</p>

<p>
By default, either method will also start an <samp>xterm</samp>, which is a
small window containing a shell prompt.  At the shell prompt, you can type any
commands just as you would on a text VC.  So you can follow all the examples in
this tutorial using <samp>xterm</samp>; the only difference between an
<samp>xterm</samp> and the text console is that you don't have to log on to the
<samp>xterm</samp>, since you already logged on to X.
</p>

<p>
There are also a lot of things you can do only in X, which are covered in this
chapter.
</p>

<p>
One note: the default <samp>xterm</samp> has a smallish font.  If you have a
small monitor or very high resolution or bad eyesight, you may want to fix
this.  Follow these steps:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
Move the mouse pointer into the center of the <samp>xterm</samp> window.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
Hold down the <samp>Control</samp> key and the <em>right</em> mouse button
simultaneously.  This will give you a font menu.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
<p>
Point to the font you want and release the mouse button.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="s-X-intro"></a>10.2 Intro: What is X</h2>

<p>
A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is part and parcel of the Windows or Mac
operating systems.  It's basically impossible to write an application for those
systems which does not use the GUI, and the systems can't be used effectively
from the command line.  GNU/Linux is more <em>modular</em>, that is, made up of
many small, independent components which can be used or not according to one's
needs and preferences.  One of these components is the X Window System, or
simply X[<a href="footnotes.html#f14" name="fr14">14</a>].
</p>

<p>
X itself is a means for programs to talk to your mouse and video card, without
knowing what kind of mouse and video card you have.  That is, it's an
<em>abstraction</em> of the graphics hardware.  User applications talk to X, in
X's language; X then translates into the language of your particular hardware.
This means that programs only have to be written once, and they work on
everyone's computer.
</p>

<p>
In X jargon, the program which speaks to the hardware is known as an <em>X
server</em>.  User applications that ask the X server to show windows or
graphics on the screen are called <em>X clients</em>.  The X server includes a
<em>video driver</em>, so you must have an X server which matches your video
card.
</p>

<p>
The X server doesn't provide any of the features one might expect from a GUI,
such as resizing and rearranging windows.  A special X client, called a
<em>window manager</em>, draws borders and titlebars for windows, resizes and
arranges windows, and provides facilities for starting other X clients from a
menu.  Specific window managers may have additional features.
</p>

<p>
Window managers available on a Debian system include <samp>fvwm</samp>,
<samp>fvwm2</samp>, <samp>icewm</samp>, <samp>afterstep</samp>,
<samp>olvwm</samp>, <samp>wmaker</samp>, <samp>mwm</samp>, <samp>twm</samp>,
<samp>enlightenment</samp> and others.  You'll probably want to try them all
and pick your favorite.  (For information on window managers, and other fun
stuff about X, <code><a href="http://www.x11.org">X11.org</a></code> is a nice
site.)
</p>

<p>
Neither the X server nor the window manager provide a <em>file manager</em>;
that is, there aren't any windows containing icons for your files and
directories.  You can launch a file manager as a separate application; there
are many of them available, though unfortunately there aren't yet any good
icon-based ones.  The GNOME desktop project is developing an icon-based file
manager and other GUI facilities, however.  See <code><a
href="http://www.gnome.org">the GNOME project home page</a></code> for the
latest news on this.
</p>

<p>
A final feature of X is its <em>network transparency</em>, meaning that X
clients don't care if they're talking to an X server on the same machine or an
X server somewhere on the network.  In practical terms, this means you can run
a program on a more powerful remote machine, but display it on your desktop
computer.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-X-basics"></a>10.3 Basic X operations</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s-X-basics-mouse"></a>10.3.1 The mouse</h3>

<p>
The mouse in X works pretty much the same as the mouse on other systems, except
that it has three buttons.  If your mouse only has two, you can simulate the
third (middle) button by clicking both buttons simultaneously.  This is kind of
tricky and annoying, so investing in a $15 3-button mouse probably isn't a bad
idea.  These are available from just any computer retailer.
</p>

<p>
The buttons are numbered from left to right, assuming you have a right-handed
mouse, so button one is on the left, two in the middle, three on the right.
You may see either the numbers or the locations in documentation.
</p>

<p>
X has a simple built-in copy-and-paste facility.  To select text to copy, you
click and drag with the left mouse button.  This should select the text to
copy, assuming the application you're using has copy-and-paste support.  To
paste the text, you click the middle mouse button in a different X application.
For example, if you receive an email containing an URL, you can select the URL
with the left button, then click in your web browser's &quot;Location&quot;
field with the middle button to paste it in.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s-X-basics-clients"></a>10.3.2 X clients</h3>

<p>
Programs that communicate with the X server are called X clients.  Most of
these programs will ask the X server to display windows on the screen.
</p>

<p>
You start an X client the same way you start any other Debian program.  Simply
type the name of the client on the command line.  Try typing <samp>xterm</samp>
into an existing xterm, and a new xterm client will appear on the screen.
</p>

<p>
You may notice that the original xterm is now useless, since your shell is
waiting for the second xterm to finish.  To avoid this problem, you can run the
X client in the background --- add a <samp>&amp;</samp> after the command name,
like this: <samp>xterm &amp;</samp>.  If you forget, you can place a running
process in the background.  First suspend the process with <samp>C-z</samp>,
and then place it in the background with the <samp>bg</samp> command.
</p>

<p>
If you use a program often, your window manager will generally provide a way to
put that program on a convenient graphical menu.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s-X-basics-trouble"></a>10.3.3 Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>
Sometimes when you launch an X client from a graphical menu, you won't be able
to see any error messages if it fails.  You can find any error messages in the
file <samp>~/.xsession-errors</samp>.
</p>

<h3><a name="s-X-basics-leaving"></a>10.3.4 Leaving the X environment</h3>

<p>
To leave X, you will need to use a menu.  Unfortunately for beginners, this is
different for every window manager, and for most window managers can be
configured in many ways.  If there's an obvious menu, look for an entry like
&quot;Exit&quot; or &quot;Close Window Manager&quot;.  If you don't see a menu,
try clicking each of the mouse buttons on the background of the screen.  If all
else fails, you can forcibly kill the X server by pressing
<samp>C-A-Backspace</samp>.  Forcibly killing the server will destroy any
unsaved data in open applications.

<h2><a name="s-X-startup"></a>10.4 Customizing your X startup</h2>

<p>
When you start X, Debian will run some shell scripts which start your window
manager and other X clients.  By default, a window manager, an
<samp>xconsole</samp> and an <samp>xterm</samp> will be started for you.
</p>

<p>
To customize your X startup, the file <samp>/etc/X11/config</samp> must contain
the line <samp>allow-user-xsession</samp>.  If it does not, become root and add
the line now.  Then log back in as yourself and continue the tutorial.  [<a
href="footnotes.html#f15" name="fr15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
To run the clients of your choice when X starts, you create an executable shell
script called <samp>.xsession</samp> in your home directory.
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
<samp>touch ~/.xsession</samp>
</p>

<p>
This creates the file.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
<samp>chmod u+x ~/.xsession</samp>
</p>

<p>
Make the file executable.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once <samp>.xsession</samp> is created, you need to edit it to do something
useful with your favorite text editor.  You can do anything you want to in this
script.  However, when the script's process terminates, X will also terminate.
</p>

<p>
In practical terms this means that you often end the script with a call to
<samp>exec</samp>.  Whatever program you <samp>exec</samp> will replace the
script process with itself, so commands found after the <samp>exec</samp> line
will be ignored.  The program you exec will become the new &quot;owner&quot; of
the script process, which means that X will terminate when this new program's
process terminates.
</p>

<p>
Say you end your .xsession with the line: <samp>exec fvwm</samp>.  This means
that the <samp>fvwm</samp> window manager will be run when X starts.  When you
quit the fvwm window manager, your X session will end and all other clients
will be shut down.  You do not have to use a window manager here; you could
<samp>exec xterm</samp>, in which case typing <samp>exit</samp> in that
particular xterm would cause the entire X session to end.
</p>

<p>
If you want to run other clients before doing your <samp>exec</samp>, you will
need to run them in the background.  Otherwise <samp>.xsession</samp> will
pause until each client exits, then continue to the next line.  See the
previous section on running jobs in the background (basically you want to put
an ampersand at the end, e.g.  <samp>xterm &amp;</samp>).
</p>

<p>
You can take advantage of this behavior, though.  If you want to run commands
at the end of your X session, you can have your <samp>.xsession</samp> run a
window manager or the like and wait for it to finish.  That is, leave off the
<samp>exec</samp> and the <samp>&amp;</samp>, just put <samp>fvwm</samp> by
itself.  Then put the commands of your choice after <samp>fvwm</samp>.
</p>

<p>
It would probably help to look at a few sample <samp>.xsession</samp> files.
In all the examples, replace <samp>fvwm</samp> with the window manager of your
choice.
</p>

<p>
The simplest <samp>.xsession</samp> just runs a window manager:
</p>

<pre>
     exec fvwm
</pre>

<p>
This will run fvwm, and the X session will end when fvwm exits.  If you do it
without the <samp>exec</samp>, everything will appear to behave the same way,
but behind the scenes <samp>.xsession</samp> will hang around waiting for fvwm,
and <samp>.xsession</samp> will exit after fvwm does.  Using <samp>exec</samp>
is slightly better because fvwm replaces <samp>.xsession</samp> instead of
leaving it waiting.  You can use the <samp>ps</samp> or <samp>top</samp>
command to verify this.
</p>

<p>
A more useful <samp>.xsession</samp> runs a few clients before starting the
window manager.  For example, you might want some xterms and an xclock whenever
you start X.  No problem:
</p>

<pre>
     xterm &amp;
     xterm &amp;
     xclock &amp;
     exec fvwm
</pre>

<p>
Two xterms and an xclock start up in the background, and then the window
manager is launched.  When you quit the window manager, you'll also quit X.
</p>

<p>
You might try it without the backgrounding just to see what happens.  Do this:
</p>

<pre>
     xterm
     xclock
     exec fvwm
</pre>

<p>
xterm will start, and wait for you to exit it.  Then xclock will start; you'll
have to exit xclock before fvwm will start.  The commands are run in sequence,
since the script waits for each one to exit.
</p>

<p>
You can use sequential execution to your advantage.  Perhaps you want to keep
track of when you stop working every day:
</p>

<pre>
     xterm &amp;
     xclock &amp;
     fvwm
     date &gt;&gt; ~/logout-time
</pre>

<p>
This will fork off an xterm and an xclock, then run fvwm and wait for it to
finish.  When you exit fvwm, it will move on to the last line, which appends
the current date and time to the file <samp>~/logout-time</samp>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can have a program other than the window manager determine when X
exits:
</p>

<pre>
     xclock &amp;
     fvwm &amp;
     exec xterm
</pre>

<p>
This script will run xclock and fvwm in the background, and then replace itself
with xterm.  When you exit the xterm, your X session will end.
</p>

<p>
The best way to learn how to use <samp>.xsession</samp> is to try some of these
things out.  Again, be sure you use <samp>chmod</samp> to make it executable
--- this is a common error.
