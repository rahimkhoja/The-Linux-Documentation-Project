>/proc is very special in that it is also a virtual filesystem.
  It's sometimes referred to as a process information pseudo-file system.
  It doesn't contain 'real' files but runtime system information
  (e.g. system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration, etc). For this
  reason it can be regarded as a control and information centre for the
  kernel. In fact, quite a lot of system utilities are simply calls to files
  in this directory. For example, 'lsmod' is the same as 'cat
  /proc/modules' while 'lspci' is a synonym for 'cat
  /proc/pci'. By altering files located in this directory you can even
  read/change kernel parameters (sysctl) while the system is running.</P
><P
>The most distinctive thing about files in this directory is the fact
  that all of them have a file size of 0, with the exception of kcore, mtrr
  and self. A directory listing looks similar to the following:</P

>Details of this process can be obtained by looking at the associated
  files in the directory for this process, /proc/460. You might wonder how you
  can see details of a process that has a file size of 0. It makes more sense
  if you think of it as a window into the kernel. The file doesn't
  actually contain any data; it just acts as a pointer to where the actual
  process information resides. For example, a listing of the files in the
  /proc/460 directory looks similar to the following:</P

  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control processor
  access to memory ranges. This is most useful when you have a video (VGA)
  card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining allows bus write
  transfers to be combined into a larger transfer before bursting over the
  PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance of image write operations 2.5
  times or more. The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For these,
  the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs. The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above)
  and K6-3 processors have two MTRRs. These are supported. The AMD Athlon
  family provide 8 Intel style MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs,
  allowing write-combining. These are also supported. The VIA Cyrix III and
  VIA C3 CPUs offer 8 Intel style MTRRs.) For more details regarding mtrr

>binfmt_misc</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;  This handles the kernel support for miscellaneous binary formats.
  binfmt_misc provides the ability to register additional binary formats to
  the kernel without compiling an additional module/kernel. Therefore,
  binfmt_misc needs to know magic numbers at the beginning or the filename
  extension of the binary. It works by maintaining a linked list of structs
  that contain a description of a binary format, including a magic with size
  (or the filename extension), offset and mask, and the interpreter name. On
  request it invokes the given interpreter with the original program as
  argument, as binfmt_java and binfmt_em86 and binfmt_mz do. Since binfmt_misc
  does not define any default binary-formats, you have to register an
  additional binary-format. There are two general files in binfmt_misc and one
  file per registered format. The two general files are register and status.
  To register a new binary format you have to issue the command echo
  :name:type:offset:magic:mask:interpreter: &#62; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register 
  with appropriate name (the name for the /proc-dir entry), offset 
  (defaults to 0, if omitted), magic, mask (which can be omitted, 
  defaults to all 0xff) and last but not least, the interpreter
  that is to be invoked (for example and testing /bin/echo). Type can be M for
  usual magic matching or E for filename extension matching (give extension in
  place of magic). If you do a cat on the file /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status, 
  you will get the current status (enabled/disabled) of binfmt_misc. 
  Change the status by echoing 0 (disables) or 1 (enables) or -1 
  (caution: this clears all previously registered binary
  formats) to status. For example echo 0 &#62; status to disable binfmt_misc
  (temporarily). Each registered handler has an entry in /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc. 
  These files perform the same function as status, but their scope is limited 
  to the actual binary format. By 'cating' this file, you also receive 
  all related information about the interpreter/magic of the binfmt. An 
  example of the usage of binfmt_misc (emulate binfmt_java) follows:

  value at 0 will lead to the failure of such a huge malloc(), when in fact
  the system has enough memory for the program to run. On the other hand,

  don't waste memory. It is used on SMP systems so that the system can
  perform fast pagetable allocations without having to acquire the kernel
  memory lock. For large systems, the settings are probably fine. For normal
