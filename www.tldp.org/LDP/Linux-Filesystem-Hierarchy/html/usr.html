>&#13;/usr usually contains by far the largest share of data on a system. Hence,
this is one of the most important directories in the system as it contains
all the user binaries, their documentation, libraries, header files, etc....
X and its supporting libraries can be found here. User programs like telnet, 
ftp, etc.... are also placed here. In the original Unix implementations, /usr
was where the home directories of the users were placed (that is to say, 
/usr/someone was then the directory now known as /home/someone). In current 
Unices, /usr is where user-land programs and data (as opposed to 'system land' 
programs and data) are. The name hasn't changed, but it's meaning has narrowed 
and lengthened from "everything user related" to "user usable programs and data". 
As such, some people may now refer to this directory as meaning 'User System Resources'
and not 'user' as was originally intended.

be shareable between various FHS-compliant hosts and must not be written to.
Any information that is host-specific or varies with time is stored elsewhere.

Large software packages must not use a direct subdirectory under the /usr

>&#13;Another large subdirectory structure begins here, containing libraries, executables, docs, fonts and much more concerning the X Window System. Its inclusion here is somewhat inconsistent and so is the difference between '/usr' and '/usr/X11R6' directories. One would assume that programs that run on X only have their files in the '/usr/X11R6' hierarchy, while the others use '/usr'. Regrettably, it isn't so. KDE and GNOME put their files in the '/usr' hierarchy, whereas the window manager Window Maker uses '/usr/X11R6'. Documentation files for X11R6 are not in '/usr/X11R6/doc', but primarily in '/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc'. This mess is due to the fact that in contrast to other operating systems, the graphical desktop isn't an integral part of the system. Linux is still primarily used on servers, where graphical systems don't make sense.</P

>&#13;The original idea behind '/usr/local' was to have a separate ('local') '/usr' directory on every machine besides '/usr', which might be just mounted read-only from somewhere else. It copies the structure of '/usr'. These days, '/usr/local' is widely regarded as a good place in which to keep self-compiled or third-party programs.

The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for programs and data that are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in /usr. Locally installed software must be placed within /usr/local rather than /usr unless it is being  installed to replace or upgrade software in /usr.

>&#13;man1: User programs
Manual pages that describe publicly accessible commands are contained 
in this chapter. Most program documentation that a user will need to 
use is located here.

man2: System calls
This section describes all of the system calls (requests for the kernel 
to perform operations).

man3: Library functions and subroutines 
Section 3 describes program library routines that are not direct calls 
to kernel services. This and chapter 2 are only really of interest to
programmers.

man4: Special files
Section 4 describes the special files, related driver functions, and 
networking support available in the system. Typically, this includes 
the device files found in /dev and the kernel interface to networking 
protocol support.

man5: File formats
The formats for many data files are documented in the section 5. This 
includes various include files, program output files, and system files.

man6: Games
This chapter documents games, demos, and generally trivial programs.
Different people have various notions about how essential this is.

man7: Miscellaneous Manual pages that are difficult to classify are 
designated as being section 7. The troff and other text processing 
macro packages are found here.

man8: System administration Programs used by system administrators
for system operation and maintenance are documented here. Some of
these programs are also occasionally useful for normal users.
