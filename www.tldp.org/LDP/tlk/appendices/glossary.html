<DL compact>	<dt><b>Argument</b></dt><dd> Functions and routines are passed arguments to process.
	<dt><b>ARP</b></dt><dd> Address Resolution Protocol.  Used to translate IP addresses into
		physical hardware addresses.
	<dt><b>Ascii</b></dt><dd> American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  Each letter
		of the alphabet is represented by an 8 bit code.  Ascii is most often
 		used to store written characters.
	<dt><b>Bit</b></dt><dd> A single bit of data that represents either 1 or 0 (on or off).
	<dt><b>Bottom Half Handler</b></dt><dd> Handlers for work queued within the kernel.
	<dt><b>Byte</b></dt><dd> 8 bits of data,
	<dt><b>C</b></dt><dd> A high level programming language.  Most of the Linux kernel is written
		in C.
	<dt><b>CISC</b></dt><dd> Complex Instruction Set Computer.  The opposite of <em>RISC</em>, a processor
		which supports a large number of often complex assembly instructions.  The X86
		architecture is a CISC architecture.
	<dt><b>CPU</b></dt><dd> Central Processing Unit.  The main engine of the computer, see also
		<em>microprocessor</em> and <em>processor</em>.
	<dt><b>Data Structure</b></dt><dd> This is a set of data in memory comprised of fields,
	<dt><b>Device Driver</b></dt><dd> The software controlling a particular device, for example the
		NCR 810 device driver controls the NCR 810 SCSI device.
	<dt><b>DMA</b></dt><dd> Direct Memory Access.
	<dt><b>ELF</b></dt><dd> Executable and Linkable Format.  This object file format designed
		by the Unix System Laboratories is now firmly established as the most
		commonly used format in Linux.	
	<dt><b>EIDE</b></dt><dd> Extended IDE.
	<dt><b>Executable image</b></dt><dd> A structured file containing machine instructions and data.
		This file can be loaded into a process's virtual memory and executed.
		See also <em>program</em>.
	<dt><b>Function</b></dt><dd> A piece of software that performs an action.  For example, returning
		the bigger of two numbers.
	<dt><b>IDE</b></dt><dd> Integrated Disk Electronics.
	<dt><b>Image</b></dt><dd> See <em>executable image</em>.
	<dt><b>IP</b></dt><dd> Internet Protocol.
	<dt><b>IPC</b></dt><dd> Interprocess Communiction.
	<dt><b>Interface</b></dt><dd> A standard way of calling routines and passing data structures.
		For example, the interface between two layers of code might be expressed
		in terms of routines that pass and return a particular data structure.
		Linux's VFS is a good example of an interface.
	<dt><b>IRQ</b></dt><dd> Interrupt Request Queue.
	<dt><b>ISA</b></dt><dd> Industry Standard Architecture.  This is a standard, although now rather
		dated, data bus interface for system components such as floppy disk
		drivers.
	<dt><b>Kernel Module</b></dt><dd> A dynamically loaded kernel function such as a filesystem or a 
		device driver.
	<dt><b>Kilobyte</b></dt><dd> A thousand bytes of data, often written as  Kbyte,
	<dt><b>Megabyte</b></dt><dd> A million bytes of data, often written as  Mbyte,
	<dt><b>Microprocessor</b></dt><dd> A very integrated <em>CPU</em>.  
		Most modern CPUs are <em>Microprocessors</em>.
	<dt><b>Module</b></dt><dd> A file containing CPU instructions in the form of either assembly
		language instructions or a high level language like C.
	<dt><b>Object file</b></dt><dd> A file containing machine code and data that has not yet been linked
		with other object files or libraries to become an <em>executable image</em>.
	<dt><b>Page</b></dt><dd> Physical memory is divided up into equal sized pages.
	<dt><b>Pointer</b></dt><dd> A location in memory that contains the address of another location
		in memory,
	<dt><b>Process</b></dt><dd> This is an entity which can execute <em>programs</em>.  A process could
		be thought of as a <em>program</em> in action.
	<dt><b>Processor</b></dt><dd> Short for Microprocessor, equivalent to <em>CPU</em>.
	<dt><b>PCI</b></dt><dd> Peripheral Component Interconnect.  A standard describing how the peripheral
		components of a computer system may be connected together.
	<dt><b>Peripheral</b></dt><dd> An intelligent processor that does work on behalf of the system's
		CPU.  For example, an IDE controller chip,
	<dt><b>Program</b></dt><dd> A coherent set of CPU instructions that performs a task, such as
		printing ``hello world''.  See also <em>executable image</em>.
	<dt><b>Protocol</b></dt><dd> A protocol is a networking <em>language</em> used to transfer application data
		between two cooperating processes or network layers.
	<dt><b>Register</b></dt><dd> A location within a chip, used to store information or instructions.
	<dt><b>Register File</b></dt><dd> The set of registers in a processor.
	<dt><b>RISC</b></dt><dd> Reduced Instruction Set Computer.  The opposite of <em>CISC</em>, that is a processor
		with a small number of assembly instructions, each of which performs simple operations.
		The ARM and Alpha processors are both RISC architectures.
	<dt><b>Routine</b></dt><dd> Similar to a function except that, strictly speaking, routines do not
		return values.
	<dt><b>SCSI</b></dt><dd> Small Computer Systems Interface.
	<dt><b>Shell</b></dt><dd> This is a program which acts as an interface between the operating system and
		a human user.   Also called a <em>command shell</em>, the most commonly used shell in
		Linux is the <font face="helvetica">bash</font> shell.
	<dt><b>SMP</b></dt><dd> Symmetrical multiprocessing.  Systems with more than one processor which fairly
		share the work amongst those processors.
	<dt><b>Socket</b></dt><dd> A socket represents one end of a network connection, Linux supports the
			BSD Socket interface.
	<dt><b>Software</b></dt><dd> CPU instructions (both assembler and high level languages like C)
		and data.  Mostly interchangable with <em>Program</em>.
	<dt><b>System V</b></dt><dd> A variant of Unix <sup><font size=-4><tt>T</tt>M</font></sup>&nbsp;produced in 1983, which included, amongst other things,
		<em>System V IPC mechanisms</em>.
	<dt><b>TCP</b></dt><dd> Transmission Control Protocol.
	<dt><b>Task Queue</b></dt><dd> A mechanism for deferring work in the Linux kernel.
	<dt><b>UDP</b></dt><dd> User Datagram Protocol.
	<dt><b>Virtual memory</b></dt><dd> A hardware and software mechanism for making the physical
		memory in a system appear larger than it actually is.
