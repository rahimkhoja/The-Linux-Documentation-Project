>Anyone who is interested in learning about the tools (also known as commands) available to them when using their GNU/Linux based operating system.</P

>Why would you want to learn how to use the command-line (and available tools)? The <EM

>-I</EM
>nterface (CLI), while difficult to learn, is the quickest and most efficient way to use a computer for many different tasks. The CLI is the normal method of use for most <SPAN

> system administrators, programmers and some power users. While a <SPAN

> is better suited to some tasks, many operations are best suited to the CLI.</P

>The major motivation behind learning the GNU/Linux CLI is the authors idea that, with software in general, the more time spent learning something equals less time spent performing that particular task <EM

>This guide is aimed at beginners to intermediate users who want to learn about the command-line tools available to them. Advanced users may wish to use it as a command reference, however this document aims to list commands of interest, as judged by the authors opinion, it is not designed to be completely comprehensive, see the appendix, <A

>Section A.2.1</A
> for further information. Or if you are not looking for a command reference guide, but a more gentle introduction to GNU/Linux you may be interested in the <A
