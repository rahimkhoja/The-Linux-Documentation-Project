>Chapter 3. The Unix Tools Philosophy</H1
><P
>A tool is a simple program, usually designed for a specific purpose, it is sometimes referred to (at least throughout this document) as a command.</P
><P
>The &#8220; Unix tools philosophy&#8221; emerged during the creation of the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UNIX</SPAN
> operating system, after the breakthrough invention of the pipe '|' (refer to <A
HREF="directing-input-ouput.html"
>Chapter 6</A
> for information on using the pipe).</P
><P
>The pipe allowed the output of one program to be sent to the input of another. The tools philosophy was to have small programs to accomplish a particular task instead of trying to develop large monolithic programs to do a large number of tasks. To accomplish more complex tasks, tools would simply be connected together, using pipes.</P
><P
>All the core UNIX system tools were designed so that they could operate together. The original text-based editors (and even <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>TeX</SPAN
> and LaTeX) use <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>ASCII</SPAN
> (the American text encoding standard; an open standard) and you can use tools such as; <EM
>sed</EM
>, <EM
>awk</EM
>, <EM
>vi</EM
>, <EM
>grep</EM
>, <EM
>cat</EM
>, <EM
>more</EM
>, <EM
>tr</EM
> and various other text-based tools in conjunction with these editors. </P
><P
>Using this philosophy programmers avoided writing a program (within their larger program) that had already been written by someone else (this could be considered a form of code recycling). For example, command-line spell checkers are used by a number of different applications instead of having each application create its own own spell checker.</P
><P
>This philosophy lives on today in GNU/Linux and various other <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>UNIX</SPAN
> system-based operating systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, etc.).</P
