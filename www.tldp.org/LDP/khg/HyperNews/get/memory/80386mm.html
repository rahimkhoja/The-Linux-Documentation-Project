<h3>80386 Memory Management</h3>

<p>A logical address specified in an instruction is first
translated to a linear address by the segmenting hardware. This
linear address is then translated to a physical address by the
paging unit.

<h4>Paging on the 386</h4>

<p>There are two levels of indirection in address translation
by the paging unit. A <b>page directory</b> contains pointers
to 1024 page tables. Each <b>page table</b> contains pointers
to 1024 pages. The register CR3 contains the physical base
address of the page directory and is stored as part of the TSS
in the <tt>task_struct</tt> and is therefore loaded on each
task switch.

<p>A 32-bit Linear address is divided as follows:<br>
<table border>
<tr><th>31 ...... 22</th><th>21 ...... 12</th><th>11 ...... 0</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">DIR</td><td align="center">TABLE</td><td align="center">OFFSET</td></tr>
</table><br>
Physical address is then computed (in hardware) as:<br>
<table border>
<tr><td align="right">CR3 + DIR</td><td>points to the table_base.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">table_base + TABLE</td><td>points to the page_base.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">physical_address =</td><td>page_base + OFFSET</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Page directories (page tables) are page aligned so the lower
12 bits are used to store useful information about the page
table (page) pointed to by the entry.

<p>Format for Page directory and Page table entries:<br>
<table border>
<tr><th>31 ...... 12</th><th>11 .. 9</th><th>8</th><th>7</th><th>6</th><th>5</th><th>4</th><th>3</th><th align="center">2</th><th align="center">1</th><th>0</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">ADDRESS</td><td align="center">OS</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>D</td><td>A</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>U/S</td><td>R/W</td><td>P</td></tr>
</table><br>
<table>
<tr><td>D</td><td>1 means page is dirty (undefined for page directory entry).</td></tr>
<tr><td>R/W</td><td>0 means readonly for user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>U/S</td><td>1 means user page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>1 means page is present in memory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>1 means page has been accessed (set to 0 by aging).</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS</td><td>bits can be used for LRU etc, and are defined by the OS.</td></tr>
</table><br>
The corresponding definitions for Linux are in <tt><linux/mm.h></tt>.

<p>When a page is swapped, bits 1-31 of the page table entry
are used to mark where a page is stored in swap (bit 0 must be
0).

<p>Paging is enabled by setting the highest bit in CR0. <b>[in
head.S?]</b> At each stage of the address translation access
permissions are verified and pages not present in memory and
protection violations result in page faults.  The fault handler
(in memory.c) then either brings in a new page or
unwriteprotects a page or does whatever needs to be done.


<h4>Page Fault handling Information</h4>

<ul>
<li>The register CR2 contains the linear address that caused
the last page fault.
<li>Page Fault Error Code (16 bits):<br>
<table border>
<tr><td align="center">bit</td><td>cleared</td><td>set</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">0</td><td>page not present</td><td>page level protection</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td>fault due to read</td><td>fault due to write</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td><td>supervisor mode</td><td>user mode</td></tr>
</table><br>
The rest are undefined. These are extracted in sys_call.S.
</ul>

<p>The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a hardware cache
for physical addresses of the most recently used virtual
addresses. When a virtual address is translated the 386 first
looks in the TLB to see if the information it needs is
available. If not, it has to make a couple of memory references
to get at the page directory and then the page table before it
can actually get at the page. Three physical memory references
for address translation for every logical memory reference
would kill the system, hence the TLB.

<p>The TLB is flushed if CR3 loaded or by task switch that
changes CR0. It is explicitly flushed in Linux by calling
<tt>invalidate()</tt> which just reloads CR3.

<h4>Segments in the 80386</h4>

<p>Segment registers are used in address translation to
generate a linear address from a logical (virtual) address.<br>
<tt>linear_address = segment_base + logical_address</tt><br>
The linear address is then translated into a physical address
by the paging hardware.

<p>Each segment in the system is described by a 8 byte segment
descriptor which contains all pertinent information (base,
limit, type, privilege).

<p>The segments are:
<dl>
<dt><b>Regular segments</b>
<dd><ul><li>code and data segments</ul>
<dt><b>System segments</b>
<dd><ul>
 <li>(TSS) task state segments
 <li>(LDT) local descriptor tables
</ul>
</dl>

<p><b>Characteristics of system segments</b>
<ul>
<li>System segments are task specific.

<li>There is a Task State Segment (TSS) associated with each task
in the system. It contains the <tt>tss_struct</tt> (sched.h). The size
of the segment is that of the <tt>tss_struct</tt> excluding the
<tt>i387_union</tt> (232 bytes).  It contains all the information necessary
to restart the task.

<li>The LDT's contain regular segment descriptors that are private
to a task.  In Linux there is one LDT per task.  There is room for
32 descriptors in the linux <tt>task_struct</tt>. The normal LDT
generated by Linux has a size of 24 bytes, hence room for only 3
entries as above.  Its contents are:
  <dl>
  <dt>LDT[0]
  <dd>Null (mandatory)
  <dt>LDT[1]
  <dd>user code segment descriptor.
  <dt>LDT[2]
  <dd>user data/stack segment descriptor.
  </dl>

<li>The user segments all have base=0x00 so that the linear address
is the same as the logical address. 
</ul>

<p>To keep track of all these segments, the 386 uses a global
descriptor table (GDT) that is setup in memory by the system
(located by the GDT register).  The GDT contains a segment
descriptors for each task state segment, each local descriptor
tablet and also regular segments. The Linux GDT contains just
two normal segment entries:
<ul>
<li>GDT[0] is the null descriptor. 
<li>GDT[1] is the kernel code segment descriptor.
<li>GDT[2] is the kernel data/stack segment descriptor. 
</ul>
The rest of the GDT is filled with TSS and LDT system descriptors:
<ul>
<li>GDT[3]    ???
<li>GDT[4] = TSS0, GDT[5] = LDT0, 
<li>GDT[6] = TSS1, GDT[7] = LDT1
<li>... etc. ...
</ul>

<p><b>LDT[<i>n</i>] != LDT<i>n</i></b>
<table>
<tr><td align="right">LDT[<i>n</i>]</td><td>= the <i>n</i>th descriptor in the LDT of the current task.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">LDT<i>n</i></td><td>= a descriptor in the GDT for the LDT of the <i>n</i>th task.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The kernel segments have base 0xc0000000 which is where the
kernel lives in the linear view. Before a segment can be used,
the contents of the descriptor for that segment must be loaded
into the segment register. The 386 has a complex set of
criteria regarding access to segments so you can't simply load
a descriptor into a segment register. Also these segment
registers have programmer invisible portions. The visible
portion is what is usually called a segment register: cs, ds,
es, fs, gs, and ss.

<p>The programmer loads one of these registers with a 16-bit
value called a selector. The selector uniquely identifies a
segment descriptor in one of the tables. Access is validated
and the corresponding descriptor loaded by the hardware.

<p>Currently Linux largely ignores the (overly?) complex
segment level protection afforded by the 386. It is biased
towards the paging hardware and the associated page level
protection. The segment level rules that apply to user
processes are
<ol>
<li>A process cannot directly access the kernel data or code segments 
<li>There is always limit checking but given that every user segment 
goes from 0x00 to 0xc0000000 it is unlikely to apply. <b>[This
has changed, and needs updating, please.]</b>
</ol>

<h4>Selectors in the 80386</h4>

<p>A segment selector is loaded into a segment register (cs,
ds, etc.) to select one of the regular segments in the system
as the one addressed via that segment register.

<p>Segment selector Format:
<table border>
<tr><th>15 ...... 3</th><th>2 1</th><th>0</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">index</td><td>TI</td><td>RPL</td></tr>
</table>
<dl>
<dt><b>TI</b> Table indicator:
<dd>0 means selector indexes into GDT<br>
1 means selector indexes into LDT
<dt><b>RPL</b> Privelege level.  Linux uses only two privelege levels.
<dd>0 means kernel<br>
3 means user
</dl>

<p>Examples:
<dl>
<dt><b>Kernel code segment</b>
<dd>TI=0, index=1, RPL=0, therefore selector = 0x08 (GDT[1])
<dt><b>User data segment</b>
<dd>TI=1, index=2, RPL=3, therefore selector = 0x17 (LDT[2])
</dl>

<p>Selectors used in Linux:
<table border>
<tr><th>TI</th><th>index</th><th>RPL</th><th>selector</th><th>segment</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0x08</td><td>kernel code</td><td>GDT[1]</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0x10</td><td>kernel data/stack</td><td>GDT[2]</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>???</td><td>???</td><td>GDT[3]</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>0x0F</td><td>user code</td><td>LDT[1]</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0x17</td><td>user data/stack</td><td>LDT[2]</td></tr>
</table>
Selectors for system segments are not to be loaded directly into
segment registers. Instead one must load the TR or LDTR.

<p>On entry into syscall:
<ul>
<li>ds and es are set to the kernel data segment (0x10)
<li>fs is set to the user data segment (0x17) and is used to access
data pointed to by arguments to the system call.
<li>The stack segment and pointer are  automatically set to ss0 and
esp0 by the interrupt and the old values restored when the syscall returns.
</ul>

<h4>Segment descriptors</h4>

<p>There is a segment descriptor used to describe each
segment in the system. There are regular descriptors and system
descriptors. Here's a descriptor in all its glory. The strange
format is essentially to maintain compatibility with the 286.
Note that it takes 8 bytes.
<table border>
<tr><th>63-54</th><th>55</th><th>54</th><th>53</th><th>52</th><th>51-48</th><th>47</th><th>46</th><th>45</th><th>44-40</th><th>39-16</th><th>15-0</th></tr>

</table>

<p><b>Linux system descriptors:</b><br>
TSS:  P=1, DPL=0, S=0, type=9, limit = 231 room for 1 <tt>tss_struct</tt>.<br>
LDT:  P=1, DPL=0, S=0, type=2, limit = 23  room for 3 segment descriptors.<br>
The base is set during <tt>fork()</tt>. There is a TSS and LDT for each task.

<p><b>Linux regular kernel descriptors:</b> (head.S)<br>
code: P=1, DPL=0, S=1, G=1, D=1, type=a, base=0xc0000000, limit=0x3ffff<br>
data: P=1, DPL=0, S=1, G=1, D=1, type=2, base=0xc0000000, limit=0x3ffff<br>

<p><b>The LDT for task[0] contains:</b> (sched.h)<br>
code: P=1, DPL=3, S=1, G=1, D=1, type=a, base=0xc0000000, limit=0x9f<br>
data: P=1, DPL=3, S=1, G=1, D=1, type=2, base=0xc0000000, limit=0x9f<br>

<p><b> The default LDT for the remaining tasks:</b> (<tt>exec()</tt>)<br>
code: P=1, DPL=3, S=1, G=1, D=1, type=a, base=0, limit= 0xbffff<br>
data: P=1, DPL=3, S=1, G=1, D=1, type=2, base=0, limit= 0xbffff<br>

<p>The size of the kernel segments is 0x40000 pages (4KB pages
since G=1 = 1 Gigabyte). The type implies that the permissions
on the code segment is read-exec and on the data segment is
read-write.

<p><b>Registers associated with segmentation.</b>

<p>Format of segment register: (Only the selector is programmer
visible)
<table border>
<tr><th>16-bit</th><th>32-bit</th><th>32-bit</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>selector</td><td>physical base addr</td><td>segment limit</td><td>attributes </td></tr>
</table>
The invisible portion of the segment register is more
conveniently viewed in terms of the format used in the
descriptor table entries that the programmer sets up. The
descriptor tables have registers associated with them that are
used to locate them in memory. The GDTR (and IDTR) are
initialized at startup once the tables are defined. The LDTR is
loaded on each task switch.

<p><b>Format of GDTR (and IDTR):</b>
<table border>
<tr><th>32-bits</th><th>16-bits</th></tr>
<tr><td>Linear base addr</td><td>table limit</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The TR and LDTR are loaded from the GDT and so have the
format of the other segment registers.  The task register (TR)
contains the descriptor for the currently executing task's TSS.
The execution of a jump to a TSS selector causes the state to
be saved in the old TSS, the TR is loaded with the new
descriptor and the registers are restored from the new TSS.
This is the process used by schedule to switch to various user
tasks.  Note that the field <tt>tss_struct.ldt</tt> contains a
selector for the LDT of that task. It is used to load the LDTR.
(sched.h)

<h4>Macros used in setting up descriptors</h4>

<p>Some assembler macros are defined in sched.h and system.h to
ease access and setting of descriptors. Each TSS entry and LDT
entry takes 8 bytes.

<p><b>Manipulating GDT system descriptors:</b>
<dl>
<dt><tt>_TSS(<i>n</i>)</tt>, <tt>_LDT(<i>n</i>)</tt>
<dd>These provide the index into the GDT for the <i>n</i>'th task.
<dt><tt>_LDT(n)</tt> is stored in the the ldt field of the
<tt>tss_struct</tt> by fork.
<dt><tt>_set_tssldt_desc(n, addr, limit, type)</tt>
<dd><tt>ulong *n</tt> points to the GDT entry to set (see fork.c).<br>
  The segment base (TSS or LDT) is set to 0xc0000000 + <tt>addr</tt>.<br>
  Specific instances of the above are, where ltype refers to the byte
  containing P, DPL, S and type:
  <dl>
  <dt><tt>set_ldt_desc(n, addr)</tt> ltype = 0x82
        <dd>P=1, DPL=0, S=0, type=2 means LDT entry.<br>
        limit = 23 => room for 3 segment descriptors.
  <dt><tt>set_tss_desc(n, addr)</tt> ltype = 0x89
        <dd>P=1, DPL=0, S=0, type = 9, means available 80386 TSS 
        limit = 231 room for 1 tss_struct.
  </dl>

<dt><tt>load_TR(n)</tt>,
<dd><tt>load_ldt(n)</tt> load descriptors for task
number n into the task register and ldt register. 
<dt><tt>ulong get_base (struct desc_struct ldt)</tt>
<dd>gets the base from a descriptor. 
<dt><tt>ulong get_limit (ulong segment)</tt> 
<dd>gets the limit (size) from a segment selector. <br>
Returns the size of the segment in bytes.
<dt><tt>set_base(struct desc_struct ldt, ulong base)</tt>,<br>
<tt>set_limit(struct desc_struct ldt, ulong limit)</tt>
<dd>Will set the base and limit for descriptors (4K granular segments).<br>
The limit here is actually the size in bytes of the segment.

<dt><tt>_set_seg_desc(gate_addr, type, dpl, base, limit)</tt>
<dd>Default values 0x00408000 => D=1, P=1, G=0<br>
Present, operation size is 32 bit and max size is 1M.<br>
<tt>gate_addr</tt> must be a <tt>(ulong *)</tt>
