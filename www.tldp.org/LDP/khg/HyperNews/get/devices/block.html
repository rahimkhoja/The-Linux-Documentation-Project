<h3>Block Device Drivers</h3>

<p><b>[Note: This has not been updated since changes were made
in the block device interface to support block device loadable
modules.  The changes shouldn't make it impossible for you to
apply any of this...]</b>

<p>To mount a filesystem on a device, it must be a block device
driven by a block device driver.  This means that the device
must be a random access device, not a stream device.  In other
words, you must be able to seek to any location on the physical
device at any time.

<p>You do not provide <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt>
routines for a block device.  Instead, your driver uses
<tt>block_read()</tt> and <tt>block_write()</tt>, which are
generic functions, provided by the VFS, which will call the
<b>strategy</b> routine, or <tt>request()</tt> function, which
you write in place of <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> for
your driver.  This strategy routine is also called by the
<b>buffer cache</b>, which is called by the VFS routines, which
is how normal files on normal filesystems are read and written.

<p>Requests for I/O are given by the buffer cache to a routine
called <tt>ll_rw_block()</tt>, which constructs lists of
requests ordered by an <b>elevator algorithm,</b> which sorts
the lists to make accesses faster and more efficient. It, in
turn, calls your <tt>request()</tt> function to actually do the
I/O.

<p>Note that although SCSI disks and CDROMs are considered
block devices, they are handled specially (as are all SCSI
devices).  Refer to <A HREF="scsi.html">Writing a SCSI
Driver</a> for details. (Although SCSI disks and CDROMs are
block devices, SCSI tapes, like other tapes, are generally
character devices.)

<A name="init">
<h4>Initialization</h4></a>

<p>Initialization of block devices is a bit more complex than
initialization of character devices, especially as some
``initialization'' has to be done at compile time.  There is
also a <tt>register_blkdev()</tt> call that corresponds to the
character device <tt>register_chrdev()</tt> call, which the
driver must call to say that it is present, working, and
active.

<h4>The file blk.h</h4>

<p>At the top of your driver code, after all other included
header files, you need to write two lines of code:
<pre>
#define MAJOR_NR <i>DEVICE</i>_MAJOR
#include "blk.h"
</pre>
where <tt><i>DEVICE</i>_MAJOR</tt> is the major number of your
device. drivers/block/blk.h requires the use of the
<tt>MAJOR_NR</tt> define to set up many other defines and
macros for your driver.

<p>Now you need to edit blk.h.  Under <tt>#ifdef MAJOR_NR</tt>,
there is a section of defines that are conditionally included
for certain major numbers, protected by <tt>#elif (MAJOR_NR ==
<i>DEVICE</i>_MAJOR)</tt>.  At the end of this list, you will
add another section for your driver.  In that section, the
following lines are required:
<pre>
#define DEVICE_NAME        "<i>device</i>"
#define DEVICE_REQUEST     do_<i>dev</i>_request
#define DEVICE_ON(device)  /* <i>usually blank, see below</i> */
#define DEVICE_OFF(device) /* <i>usually blank, see below</i> */
#define DEVICE_NR(device)  (MINOR(device))
</pre>

<p><tt>DEVICE_NAME</tt> is simply the device name.  See the
other entries in blk.h for examples.

<p><tt>DEVICE_REQUEST</tt> is your strategy routine, which will
do all the I/O on the device.  See <A href="#strategy">The
Strategy Routine</a> for more details on the strategy routine.

<p><tt>DEVICE_ON</tt> and <tt>DEVICE_OFF</tt> are for devices
that need to be turned on and off, like floppies.  In fact, the
floppy driver is currently the only device driver which uses
these defines.

<p><tt>DEVICE_NR(device)</tt> is used to determine the number
of the physical device from the minor device number.  For
instance, in the <tt>hd</tt> driver, since the second hard
drive starts at minor 64, <tt>DEVICE_NR(device)</tt> is defined
to be <tt>(MINOR(device)&gt;&gt;6)</tt>.

<p>If your driver is interrupt-driven, you will also set
<pre>
#define DEVICE_INTR do_<i>dev</i>
</pre>
which will become a variable automatically defined and used by
the remainder of blk.h, specifically by the <tt>SET_INTR()</tt>
and <tt>CLEAR_INTR</tt> macros.

<p>You might also consider setting these defines:
<pre>
#define DEVICE_TIMEOUT <i>DEV</i>_TIMER
#define TIMEOUT_VALUE <i>n</i>
</pre>
where <tt><i>n</i></tt> is the number of jiffies (clock ticks;
hundredths of a second on Linux/386; thousandths or so on
Linux/Alpha) to time out after if no interrupt is received.
These are used if your device can become ``stuck'': a condition
where the driver waits indefinitely for an interrupt that will
never arrive. If you define these, they will automatically be
used in <tt>SET_INTR</tt> to make your driver time out.  Of
course, your driver will have to be able to handle the
possibility of being timed out by a timer.

<h4>Recognizing PC standard partitions</h4>

<p><b>[Inspect the routines in genhd.c and include detailed,
correct instructions on how to use them to allow your device to
use the standard dos partitioning scheme.  By now, bsd disklabel
and sun's SMD labelling are also supported, and I still haven't
gotten around to documenting this.  Shame on me--but people seem
to have been able to figure it out anyway <tt>:-)</tt>]</b>

<h4>The Buffer Cache</h4>

<p><b>[Here, it should be explained briefly how
<tt>ll_rw_block()</tt> is called, about <tt>getblk()</tt> and
<tt>bread()</tt> and <tt>breada()</tt> and <tt>bwrite()</tt>,
etc. A real explanation of the buffer cache is reserved for the
VFS reference section. Jean-Marc Lugrin wrote one, but I can't
find him now.]</b>

<A name="strategy">
<h4>The Strategy Routine</h4></a>

<p>All reading and writing of blocks is done through the
<b>strategy routine</b>.  This routine takes no arguments and
returns nothing, but it knows where to find a list of requests
for I/O (<tt>CURRENT</tt>, defined by default as
<tt>blk_dev[MAJOR_NR].current_request</tt>), and knows how to
get data from the device into the blocks.  It is called with
interrupts <b>disabled</b> so as to avoid race conditions, and
is responsible for turning on interrupts with a call to
<tt>sti()</tt> before returning.

<p>The strategy routine first calls the <tt>INIT_REQUEST</tt>
macro, which makes sure that requests are really on the request
list and does some other sanity checking.
<tt>add_request()</tt> will have already sorted the requests in
the proper order according to the elevator algorithm (using an
insertion sort, as it is called once for every request), so the
strategy routine ``merely'' has to satisfy the request, call
<tt>end_request(1)</tt>, which will take the request off the
list, and then if there is still another request on the list,
satisfy it and call <tt>end_request(1)</tt>, until there are no
more requests on the list, at which time it returns.

<p>If the driver is interrupt-driven, the strategy routine need
only schedule the first request to occur, and have the
interrupt-handler call <tt>end_request(1)</tt> and the call the
strategy routine again, in order to schedule the next request.
If the driver is not interrupt-driven, the strategy routine may
not return until all I/O is complete.

<p>If for some reason I/O fails permanently on the current
request, <tt>end_request(0)</tt> must be called to destroy the
request.

<p>A request may be for a read or write.  The driver determines
whether a request is for a read or write by examining
<tt>CURRENT-&gt;cmd</tt>.  If <tt>CURRENT-&gt;cmd == READ</tt>,
the request is for a read, and if <tt>CURRENT-&gt;cmd ==
WRITE</tt>, the request is for a write.  If the device has
seperate interrupt routines for handling reads and writes,
<tt>SET_INTR(<i>n</i>)</tt> must be called to assure that the
proper interrupt routine will be called.

<p><b>[Here I need to include samples of both a polled strategy
routine and an interrupt-driven one.  The interrupt-driven one
should provide seperate read and write interrupt routines to
show the use of <tt>SET_INTR</tt>.]</b>
