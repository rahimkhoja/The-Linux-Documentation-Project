<P>Hi, i've written a device driver for a cdrom device. It's old. 
I know. But i keep getting compaints that it doesn't work reliably.
</P>

<P>It used to work OK in the old 1.3.fourties. Since more modern 
kernel version, it tended to break more often. Read errors...
</P>

<P>I spent days tracking down the bug, it appeared that the 
driver was woken without an interrupt occurring, 
or my own time-out causing the wake-up. I was stymied. 
</P>

<P>Now i posted a message similar to this to the kernel list 
half a year ago. But i wasn't capable of reading the list 
(sorry) because i use my e-mail address at work. Apparently,
there was some short reaction that my go_to_sleep routine
should do something like
</P>

<P>
<PRE>	while(!my_interrupt_woke_me)
		sleep_on(&amp;wait)
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Why is this? Why does the kernel wake me up if i didn't 
ask for it (i.e., no interrupt occured and no time-out occurred)
</P>

<P>I found out that the sleep_on() could immediately wakeup (i.e.,
not go to sleep) for many times in a row. I had to hack
around by trying to go to sleep up to 100 times, but
i am not charmed by the hack. 
</P>

<P>Does it have to do with the (new?) macros
DEVICE_TIMEOUT and TIMEOUT_VALUE
that i've _not_ defined (because i wrote it in the KHG 0.5 
days...).
</P>

<P>Thanks,
</P>
