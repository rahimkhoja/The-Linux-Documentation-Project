I've never hacked the Linux kernel before, and I'm not very experienced in C++ at all, but I am a man on a mission.
<P>

I've got a Thinkpad 760E, and the modem simply will not work in Linux. It's a nasty little peice of hardware, IBM's 'Mwave' soundcard/modem combo... and I've finally gotten tired of waiting for someone to come out with support for it, so I'm going to try and do it myself... I probably won't get anywhere, but I'm going to try.
<P>

The only source of information I have right now is the the Win95 driver, and since I don't know assembly that's not very informative at all. I'm trying to get IBM to give me some kind of specs for it, but so far I've gotten nowhere.
<P>

The more I think about it the more I realize I'm never going to get anywhere. But I'm desperate. Linux without a modem is rather pointless for me, and after spending $3,999 on this computer, I don't have the change lying around to buy an external modem...
<P>

So anyway, my question is ... where do I start? I know bits and peices of C++, and have never played with the kernel code before. Thanks a lot. Sorry, but I really honestly have no clue how to learn about this subject.
