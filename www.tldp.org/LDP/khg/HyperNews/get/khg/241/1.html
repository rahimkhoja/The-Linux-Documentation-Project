There  are several possible solutions
<P>

i) On kernels before 2.1.xx the kernel uses a different code
segment to user programs. To call user space would
require a far call. The functions get_user and put_user
similarly use a segment override to access user space. Calls are far more complicated because (for protection) the
processor won't allow a user routine to return to a more
priveleged code segment. The best way round this would
be to use a similar method to signal handlers i.e. setup a 
routine on the stack which on return from the signal
handler executes a system call which returns to kernel mode. See arch/i386/kernel/signal.c for more information.  
<P>

The problem is further complicated because on the i386
executing a system call will restore the default kernel stack. The vm86 routines allocate a new kernel stack so when a GPF happens in vm86 mode they can restore the original stack and return to the caller process. You may be able to use a similar method. 
<P>

ii) On kernels after 2.1.xx the kernel segment has the same
base as user space. It should be possible to directly
call a user routine and have it return normally. However the
user routine will have normal kernel priveleges (a big security hole!). 
<P>

iii) Use kerneld. If the desired routine can be written as a seperate program then kerneld can be called from kernel mode to execute it. An example is calling the request-routine script when a network connection is attempted. 
<P>

iv) If the calling process is multithreaded then you should
be able to use the ipc semaphores from kernel mode to
signal to another thread to execute the routine.
