Hello All!
<P>

   Here is an interesting/odd problem that has arisen while
trying to setup a large buffer of memory allocated by
a kernel driver to be remapped into user space. The 
driver is for a CCD camera that is DMA and Interrupt
driven system and I am able to get good consistant images
using "memcpy_tofs()". What I would like to do is to
have a large buffer that can be remapped to user space
so that the data can be transferred via the network 
while the CCD is reading out.  The camera DMAs a line 
at a time(1712 bytes) to a kmalloc'ed buffer of 2048 bytes 
and is copied into the remappable buffer when the problem
occurs. Using two different methods I have come up with some really strange results.
<P>

The Problem:
<P>

    When I readout a full frame(~1.3MB of integers), if the
data is realatively uniform there is no problem. But if
the data is not uniform some of the lines will transfer
fine but most will end up with zeros filling up some
or all of the values in the line. This will happen no
matter how many lines are readout at a time.
<P>

The Method:
<P>

I am using the 2.0.33 kernel, initially with Matt
Welsh's bigphysarea and recently using vmalloc and
the example of remapping virtual memory example in
Alessandro Rubini's "Linux Device Drivers". From
what I have been able to determine the values are
good until the copy from the DMA buffer into the
remapped buffer. 
<P>

I am also locking the application memory using the
driver and using SCHED_FIFO for priority scheduling.
The driver functions very well until I start trying
to use the remapped memory.
<P>
