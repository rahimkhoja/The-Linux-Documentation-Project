<blockquote><i>I have read version 0.6 completely but so
much has changed in the 1.3.xx kernels that for
experienced linux kernel hackers KHG no longer
is all that useful.</i></blockquote>

<p>Was the KHG ever <i>really</i> useful for <i>experienced</i>
Linux kernel hackers?  I would guess not.

<blockquote><i>I thinks this is high time we should
do a complete overhaul of KHG so that it reflects
current changes in the linux kernel especially in
the areas such as memory management.</i></blockquote>

<p>I'm glad you phrased it that way.  <b>We</b> should
indeed do a complete overhaul of the KHG.  Here's how
to do this:
as you find disparities, please post them as
responses. Those responses will be used to update
the KHG.  Without those responses, the updates <b>will
not</b> happen except as I happen to notice the
disparities, which doesn't happen much.  Without
<b>your</b> help, the KHG will remain hopelessly
mired in the past.

<p>If you look at the pages, you will see that kind
readers have already started this process.  To everyone
who has contributed a change, fix, elucidation, update,
or whatever, thank you very much!  Keep up the good
work, everyone, and we'll have a document worth reading.
