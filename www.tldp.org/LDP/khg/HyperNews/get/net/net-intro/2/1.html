Hmm.... I'm not sure why you would want to do this personally. If alloc_skb() returns NULL, there is no memory to allocate the block you want. Normally you would report the squeeze and drop the data.
<P>

When you pass the skb to netif_rx you are esentially saying "here you go". You cant expect to reclaim the buffer as it will eventually be freed.
<P>

If you must make a best effort to deliver the data regardless of the memory situation at the time the data is received (the interrupt handler), I would create an skb list when the driver loads. Then during the interrupt, try to alloc_skb and if it fails, stuff the data in one of the pre-alloced buffers. Then the next time an interrupt occurs, try to replenish the buffer pool.
<P>

If you get to a point where both the alloc_skb fails and the buffer pool is empty, you're pretty much screwed anyways.
<P>

This would solve short-term squeeze situations but if you are that tight for memory, you might want to just printk a message saying "Get more memory cheapskate" or words to that effect.
<P>

If you're smart about it, you could balance the buffer pool at interrupt time to ensure you have enough to do the job. If you're using a good number of the buffers continuously, you might want to dynamically increase the number of buffers in the pool. If you aren't, you could reduce the number dynamically.
<P>

Just a thought.
