<p>In order to add another source to this page, simple respond
to the page and mention the source.  You <b>can</b>, if you
like, simply type in the URL as your response--just click
on the <b>Respond</b> button, enter the title of the web
page you are connecting to in the <b>Title</b> box, click
on the URL radiobutton for the <b>format</b>, and then type the
URL into the large text window entitled <b>Enter your
response here:</b>.

<p>That is all that is <i>required</i>.  Just click the
<b>Preview Response</b> button, and then if it looks
right, submit it by clicking on the <b>Post your Response</b>
button.

<p>If you want to be notified of further changes made to
this page, you can <b>subscribe</b> to it.  Subscribing
makes you a member, with special privileges, and <i>also</i>
puts you on a mailing list.  Click on the
<b>Membership</b> item at the bottom.  Members can also
edit their posts if they want to make changes later.
Also, the more members there are, the more motivated I
will be to maintain this new version of the KHG...
<tt>:-)</tt>

<p>If you aren't subscribed, you should probably leave
your name and email address, and possibly home page if
you have one.

<p>At some point, the URL may be moved from the response
list into the body of the article.  If that sentence didn't
make sense to you, you can safely ignore it.

<p>Thank you for your help!
