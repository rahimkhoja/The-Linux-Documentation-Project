          5. Typography
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        To make things easier to follow, there are a few typographical
        conventions used throughout this book. This section contains some
        examples of the typographical format found throughout Linux From
        Scratch.
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">./configure --prefix=/usr</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        This form of text is designed to be typed exactly as seen unless
        otherwise noted in the surrounding text. It is also used in the
        explanation sections to identify which of the commands is being
        referenced.
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><tt class=
      "computeroutput">install-info: unknown option '--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</tt></pre>
      <p>
        This form of text (fixed-width text) shows screen output, probably as
        the result of commands issued. This format is also used to show
        filenames, such as <tt class="filename">/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Emphasis</em></span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This form of text is used for several purposes in the book. Its main
        purpose is to emphasize important points or items.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/"><i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/</i></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This format is used for hyperlinks both within the LFS community and
        to external pages. It includes HOWTOs, download locations, and
        websites.
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class="literal">root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
......</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        This format is used when creating configuration files. The first
        command tells the system to create the file <tt class=
        "filename">$LFS/etc/group</tt> from whatever is typed on the
        following lines until the sequence end of file (EOF) is encountered.
        Therefore, this entire section is generally typed as seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em class="replaceable"><tt>[REPLACED TEXT]</tt></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This format is used to encapsulate text that is not to be typed as
        seen or copied-and-pasted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <tt class="filename">passwd(5)</tt>
      </p>
      <p>
        This format is used to refer to a specific manual page (hereinafter
        referred to simply as a &ldquo;<span class="quote">man</span>&rdquo;
        page). The number inside parentheses indicates a specific section
        inside of <span><strong class="command">man</strong></span>. For
        example, <span><strong class="command">passwd</strong></span> has two
        man pages. Per LFS installation instructions, those two man pages
        will be located at <tt class=
        "filename">/usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1</tt> and <tt class=
        "filename">/usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5</tt>. Both man pages have
        different information in them. When the book uses <tt class=
        "filename">passwd(5)</tt> it is specifically referring to <tt class=
        "filename">/usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5</tt>. <span><strong class=
        "command">man passwd</strong></span> will print the first man page it
        finds that matches &ldquo;<span class="quote">passwd</span>&rdquo;,
        which will be <tt class="filename">/usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1</tt>.
        For this example, you will need to run <span><strong class=
        "command">man 5 passwd</strong></span> in order to read the specific
        page being referred to. It should be noted that most man pages do not
        have duplicate page names in different sections. Therefore,
        <span><strong class="command">man <em class=
        "replaceable"><tt>[program name]</tt></em></strong></span> is
        generally sufficient.
