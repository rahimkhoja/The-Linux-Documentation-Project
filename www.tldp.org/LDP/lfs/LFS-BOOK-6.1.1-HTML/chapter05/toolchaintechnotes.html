      <p>
        This section explains some of the rationale and technical details
        behind the overall build method. It is not essential to immediately
        understand everything in this section. Most of this information will
        be clearer after performing an actual build. This section can be
        referred back to at any time during the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall goal of <a href="chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> is to
        provide a temporary environment that can be chrooted into and from
        which can be produced a clean, trouble-free build of the target LFS
        system in <a href="../chapter06/chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>. Along
        the way, we separate the new system from the host system as much as
        possible, and in doing so, build a self-contained and self-hosted
        toolchain. It should be noted that the build process has been
        designed to minimize the risks for new readers and provide maximum
        educational value at the same time.

            Before continuing, be aware of the name of the working platform,
            often referred to as the target triplet. Many times, the target
            triplet will probably be <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>i686-pc-linux-gnu</em></span>. A simple way to
            determine the name of the target triplet is to run the
            <span><strong class="command">config.guess</strong></span> script
            that comes with the source for many packages. Unpack the Binutils
            sources and run the script: <strong class=
            "userinput"><tt>./config.guess</tt></strong> and note the output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also be aware of the name of the platform's dynamic linker, often
            referred to as the dynamic loader (not to be confused with the
            standard linker <span><strong class="command">ld</strong></span>
            that is part of Binutils). The dynamic linker provided by Glibc
            finds and loads the shared libraries needed by a program,
            prepares the program to run, and then runs it. The name of the
            dynamic linker will usually be <tt class=
            "filename">ld-linux.so.2</tt>. On platforms that are less
            prevalent, the name might be <tt class="filename">ld.so.1</tt>,
            and newer 64 bit platforms might be named something else
            entirely. The name of the platform's dynamic linker can be
            determined by looking in the <tt class="filename">/lib</tt>
            directory on the host system. A sure-fire way to determine the
            name is to inspect a random binary from the host system by
            running: <strong class="userinput"><tt>readelf -l &lt;name of
            binary&gt; | grep interpreter</tt></strong> and noting the
            output. The authoritative reference covering all platforms is in
            the <tt class="filename">shlib-versions</tt> file in the root of
            the Glibc source tree.

        Some key technical points of how the <a href="chapter05.html">Chapter

            <p>
              The process is similar in principle to cross-compiling, whereby
              tools installed in the same prefix work in cooperation, and
              thus utilize a little GNU &ldquo;<span class=
              "quote">magic</span>&rdquo;

              Careful manipulation of <span><strong class=

              used
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Binutils is installed first because the <span><strong class=
        "command">configure</strong></span> runs of both GCC and Glibc
        perform various feature tests on the assembler and linker to
        determine which software features to enable or disable. This is more
        important than one might first realize. An incorrectly configured GCC
        or Glibc can result in a subtly broken toolchain, where the impact of
        such breakage might not show up until near the end of the build of an
        entire distribution. A test suite failure will usually highlight this
        error before too much additional work is performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Binutils installs its assembler and linker in two locations,
        <tt class="filename">/tools/bin</tt> and <tt class=
        "filename">/tools/$TARGET_TRIPLET/bin</tt>. The tools in one location
        are hard linked to the other. An important facet of the linker is its
        library search order. Detailed information can be obtained from
        <span><strong class="command">ld</strong></span> by passing it the
        <em class="parameter"><tt>--verbose</tt></em> flag. For example, an
        <strong class="userinput"><tt>ld --verbose | grep
        SEARCH</tt></strong> will illustrate the current search paths and
        their order. It shows which files are linked by <span><strong class=
        "command">ld</strong></span> by compiling a dummy program and passing
        the <em class="parameter"><tt>--verbose</tt></em> switch to the
        linker. For example, <strong class="userinput"><tt>gcc dummy.c
        -Wl,--verbose 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep succeeded</tt></strong> will show
        all the files successfully opened during the linking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next package installed is GCC. An example of what can be seen
        during its run of <span><strong class=
        "command">configure</strong></span> is:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><tt class=
      "computeroutput">checking what assembler to use... 
        /tools/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/as
checking what linker to use... /tools/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld</tt></pre>
      <p>
        This is important for the reasons mentioned above. It also
        demonstrates that GCC's configure script does not search the PATH
        directories to find which tools to use. However, during the actual
        operation of <span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span>
        itself, the same search paths are not necessarily used. To find out
        which standard linker <span><strong class=
        "command">gcc</strong></span> will use, run: <strong class=
        "userinput"><tt>gcc -print-prog-name=ld</tt></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed information can be obtained from <span><strong class=
        "command">gcc</strong></span> by passing it the <em class=
        "parameter"><tt>-v</tt></em> command line option while compiling a
        dummy program. For example, <strong class="userinput"><tt>gcc -v
        dummy.c</tt></strong> will show detailed information about the
        preprocessor, compilation, and assembly stages, including
        <span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span>'s included search
        paths and their order.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next package installed is Glibc. The most important
        considerations for building Glibc are the compiler, binary tools, and
        kernel headers. The compiler is generally not an issue since Glibc
        will always use the <span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span>
        found in a <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> directory. The binary tools
        and kernel headers can be a bit more complicated. Therefore, take no
        risks and use the available configure switches to enforce the correct
        selections. After the run of <span><strong class=
        "command">configure</strong></span>, check the contents of the
        <tt class="filename">config.make</tt> file in the <tt class=
        "filename">glibc-build</tt> directory for all important details. Note
        the use of <em class="parameter"><tt>CC="gcc -B/tools/bin/"</tt></em>
        to control which binary tools are used and the use of the <em class=
        "parameter"><tt>-nostdinc</tt></em> and <em class=
        "parameter"><tt>-isystem</tt></em> flags to control the compiler's
        include search path. These items highlight an important aspect of the
        Glibc package&mdash;it is very self-sufficient in terms of its build
        machinery and generally does not rely on toolchain defaults.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Glibc installation, make some adjustments to ensure that
        searching and linking take place only within the <tt class=
        "filename">/tools</tt> prefix. Install an adjusted
        <span><strong class="command">ld</strong></span>, which has a
        hard-wired search path limited to <tt class=
        "filename">/tools/lib</tt>. Then amend <span><strong class=
        "command">gcc</strong></span>'s specs file to point to the new
        dynamic linker in <tt class="filename">/tools/lib</tt>. This last
        step is vital to the whole process. As mentioned above, a hard-wired
        path to a dynamic linker is embedded into every Executable and Link
        Format (ELF)-shared executable. This can be inspected by running:
        <strong class="userinput"><tt>readelf -l &lt;name of binary&gt; |
        grep interpreter</tt></strong>. Amending gcc's specs file ensures
        that every program compiled from here through the end of this chapter
        will use the new dynamic linker in <tt class=
        "filename">/tools/lib</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need to use the new dynamic linker is also the reason why the
        Specs patch is applied for the second pass of GCC. Failure to do so
        will result in the GCC programs themselves having the name of the
        dynamic linker from the host system's <tt class="filename">/lib</tt>
        directory embedded into them, which would defeat the goal of getting
        away from the host.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the second pass of Binutils, we are able to utilize the
        <em class="parameter"><tt>--with-lib-path</tt></em> configure switch
        to control <span><strong class="command">ld</strong></span>'s library
        search path. From this point onwards, the core toolchain is
        self-contained and self-hosted. The remainder of the <a href=
        "chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> packages all build against the new
        Glibc in <tt class="filename">/tools</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon entering the chroot environment in <a href=
        "../chapter06/chapter06.html">Chapter 6</a>, the first major package
        to be installed is Glibc, due to its self-sufficient nature mentioned
        above. Once this Glibc is installed into <tt class=
        "filename">/usr</tt>, perform a quick changeover of the toolchain
        defaults, then proceed in building the rest of the target LFS system.
