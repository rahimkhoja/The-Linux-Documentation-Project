>&#13;           Because it comes with source code to the kernel, it is quite portable. Linux runs on more CPUs and 
           platforms than any other computer operating system. The recent direction of the software and hardware 
           industry is to push consumers to purchase faster computers with more system memory and hard drive storage. 
           Linux systems are not affected by those industries orientation because of it capacity to run on any kind 
           of computers, even aging x486-based computers with limited amounts of RAM.

>&#13;           Linux is a true multi-tasking operating system similar to its brother UNIX. It uses sophisticated, state-of-the-art 
           memory management to control all system processes. That means that if a program crashes you can kill it and continue 
           working with confidence.
           </P

>&#13;           Another benefit is that Linux is practically immunized against all kinds of viruses that we find in other operating 
           systems. To date we have found only two viruses that were effective on Linux systems.
