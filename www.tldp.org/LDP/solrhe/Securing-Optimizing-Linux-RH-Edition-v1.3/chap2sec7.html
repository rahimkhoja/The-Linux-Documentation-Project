>Linux is an <I
CLASS="firstterm"
>Operating System</I
> that was first created at the
           University of Helsinki in Finland by a young student named Linus Torvalds. At
           this time the student was working on a UNIX system that was running on an
           expensive platform. Because of his low budget, and his need to work at home, he
           decided to create a copy of the UNIX system in order to run it on a less
           expensive platform, such as an IBM PC.  He began his work in 1991 when he
           released version 0.02 and worked steadily until 1994 when version 1.0 of the
           Linux Kernel was released. The current full-featured version at this time is
           2.2.X; released January 25, 1999, and development continues.</P

> General Public License (also known as GNU GPL) and its 
             source code is freely available to everyone who downloads it via the Internet. The CD-ROM version of Linux is 
             also available in many stores, and companies that provide it will charge you for the cost of the media and support. 
             Linux may be used for a wide variety of purposes including networking, software development, and as an end-user 
             platform. Linux is often considered an excellent, low-cost alternative to other more expensive operating systems 
             because you can install it on multiple computers without paying more.
