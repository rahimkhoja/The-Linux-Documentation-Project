>&#13;                           To give back something to the Linux community which has been instrumental in

                       if at all and not Gerhard's. So if you spot some glaring mistakes whether be it in the form of wrong or mis-information, typos or grammatical mistakes  please do inform me at

                       Also welcome are the suggestions on how we could improve on this, so that next time round it will much be better.

>&#13;                       Here is hoping that this proves useful despite those already mentioned, creeped in mistakes, errors <SPAN

>etc.</SPAN
> and it kindles in you the same spirit which has embodied the growth of Linux as a powerful environement to work in.
                       And if that happens i would consider myself highly obliged and this will prove to be a satisfying endevour for me personally. I have a feeling that the orginal author of this book Gerhard Mourani shares this thought of 
                       mine and probably agrees with me.
