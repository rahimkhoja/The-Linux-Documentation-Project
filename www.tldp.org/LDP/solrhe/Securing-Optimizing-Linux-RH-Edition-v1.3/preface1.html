>&#13;                  When I began writing this book, the first question I asked myself was how to 
                  install Linux on a  server, and be sure that no one from the outside, or 
                  inside, could access it without authorization. Then I wondered if any method 
                  similar to the one on <SPAN

>Windows</SPAN
>&reg; exists to improve the computers 
                  performance. Subsequently, I began a search on the Internet and read several books 
                  to get the most information on security and performance for my server. After many 
                  years of research and studies I had finally found the answer to my questions. 
                  These answers were found, all scattered throughout different documents, books, 
                  articles, and Internet sites. I created  documentation based on my research that 
                  could help me through my daily activities.  </P
><P
>Through the years, my documentation grew and started to look more like a book 
                    and less like simple,  scattered notes. I decide to publish it on the Internet so 
                    that anyone could take advantage of it. By sharing this information, I felt that I 
                    was doing my part for the community who answered so many of my computing needs with 
                    one magical, reliable, strong, powerful, fast and free operating system named Linux. 
                    I had received a lot of feedback and comments about my documentation, which helped to 
                    improve it over time.
