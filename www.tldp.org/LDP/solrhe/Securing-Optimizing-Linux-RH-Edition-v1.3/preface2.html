>Is there a need to fiddle with what apparently is perfectly working and is serving the need. Well for one the i have choosen a format, <SPAN

                   in this case has the advantage of source being one  and output can be in various format. That is if the source is in <SPAN

                   prove to the sceptics that DocBook is very much suitable for large production quality projects, not that this is the first effort, in this case an entire book has been marked up in <SPAN

CLASS="acronym"
>XML</SPAN
> -eXtensible Markup Language  has been able to do justice to a large extent to the hype. Maybe having a watch body like w3.org to monitor
                   has been advantageous; unlike HTML which lacked a formal monitoring, ability to extend, a weak structure and no support for validation,  <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>XML</SPAN
> has all these and more. It is a system-independant, vendor-independant and
                   has behind it the proven experience of SGML implementation, XML being a subset of SGML. I concur with Tim Bray's reported comment that it is ridiculous to use an application like MS Word, Quark Express <SPAN
CLASS="abbrev"
>etc.</SPAN
>for writing text which will be stored as a binary 
                   and proprietory format therby bloating it considerably. And unlike <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>HTML</SPAN
> which has about <SPAN
CLASS="abbrev"
>aprox.</SPAN
> 50-60 pre-cooked tags, with <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>XML</SPAN
> one can make up one's own. Infact this facility of having one's own
                   tag will make it very, very useful in the long run. And the inherent factor that <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>XML</SPAN
> is all about content and nothing to do with presentation will be its greatest strength for years to come. The presentation part is taken care of by
                   Stylesheet or FO or some such thing.
