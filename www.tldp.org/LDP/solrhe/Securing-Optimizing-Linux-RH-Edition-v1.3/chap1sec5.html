> but i would like to thank him for collaborating
                         with me in porting ( for the want of a better word).To say he was co-operative will be an under statement he was always there with a helping hand
                         to answer my innumerable queries etc.
                         Also i would like to thank the following people,but not in any particular order;</P

HREF="appendixa.html#prtinxfp1acn"
>http://nwalsh.com/~ndw/</A
> for his phenominal and brilliant contribution to DocBook. To me at times looks like only one man contributing to its growth, popularity  and in the process as well making it a mature 
                           product. Add to that he is a wonderful human being. My many many thanks to him.

> for his Brilliant editor j, i do all my work using it and there are no words to describe it.
                           i am indebted to him. I doubt very much if i could have worked for long stretches without it.

> for his netpbm package and more than any thing for having the patience in dealing with my often persistent and idiotic queries. His software was mainly responsible for converting and manupilating
                           all the orginal images which were in some esoteric format.
