    before asking questions there as noise delays the development.
    Some relevant lists are <TT

>linux-raid</A
>&#62;</TT

    <TT
CLASS="EMAIL"

CLASS="EMAIL"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:linux-ext2fs"
>linux-ext2fs</A
>&#62;</TT
>.  Many
    of the most useful mailing lists run on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>vger.rutgers.edu</TT
> server but this is
    notoriously overloaded, so try to find a mirror. There are some
    lists mirrored at <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com"
TARGET="_top"
>The Redhat
    Home Page</A
>. Many lists are also accessible at <A
HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists"
TARGET="_top"
>linuxhq</A
>, and the
    rest of the web site contains useful information as well.
   </P

    a message with the line <B

CLASS="EMAIL"
>&#60;<A
HREF="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu"
>majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</A
>&#62;</TT
>.
    If you need help on how to use the mail server just send the line
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>help</B
> to the same address.  Due to the
    popularity of this server it is likely it takes a bit to time before
    you get a reply or even get messages after you send a
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>subscribe</B
> command.
   </P

    be of interest such as the EATA driver list

>    In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory
    installed, have a look in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc</TT
>
    directory. where most packages store their main documentation and
    README files etc.  Also you will here find the HOWTO archive 
    (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/HOWTO</TT
>) of ready formatted HOWTOs
    and also the mini-HOWTO archive 
    (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini</TT
>) of plain text
    documents.
   </P
><P
>    Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in
    the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc</TT
> directory. In particular you will
    want to work with the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> file that
    sets up the mounting of partitions and possibly also
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/raidtab</TT
> file that is used for the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>md</TT
> system to set up RAID.
   </P
><P
>    The kernel source in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux</TT
> is, of
    course, the ultimate documentation. In other words, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"use
    the source, Luke"</SPAN
>. It should also be pointed out that the
    kernel comes not only with source code which is even commented
    (well, partially at least) but also an informative
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/Documentation</TT
>. If you are
    about to ask any questions about the kernel you should read this
    first, it will save you and many others a lot of time and
    possibly embarrassment.
   </P
><P
>    Also have a look in your system log file
    (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/log/messages</TT
>) to see what is going on
    and in particular how the booting went if too much scrolled off
    your screen. Using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>tail -f /var/log/messages</B
>
    in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update
    of what is going on in your system.
   </P
><P
>    You can also take advantage of the  <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc</TT
>
    file system that is a window into the inner workings of your
    system. Use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cat</B
> rather than
    <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>more</B
> to view the files as they are reported as
    being zero length. Reports are that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>less</B
> works
    well here.
