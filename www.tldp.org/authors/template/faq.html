>      Q:How many physical disk drives (spindles) does a Linux system need?
     </P
><P
>      A: Linux can run just fine on one drive (spindle).  Having
      enough  RAM (around 32 MB, and up to 64 MB) to support swapping
      is a  better price/performance choice than getting a second
      disk. (E)IDE disk is usually cheaper (but a little slower) than
      SCSI.

>      Q: Are there any disadvantages in this scheme?
     </P
><P
>      A: There is only a minor snag: if even a single partition
      overflows the system might stop working properly. The severity
      depends of course on what partition is affected. Still this is
      not hard to monitor, the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>df</B
> gives
      you a good overview of the situation. Also check the swap
      partition(s) using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>free</B
> to make sure you are
      not about to run out of virtual memory.

><P
>      Q: OK, so should I split the system into as many partitions as 
      possible for a single drive?
     </P
><P
>      A: No, there are several disadvantages to that. First of all
      maintenance becomes needlessly complex and you gain very little
      in this. In fact if your partitions are too big you will seek
      across larger areas than needed. This is a balance and
      dependent on the number of physical drives you have.
