This is a fully working template for big HOWTOs. The source contains
fully described slots to make a convenient framework for you to fill in
for making your own HOWTO, suggesting some names, conventions and contents
for the chapters.

<sect>Introduction

<p> <!-- always use a p tag (paragraph) immediately after a sect tag -->
<nidx>(your index root)!introduction</nidx>   <!-- here introduction is a sub entry of template, exclamationmark is separator -->
<em>My comments to the reader is in this style (emphasized)</em>.
Example lines are in plain roman style.
<em>Note that extra comments and advice is found in comments
within the SGML source.</em> <!-- such as this comment -->

For various reasons this brand new release is codenamed
the <bf/release/ release.

New code names will appear as per industry standard guidelines
to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this document.

<p>
This document was written when I read a feedback asking for a
template to fill in to make new HOWTOs. This template is made
by extracting the skeletal structure of the Multi Disk HOWTO
which is a rather large HOWTO.

<em>This Template is a suggestion and a starting point, a check list
and examples for authors; it is not a requirement to be followed
slavishly. Over time HOWTOs might also outgrow any template since
in the end the goal is to inform readers efficiently.</em>

Stating the background is a simple way to getting started
writing the intro.

First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development shows it is
quite important.

<sect>Structure
<p>
<em>A quick overview on how all parts fit together in the structure.
Here I use an example from my Multi Disk HOWTO.</em>

As this type of document is supposed to be as much for learning
as a technical reference document I have rearranged the structure
to this end. For the designer of a system it is more useful to
have the information presented in terms of the goals of this exercise
than from the point of view of the logical layer structure of the
devices themselves. Nevertheless this document would not be complete
without such a layer structure the computer field is so full of, so
I will include it here as an introduction to how it works.

<sect1>Logical structure
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!structure, I/O subsystem</nidx>
This is based on how each layer access each other, traditionally
with the application on top and the physical layer on the bottom.
It is quite useful to show the interrelationship between each of
the layers used in controlling drives.
<tscreen><verb>
        ___________________________________________________________
        |__     File structure          ( /usr /tmp etc)        __|
        |__     File system             (ext2fs, vfat etc)      __|
        |__     Volume management       (AFS)                   __|
        |__     RAID, concatenation     (md)                    __|
        |__     Device driver           (SCSI, IDE etc)         __|
        |__     Controller              (chip, card)            __|
        |__     Connection              (cable, network)        __|
        |__     Drive                   (magnetic, optical etc) __|
        -----------------------------------------------------------

</verb></tscreen>

In the above diagram both volume management and RAID and concatenation
are optional layers. The 3 lower layers are in hardware.
All parts are discussed at length later on in this document.

<sect1>Document structure
<p>
Most users start out with a given set of hardware and some plans on
what they wish to achieve and how big the system should be. This is
the point of view I will adopt in this document in presenting the
material, starting out with hardware, continuing with design constraints
before detailing the design strategy that I have found to work well.
I have used this both for my own personal computer at home, a multi
purpose server at work and found it worked quite well. In addition my
Japanese co-worker in this project have applied the same strategy on
a server in an academic setting with similar success.

Finally at the end I have detailed some configuration tables for use
in your own design. If you have any comments regarding this or notes
from your own design work I would like to hear from you so this
document can be upgraded.
	
<sect1>Reading plan
<p>
<em>As you go beyond 50 pages or so there will be a lot of text that
experts and even the experienced do not need to read. Keeping in mind
that we wish to care for all kinds of people in the Linux world we
might have to make a reading plan. Again example follows from my
HOWTO.</em>

Although not the biggest HOWTO it is nevertheless rather big already
and I have been requested to make a reading plan to make it possible
to cut down on the volume

<descrip>
<tag/Expert/ (aka the elite). If you are familiar with Linux as well
as disk drive technologies you will find most of what you need in the
appendices. Additionally you are recommended to read the FAQ and the
<ref id="bits-n-pieces" name="Bits'n'pieces">
chapter.

<tag/Experienced/ (aka Competent). If you are familiar with computers
in general you can go straight to the chapters on
<ref id="technologies" name="technologies">
and continue from there on.

<tag/Newbie/ (mostly harmless). You just have to read the whole thing.
Sorry. In addition you are also recommended to read all the other disk
related HOWTOs.
</descrip>


<sect>Technologies <label id="technologies">
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!technologies</nidx>
<em>Introduction of technology for the newbie with a few
references to detailled works. Remember that not everyone
has Internet access so you have to explain in sufficient
details so even the newbie can get by.</em>


<sect>Implementation
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!implementation</nidx>
<em>Now your readers should have a sufficient knowledge of what
this is about and now we come to the hands on of implementing
your clever scheme.</em>


<sect>Maintenance
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!maintenance</nidx>
<em>Few systems and designs are maintenance free, here you explain
how to keep the system running.</em>


<sect>Advanced Issues
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!advanced topics</nidx>
<em>You can get most things up and running in a quick and dirty
fashion, useful for testing and getting used to how things work.
For more serious use you would need to be a little more advanced.
This is the place to explain it all, if applicable.</em>


<sect>Troubleshooting <label id="troubleshooting">
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!troubleshooting</nidx>
<em>Many problems can be solved by a simple structured approach,
analysing the symptoms, finding the cause and determining the
solution. The following is an excerpts from the Multi Disk HOWTO.</em>

<sect1>During Installation

<sect2>Locating Disks
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Symptoms/Cannot find disk
<tag/Problem/How to find what drive letter corresponds to what disk/partition
<tag/Solution/Remember Linux does not use drive letters but device names. More
information can be found in section "Drive names".
</descrip>
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Symptoms/Cannot partition disk
<tag/Problem/Most likely wrong input to the command line for <tt/fdisk/ or similar tool.
<tag/Solution/Remember to use <tt>/dev/hda</tt> rather than just <tt>hda</tt>. Also
do not use numbers behind <tt>hda</tt>, those indicate partitions.
</descrip>


<sect2>Formatting
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Symptoms/Cannot format disk.
<tag/Problem/Strictly speaking you format partitions not disks.
<tag/Solution/Make sure you add the partition number after the device name
of the disk, for instance <tt>/dev/hda1</tt> to the command line.
</descrip>


<sect>Further Information
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources</nidx>
<em>A HOWTO cannot describe everything, some times the user
has to venture out on the net to get more information or just
updates. Here is the place to tell where and how. Again examples
from my HOWTO, replace as needed.</em>
There is wealth of information one should go through when setting up a
major system, for instance for a news or general Internet service provider. 
The FAQs in the following groups are useful:

<sect1>News groups
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!news groups</nidx>
Some of the most interesting news groups are:
<itemize>
<item><url url="news:comp.arch.storage"                   name="Storage">.
<item><url url="news:comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.storage"    name="PC storage">.
<item><url url="news:alt.filesystems.afs"                 name="AFS">.
<item><url url="news:comp.periphs.scsi"                   name="SCSI">.
<item><url url="news:comp.os.linux.setup"                 name="Linux setup">.
</itemize>

Most newsgroups have their own FAQ that are designed to answer most of your
questions, as the name Frequently Asked Questions indicate. Fresh versions
should be posted regularly to the relevant newsgroups. If you cannot find it
in your news spool you could go directly to the
<url url="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu"
    name="FAQ main archive FTP site">. The WWW versions can be browsed at
<url url="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/FAQ-List.html"
    name="FAQ main archive WWW site">.

Some FAQs have their own home site, of particular interest here are
<itemize>
<item><url url="http://www.paranoia.com/&tilde;filipg/HTML/LINK/F&lowbar;SCSI.html"
          name="SCSI FAQ"> and
<item><url url="http://alumni.caltech.edu/&tilde;rdv/comp&lowbar;arch&lowbar;storage/FAQ-1.html"
          name="comp.arch.storage FAQ">.
</itemize>


<sect1>Mailing Lists
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!mailing lists</nidx>
These are low noise channels mainly for developers. Think
twice before asking questions there as noise delays the development.
Some relevant lists are <tt/linux-raid/, <tt/linux-scsi/ and <tt/linux-ext2fs/.
Many of the most useful mailing lists run on the <tt>vger.rutgers.edu</tt> server
but this is notoriously overloaded, so try to find a mirror. There are some lists mirrored at
<url url="http://www.redhat.com"
    name="The Redhat Home Page">.
Many lists are also accessible at
<url url="http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists"
    name="linuxhq">,
and the rest of the web site is a gold mine of useful information.

If you want to find out more about the lists available you can send a message
with the line <tt/lists/ to the list server at vger.rutgers.edu (
<htmlurl url="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu"
        name="majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">).
If you need help on how to use the mail server just send the line <tt/help/
to the same address.
Due to the popularity of this server it is likely it takes a bit to time before
you get a reply or even get messages after you send a <tt/subscribe/ command.

There is also a number of other majordomo list servers that can be of interest
such as the EATA driver list (
<htmlurl url="mailto:linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de"
        name="linux-eata@mail.uni-mainz.de">)
and the Intelligent IO list
<htmlurl url="mailto:linux-i2o@dpt.com"
        name="linux-i2o@dpt.com">.

Mailing lists are in a state of flux but you can find links to a number of
interesting lists from the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="Linux Documentation Homepage">.


<sect1>HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!HOWTOs</nidx>
These are intended as the primary starting points to
get the background information as well as show you how to solve
a specific problem.
Some relevant HOWTOs are <tt/Bootdisk/, <tt/Installation/,  <tt/SCSI/ and <tt/UMSDOS/.
The main site for these is the
<url url="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/"
    name="LDP archive">
at Metalab (formerly known as Sunsite).

There is a a new HOWTO out that deals with setting up a
DPT RAID system, check out the
<url url="http://www.ram.org/computing/linux/dpt&lowbar;raid.html"
    name="DPT RAID HOWTO homepage">.



<sect1>Mini-HOWTO
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!mini-HOWTOs</nidx>
These are the smaller free text relatives to the HOWTOs.
Some relevant mini-HOWTOs are
<tt/Backup-With-MSDOS/, <tt/Diskless/, <tt/LILO/, <tt/Large Disk/,
<tt/Linux+DOS+Win95+OS2/, <tt/Linux+OS2+DOS/, <tt/Linux+Win95/,
<tt/NFS-Root/, <tt/Win95+Win+Linux/, <tt/ZIP Drive/ .
You can find these at the same place as the HOWTOs, usually in a sub directory
called <tt/mini/. Note that these are scheduled to be converted into SGML and
become proper HOWTOs in the near future.

The old <tt/Linux Large IDE mini-HOWTO/ is no longer valid, instead read
<tt>/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/README.ide</tt> or
<tt>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/ide.txt</tt>.

<sect1>Local Resources
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!local</nidx>
In most distributions of Linux there is a document directory installed,
have a look in the
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc"
    name="/usr/doc"> directory.
where most packages store their main documentation and README files etc.
Also you will here find the HOWTO archive (
<htmlurl url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO">)
of ready formatted HOWTOs
and also the mini-HOWTO archive (
<url url="file:///usr/doc/HOWTO/mini"
    name="/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini">)
of plain text documents.

Many of the configuration files mentioned earlier can be found in the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc"
    name="/etc">
directory. In particular you will want to work with the
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/fstab"
    name="/etc/fstab">
file that sets up the mounting of partitions
and possibly also
<htmlurl url="file:///etc/mdtab"
    name="/etc/mdtab">
file that is used for the <tt/md/ system to set up RAID.

The kernel source in
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux"
    name="/usr/src/linux">
is, of course, the ultimate documentation. In other
words, <em>use the source, Luke</em>.
It should also be pointed out that the kernel comes not only with
source code which is even commented (well, partially at least)
but also an informative
<url url="file:///usr/src/linux/Documentation"
    name="documentation directory">.
If you are about to ask any questions about the kernel you should
read this first, it will save you and many others a lot of time
and possibly embarrassment.

Also have a look in your system log file (
<htmlurl url="file:///var/log/messages"
    name="/var/log/messages">)
to see what is going on and in particular how the booting went if
too much scrolled off your screen. Using <tt>tail -f /var/log/messages</tt>
in a separate window or screen will give you a continuous update of what is
going on in your system.

You can also take advantage of the 
<htmlurl url="file:///proc"
    name="/proc">
file system that is a window into the inner workings of your system.
Use <tt/cat/ rather than <tt/more/ to view the files as they are 
reported as being zero length. Reports are that <tt/less/ works well here.


<sect1>Web Pages
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!WWW</nidx>
<nidx>(your index root)!information resources!web pages</nidx>
There is a huge number of informative web pages out there and by their very
nature they change quickly so don't be too surprised if these links become
quickly outdated.

A good starting point is of course the
<url url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
    name="Linux Documentation Project"> home page,
an information central for documentation, project pages and much, much more.

Please let me know if you have any other leads that can be of interest.


<sect>Getting Help
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!assistance, obtaining</nidx>
<em>Your reader might still end up in a situation where extra help is
needed from someone else, perhaps on the net. In order to get fast and
efficient help it is best first to get some details on your system.
What details matter depends on type of problem. For disk problems you 
need to know the disk controllers etc, for networking problems you
have to know what ethernet card is used and version of drivers etc.
Here is the place to suggest what details to have ready when asking
for help.</em>

In the end you might find yourself unable to solve your problems and need
help from someone else. The most efficient way is either to ask someone
local or in your nearest Linux user group, search the web for the nearest
one.

Another possibility is to ask on Usenet News in one of the many, many
newsgroups available. The problem is that these have such a high
volume and noise (called low signal-to-noise ratio) that your question
can easily fall through unanswered.

No matter where you ask it is important to ask well or you will not be
taken seriously. Saying just <it/my disk does not work/ is not going
to help you and instead the noise level is increased even further and if
you are lucky someone will ask you to clarify.

Instead describe your problems in some detail that
will enable people to help you. The problem could lie somewhere you did
not expect. Therefore you are advised to list up the following information
on your system:

<descrip>
<tag/Hardware/
<itemize>
<item>Processor
<item>DMA
<item>IRQ
<item>Chip set (LX, BX etc)
<item>Bus (ISA, VESA, PCI etc)
<item>Expansion cards used (Disk controllers, video, IO etc)
</itemize>

<tag/Software/
<itemize>
<item>BIOS (On motherboard and possibly SCSI host adapters)
<item>LILO, if used
<item>Linux kernel version as well as possible modifications and patches
<item>Kernel parameters, if any
<item>Software that shows the error (with version number or date)
</itemize>

<tag/Peripherals/
<itemize>
<item>Type of disk drives with manufacturer name, version and type
<item>Other relevant peripherals connected to the same busses
</itemize>

</descrip>

Remember that booting text is logged to <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> which can
answer most of the questions above. Obviously if the drives fail you might not
be able to get  the log saved to disk but you can at least scroll back up the
screen using the <tt/SHIFT/ and <tt/PAGE UP/ keys. It may also be useful to
include part of this in your request for help but do not go overboard, keep
it <em/brief/ as a complete log file dumped to Usenet News is more than a
little annoying.


<sect>Concluding Remarks
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!conclusion</nidx>
<em>Just summing up... Also a place for general recommendations.</em>


<sect>Questions and Answers
<p>
<nidx>(your index root)!FAQ</nidx>
<nidx>(your index root)!frequently asked questions</nidx>
<em>Check the newsgroups and try to determine some frequent
problems and cover them here. Again an example from my HOWTO.</em>

This is just a collection of what I believe are the most common
questions people might have. Give me more feedback and I will
turn this section into a proper FAQ.

<itemize>

<item>Q:How many physical disk drives (spindles) does a Linux system need?
<p>
A: Linux can run just fine on one drive (spindle).  Having enough 
RAM (around 32 MB, and up to 64 MB) to support swapping is a 
better price/performance choice than getting a second disk.
(E)IDE disk is usually cheaper (but a little slower) than SCSI.

<item>Q: Are there any disadvantages in this scheme?
<p>
A: There is only a minor snag: if even a single partition overflows
the system might stop working properly. The severity depends of course
on what partition is affected. Still this is not hard to monitor, the
command <tt/df/ gives you a good overview of the situation. Also check
the swap partition(s) using <tt/free/ to make sure you are not about
to run out of virtual memory.

<item>Q: OK, so should I split the system into as many partitions
as possible for a single drive?
<p>
A: No, there are several disadvantages to that. First of all maintenance
becomes needlessly complex and you gain very little in this. In fact if your
partitions are too big you will seek across larger areas than needed.
This is a balance and dependent on the number of physical drives you have.

<sect>Converting the SGML File
<p>
Having made the SGML file we are now ready to convert it to
the various output formats we need. The following is my
script to process my Multi Disk HOWTO:

<code>
sgml2txt -f disk.sgml
sgml2html disk.sgml

sgml2latex --papersize=a4 --language=english  --output=ps ~stein/doc/disk.sgml
mv disk.ps disk-A4.ps
gzip -9 disk-A4.ps

sgml2latex --papersize=letter --language=english  --output=ps ~stein/doc/disk.sgml
mv disk.ps disk-US.ps
gzip -9 disk-US.ps

</code>

The template can be converted as is, substitute "disk.sgml" with
the filename of this template to see what it looks like.

If your document is small (such as this template)
you might find it more convenient to
keep formatted versions in one single file
rather than splitting it for every chapter:

<code>
sgml2html --split=0 template.sgml
</code>

		GNU Free Documentation License
		   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
