<EM>My comments to the reader is in this style (emphasized)</EM>.
Example lines are in plain roman style.
<EM>Note that extra comments and advice is found in comments
within the SGML source.</EM> 
<P>For various reasons this brand new release is codenamed
the <B>unleash</B> release.
<P>New code names will appear as per industry standard guidelines
to emphasize the state-of-the-art-ness of this document.
<P>
<P><EM>This Template is a suggestion and a starting point, a check list
for minimum features and also examples for authors.
Over time HOWTOs will outgrow any template since
in the end the goal is to inform readers efficiently.</EM>
<P>Stating the background is a simple way to getting started
writing the intro.
<P><EM>This is where you make a summary of what it news. When a HOWTO exceeds
20 pages it takes more than a casual read to find the updates. This is
where you help your readers with that, alerting them to specific and
important news.</EM>
<P>This is the first update featuring an improved structure.
<P><EM>Tell people where the document home page is so the very newest
release could be found in case of problems with the main
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A>
homepage.</EM>

<P>First of all we need a bit of legalese. Recent development shows it is
quite important.
