<EM>Check the newsgroups and try to determine some frequent
problems and cover them here. Again an example from my HOWTO.</EM>
<P>This is just a collection of what I believe are the most common
questions people might have. Give me more feedback and I will
turn this section into a proper FAQ.

<LI>Q:How many physical disk drives (spindles) does a Linux system need?
<P>A: Linux can run just fine on one drive (spindle).  Having enough 
RAM (around 32 MB, and up to 64 MB) to support swapping is a 
better price/performance choice than getting a second disk.
(E)IDE disk is usually cheaper (but a little slower) than SCSI.

<LI>Q: Are there any disadvantages in this scheme?
<P>A: There is only a minor snag: if even a single partition overflows
the system might stop working properly. The severity depends of course
on what partition is affected. Still this is not hard to monitor, the
command <CODE>df</CODE> gives you a good overview of the situation. Also check
the swap partition(s) using <CODE>free</CODE> to make sure you are not about
to run out of virtual memory.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Q: OK, so should I split the system into as many partitions
as possible for a single drive?
<P>A: No, there are several disadvantages to that. First of all maintenance
becomes needlessly complex and you gain very little in this. In fact if your
partitions are too big you will seek across larger areas than needed.
This is a balance and dependent on the number of physical drives you have.
