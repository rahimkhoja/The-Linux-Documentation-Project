       <B> Consultants Page </B>  

       LF does not charge any fees for access to the articles in its
       totality. Therefore we do not have funds to pay authors and
       translators for their work. Nevertheless we feel we owe many
       people something for their great efforts putting this magazine
       in motion. Beginning September 1998 LF wants to create a
       "Consultants Page", every author and collaborator of the
       magazine will have a short paragraph of space to advertise
       their skills, email & web pages.  We expect this new service
       will not only be a good way to compensate our collaborators but
       also a good asset of information for the linux community.

       <B>What is Linux<FONT color="#ff0000">Focus</FONT>?</B> 

       We are a group of Linux enthusiasts from all over the world,
       our goal is to make the best magazine online about Linux
       without ignoring the plurality of the Linux community.  We
       write all our articles in multiple languages thus helping to
       bring in new and younger people to the marvelous world of Linux
       and UNIX. Contrary to what we have read on the web, our
       magazine cannot be really described as a collection of "tips &
       tricks". As our name indicates we aim to provide in-depth
       information, we have a series of articles on specific topics
       and as users move along the series they can make the transition
       from novice to advanced users.

       </P>

       <P>
       <B>How many languages does Linux<FONT color="#ff0000">Focus</FONT>
                speak?</B>

	It is hard to tell because from month to month our staff
	continues to grow.  There are 4 well-developed and strong
	teams already: English, French, German and Spanish. There are
	also smaller groups with fluctuating number of people working
	on other versions: Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch. We
	would like to see these groups to become stronger and more
	stable. Our doors are always open to new people, if you want
	to be part of LF contact the appropriate editor in "<A
	href="../aboutus.html">About LF</A>" and write to us. We are
	always happy to see new faces.

        <P>Everyone in the LinuxFocus proyect wish you a Merry Christmas
	and Happy New Year. We hope you will not be surprised not to see
	any articles in the December 1998 issue. This month we have decided
	not to publish any articles due to the holidays and our lack of 
	members to write a December issue. Although we have dozens of 
	collaborators in the Spanish, French and other groups, unfortunately
	there are only two people in the English group and this makes
	it very difficult to translate in time articles. The good news is 
	that we have numerous articles in our archive not yet published. 
	As soon as we have time to translate and review them we will 
	make them available.</P>

	<P>There are mailing lists setup for those interested on
	participating in our various projects. The ones most urgently
	in need of help are the English and German groups. The German
	group needs new leadership and the English group seeks
	members to maintain webpages, translate and review articles.</P>
