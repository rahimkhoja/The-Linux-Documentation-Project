<br>
Welcome to the March 2000 issue of LinuxFocus! <br>The world around Linux
catches more and more the interest of big companies and in general
people who would like to make big business. 
We were also tempted to
get some income through advertisements but it's now decided that
LinuxFocus will stay as it is. We will not show blinking banner
advertisements. It should be your magazine and it should also be 
an independent magazine. After almost 3 years LinuxFocus is still the only 
free multi lingual magazine around Linux and we plan to keep our
multi lingual concept. <br>
<br>
While reading through the magazine you will notice that a few 
things have changed:
<Ul>
<li>Since mid January every new article has in the content
index on the left side an entry called &quot;Talkback form for this article&quot;. By clicking on this entry you can now submit comments or look at comments from other readers. <br>
<br>
<Li>Yes, LinuxFocus has a new logo. The new logo shows Tux, the Linux penguin,
riding on the LF-dolphin. We have also a small button which you can use to
link to LinuxFocus. To do that insert the following code in your web page:
<pre>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxfocus.org&quot;&gt;
&lt;IMG src=&quot;http://www.linuxfocus.org/common/images/lflogo_sbutton.gif&quot; 
alt=&quot;LinuxFocus&quot; width=&quot;143&quot; height=&quot;45&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

</pre>
This will then look as follows:<br>
<a href="http://www.linuxfocus.org"><IMG src="../../common/images/lflogo_sbutton.gif" alt="LinuxFocus" width="143" height="45"></a>
<br>
<br>
</li>

<a name="tip"> </a>

<li>LinuxFocus has a new <a href="../../common/sart/index.html">section</a> called
&quot;short articles and tips&quot;. This is a section where
everybody can contribute useful tips for Linux directly online. It does
not have to be anything complex. It can be as simple and useful as this:<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#555555">&quot;
What was the file that I viewed (not edited) last in this directory? 
<br>Solution: run the command ls -ut | head&quot;<br>
"What was the file that I edited last in this directory? 
<br>Solution: run the command ls -t | head&quot;</font>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../common/sart/index.html">read currently available short articles and tips</a>
<li><a href="http://cgi.linuxfocus.org/cgi-bin/artsubmit?do=subform">Submit a useful tip</a>
</ul>
