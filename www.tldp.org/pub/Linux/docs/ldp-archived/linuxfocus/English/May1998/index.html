                  objects which can be quite detailed, with complex
                  geometry and textures.

                        <p>Many new and exciting things have
                        happened since our last issue (March 1998).
                        Thanks to the help of many volunteers and
                        the generous sponsorship of two Spanish
                        ISPs (<a href="http://www.nova.es">Nova</a>

                        we have our own domain <a href=
                        "http://www.linuxfocus.org">linuxfocus.org</a>,
                        two servers (www.linuxfocus.org,
                        www.es.linuxfocus.org), accounts and free
                        access to the internet. We cannot thank
                        enough all of the people that have made our
                        magazine come to life. Many new groups from
                        all over the world are expressing interest
                        in being part of the Linux<font color=

                        the enthusiastic Danish, German and Turkish
                        groups to our editorial board. French
                        readers can already read nearly 80% of the
                        previous issues in their native language.
                        Our newcomers are working hard to catch up
                        with the oldest groups and we hope that, in
                        near future, all groups will be working at
                        the same pace.</p>

                        proudly announces that we are accepting
                        articles not only in English and Spanish
                        but also in German, French, Turkish and any
                        other language we support. This month's
                        articles were originally written in
                        different languages. This means that there
                        was a lot of translation work done so that
                        they could be read by all. We strive to
                        improve the quality of our translations in
                        every issue, but please understand that we
                        are all volunteers and novices in the
                        magazine business and are learning as we
                        go. You can help by sending us corrections,
                        or by offering to help with the translation
                        or revision of articles. All help is
                        welcome.</p>

                        <p>With each LF release, we realize more
                        and more just how much information is
                        available on the web. Many web sites bring
                        you the latest news flashes and rumors. It
                        appears that there is too much superficial
                        and dispersed information on the net,
                        requiring inquisitive readers to bounce all
                        over the web just to find the scraps of
                        information they need. Our philosophy is to
                        provide in-depth information all in one
                        place, on issues that interest novices and
                        new users alike. Recently, we have been
                        focusing on graphics and graphics
                        programming. But we are slowly exploring
                        other areas. This month, we have two new
                        exciting series: Real-Time Linux (an OS
                        series) and SQL programming (database).
                        There are also interesting initiatives
                        going on in the Spanish mailing lists. We
                        are experimenting with the idea of having
                        an ongoing course on the C programming
                        language that will bring together
                        professional C programmers, students and
                        curious young people. With this initiative,
                        we hope to take advantage of the internet
                        in an original way, and place an even
                        greater emphasis on in-depth education by
                        bringing together teachers and students.
                        This project is still in its infancy, but
                        we hope to offer this and other similar
                        initiatives in the future.</p>

              For about 2 years now there is a project going on
              called MindsEye. This project aims to create a
              Modeling/Rendering/Animation package for Linux/Unix
              that is equivalent with the big programs like 3D
              Studio Max or LightWave. So far, the development has
              been going very well after a rough start. Some of the
              implementation designs and engineering is rather
              unique for modeling programs.<br>

              Who has not heard of Pixar? Who has not seen "Toy

              specify what has to be rendered but not exactly what
              algorithm to use, so that modeling is independent of
              rendering. Learn more about this fantastic tool.<br>

              and matrix projection operations.<br>

              This article is the first of a three-part SQL
              tutorial intended for novice database developers. The

              The graphics corner continues to review and compare
              two good Image manipulation tools: Photoshop and
              Gimp. This month our reviewers explore the creation
              of text banners. Some of the techniques commonly used
              for making special effects with text apply to both
              utilities. Interestingly, the excellent text-handling
              capabilities of the Gimp are at a similar level as
              Adobe Photoshop, a commercial product.<br>
