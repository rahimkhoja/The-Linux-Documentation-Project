And here it is again....Another issue of the first free multi-lingual
web magazine for and by Linux users. Our front cover for July shows 
LF mascot on its way to the Bay Area, with this we symbolize the closure
of a chapter in the history of the magazine and the beginning of a new
phase. LinuxFocus home base is moving from Pittsburgh to the Bay Area,
this will be an exciting change given the number and strength of Linux
users in Silicon Valley. LF will do its best to bring you inside stories
and interviews from such an enthusiastic community.

This new volume of our magazine brings you a mix of interesting articles ranging
from graphics to  system security. We thank all authors sharing with us their
knowledge and work, but this month we would like to acknowledge in particular the
students and staff of the Computer Science Department at the
<I>Polytechnic University of Valencia</I> (UPV) for so many articles, translations, and support.

<B>New Linux Products and Services. </B> <BR> 

<P><i>CrossWind Technologies</i> has recently released (June 23 , 1998)
<A href="http://www.crosswind.com">
CyberScheduler 2.1</A> for Linux a web-based calendaring and scheduling tool for
workgroups. It runs on Apache web server and supports any desktop browser.
At the moment it supports both RPM and TAR installations.
</P>

<P>There is a new Linux Chat room accesible from the web, it is 
available for discussions of linux topics, questions, online HOWTOs, etc.
It's name is <I>Linux-Chat</I> and it can be accessed either via
 telnet (linux.intergrafix.net 5000)
or <A href="http://www.intergrafix.net/linux/java"> java applet</A>.</P>


<P><B>Consultants Page </B>  
LF does not charge any fees for access to the articles in its
totality. Therefore we do not have funds to pay authors and
translators for their work. Nevertheless we feel we owe many
people something for their great efforts putting this magazine
in motion. Beginning September 1998 LF wants to create a "Consultants
Page", every author and collaborator of the magazine will have a short
paragraph of space to advertise their skills, email & web pages.
We expect this new service will not only be a good way to compensate our
collaborators but also a good asset of information for the linux community.</P>

<P><B>What is Linux<FONT color="#ff0000">Focus</FONT>?</B> We are a group
of Linux enthusiasts from all over the world, our goal is to make the best
magazine online about Linux without ignoring the plurality of the Linux community.
We write all our articles in multiple languages thus helping to bring in 
new and younger people to the marvelous world of Linux and UNIX. Contrary to what 
we have read on the web, our magazine cannot be really described as a collection
of "tips & tricks". As our name indicates we aim to provide in-depth information, we
have a series of articles on specific topics and as users move along the series they
can make the transition from novice to advanced users.
</P>

<P><B>How many languages does Linux<FONT color="#ff0000">Focus</FONT> speak?</B>
It is hard to tell because from month to month our staff continues to grow.
There are 4 well-developed and strong teams already: English, French,
German and Spanish. There are also smaller groups with fluctuating number
of people working on other versions: Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch. We would like
to see these groups to become stronger and more stable. Our doors are always
open to new people, if you want to be part of LF contact the appropriate editor
in  "<A href="../aboutus.html">About LF</A>" and write to us. We are always happy 
to see new faces.
