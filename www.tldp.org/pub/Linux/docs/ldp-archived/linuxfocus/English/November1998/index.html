          <p><b>Consultants Page</b> LF does not charge any fees
          for access to the articles in its totality. Therefore we
          do not have funds to pay authors and translators for
          their work. Nevertheless we feel we owe many people
          something for their great efforts putting this magazine
          in motion. Beginning September 1998 LF wants to create a
          "Consultants Page", every author and collaborator of the
          magazine will have a short paragraph of space to
          advertise their skills, email &amp; web pages. We expect
          this new service will not only be a good way to
          compensate our collaborators but also a good asset of
          information for the linux community.</p>

          <p><b>What is Linux<font color=
          "#ff0000">Focus</font>?</b> We are a group of Linux
          enthusiasts from all over the world, our goal is to make
          the best magazine online about Linux without ignoring the
          plurality of the Linux community. We write all our
          articles in multiple languages thus helping to bring in
          new and younger people to the marvelous world of Linux
          and UNIX. Contrary to what we have read on the web, our
          magazine cannot be really described as a collection of
          "tips &amp; tricks". As our name indicates we aim to
          provide in-depth information, we have a series of
          articles on specific topics and as users move along the
          series they can make the transition from novice to
          advanced users.</p>

          <p><b>How many languages does Linux<font color=
          "#ff0000">Focus</font> speak?</b> It is hard to tell
          because from month to month our staff continues to grow.
          There are 4 well-developed and strong teams already:
          English, French, German and Spanish. There are also
          smaller groups with fluctuating number of people working
          on other versions: Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch.
          We would like to see these groups to become stronger and
          more stable. Our doors are always open to new people, if
          you want to be part of LF contact the appropriate editor
          in "<a href="../aboutus.html">About LF</a>" and write to
          us. We are always happy to see new faces.</p>

             This text tells the story of installing a recent
            release of GNU/Linux operating system from scratch on a
            laptop computer. It is intended as a source of
            information for people who want to install Linux on a
            similar laptop or even on a desktop machine, and
            perhaps is also of interest for developers of Linux
            distributions. The exposition is quite technical, so
            readers should be reasonably familiar with (or
            sufficiently interested in learning about) the Unix
            operating system.</li>

             Are you looking for a simple graphics package for your
            Linux system? If so, look no further. SVGAlib provides
            an easy way to create graphical applications and
            eliminates the rigmarole of the X Window System. If you
            have even the most rudimentary grasp of programming in
            C, then you can use SVGAlib.</li>
