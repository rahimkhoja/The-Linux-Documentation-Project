<h1>LinuxFocus November 2000 issue</h1>

<img align=left src="../../common/images/coverNovember2000.gif" width=300
height=300>

<p>This nice warm October month has been subject to an unusually high
concentration of Linux conferences -- all at the same time.
It started with the <a href="http://www.LinuxWorldExpo.de">www.LinuxWorldExpo.de</a> in Frankfurt, Germany, from October
5th to October 7th. Linus was there but he did not give any key note speech.
Next was <a href="http://www.linux2000.nl">www.linux2000.nl</a> in Ede, the Netherlands (9/10th of October). Here the key note speech was given by Eric Raymond.
The last one in the row was the
Atlanta Linux Showcase &amp; Conference,  
<a href="http://www.linuxshowcase.org">www.linuxshowcase.org</a> October 10-14, 2000. Shortly before these three was the
<a href="http://www.linuxtag.de/">linuxtag.de</a>, at the beginning of July.
<br>Each of them attracted quite high number of visitors. 
LinuxFocus was at the linux2000.nl, probably the smallest of these
3 October events. I made some photos which
you can find &gt;<a href="http://main.linuxfocus.org/~guido/dev/Linux2000.nl/pictures/">here</a>&lt;. It was the first time that I saw Eric Raymond.
His speeches are really good. If you have a chance to hear him somewhere ...
I can recommend it. What I really love about these events is not so much
the big business that you can find on every commercial fare, but rather
the passion and enthusiasm of all the Linux fans coming to these
events. The news papers concentrate these days a lot on the
&quot;drama and conflict&quot; between Windows and Linux, but dramatic stories
are just an old recipe for writing articles in the papers. Linux is
not just another operating system. It is much more. It's a whole
community of fans and users. I hope that we are able preserve this
enthusiastic spirit and the community.

<h4> <font color="#660033"> The LinuxFocus Tip</font></h4>

<p>Where was this web page? Hmmmm, I had a link to it
in my Netscape bookmarks ..... but I have 250 book marks.
... It was something like &quot;focus&quot; and had to do with Linux....
<br><b> Has this ever happened to you?</b>
Here comes a little perl script called <a href="../../common/src/showbook.txt">showbook</a>.
<br>Save it as showbook and type 
chmod 755 showbook to make it executable.

<pre>showbook focus
</pre> 
Would e.g list all bookmarks that have either the string 
&quot;focus&quot; in the url or 
in the description of the bookmark. The search is not
case sensitive.
<br><br>
<font size="-1">Note to those still surfing the web under windows: When you 
download the perl script showbook (a text file) under windows then it
might get an extra carriage return character added at the end of each line.
You have to remove this extra character before you can use the script.
The command dos2unix will e.g remove that extra carriage return.
