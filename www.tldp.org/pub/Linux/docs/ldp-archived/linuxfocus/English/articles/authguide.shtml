LinuxFocus exists only because many people are contributing to it. Share your experiences and knowledge! Write an article. It's very easy and it's fun.

<center><H1>Guidelines for Authors</h1></center>
<ul>
  <li>
    We recommend to edit your articles with a plain text editor.
    A WYSIWYG HTML editor may also do the job but produces
    usually &quot;ugly&quot; HTML files with lot of &amp;nbsp; and non standard tag attributes in it. If you have never written HTML pages then it
is a good opportunity to learn it now. Take a look at the <a href="simple.shtml">simple HTML guide</a>. Some basic HTML tags are sufficient to write the article.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>No matter how you edit your article your should use our
      template (<a href="new001.meta.shtml">new001.meta.shtml</a>).
      This is a simple HTML file with some structure in it. After the
      heading ArticleBody you can just write your article as you like.
      Save this template to disk and edit it.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    If the subject of the article favors it, we encourage the 
    inclusion of illustrations and figures in the body of the
    article. Authors are free to use diagrams to illustrate ideas,
    organize concepts or to motivate readers.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Every article in our magazine brings a picture of the author
    and a small personal biography. The biography can be a few paragraphs
    long and its goal its to give authors a chance to talk about
    their history, professional background, hobbies, relation to
    Linux, etc. This information should be included in the template 
    after the heading AboutTheAuthor. The picture of the author
    goes after AuthorImage.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Before writing a new article think a bit about the structure of 
    your article and the message that you would like to send to the
    reader. The best articles are understandable for new Linux users and
    and still interesting to people with experience.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    An article is a window to a given field of knowledge. Do not
    leave that door closed. Include references at the end of
    the article, both to Web publications (URLs) and to
    printed sources.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Experience shows that most readers prefer article which can be
    read in less than 20 minutes. If you have a much longer article
    then consider splitting it into 2 articles (e.g article1: introduction, installation
    small example, article2: more advanced features and examples).
    As a guideline: <b>1500 to 3500 words. Not more.</b> You can use
the UNIX command <code>wc -w</code> to count the words.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Articles can be submitted to the editor of your own
    language or directly to the editor-in-chief (currently this is
    <b>Guido Socher</b>
    ). The <a href="../../common/lfteam.html">lf-team</a> page has
    a list of contact persons with e-mail addresses.
    Preferably your article and the included images, code examples
    etc... should be packed together in a tar.gz archive.
    The command to do this under Linux is:<br>
    <tt>tar zcvf myart.tar.gz file1 file1 file3...</tt>
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
You must own the full copyright for your article. That is: it is original
and must not be the work of somebody else. If you publish information
about projects or software or anything that does not have an open
copyright license then you must have the permission to do so. Example:
you must not write about a new software developed in a secret project
at the CIA unless you have written permission to do so.
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    All our articles are published under the terms of 
    the creative commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License"
    (see <a href="../../common/copy.html">copy right page</a>). 
    By sending in an article to LinuxFocus for publication
    you certify that you agree to these terms.
<br><br>
  </li>
</ul> 

    <p>Happy editing and thanks for you time and creativity! 
    We look forward to receive your article.</P>
