<h1>Information for editors</h1>

<h2>Why do we use meta.shtml files?</h2>
The meta.shtml are very simple in structure and can easily be
edited. It is much easier to read for humans.
If we decide to changed the layout of the final articles then
we don't need to change our meta.shtml files we just change the
converted and re-run it.

<h2>Why .shtml and not .html?</h2>
The articles use server side includes (SSI). Some parts of the html
code that you see in your browser is generated at run time, the
moment you click on the article. The web server recognizes those
files that have SSI commands inside by the name .shtml.

<h2>Why can I not download an articleXXX.shtml file via my html browser and translate it?</h2>
Well, because you don't get the same file as it is on the disk of the
LinuxFocus server. The links to the other languages are e.g generated automatically and updated automatically. If you download the articleXXX.shtml file
today then the article may be available in let's say 3 languages and
the appropriate code is generated for these 3 languages. A week later
when you are ready with the translation this may not be valid any
longer. Now there might be articles available in 5 languages but your
translation will never update it self. It is frozen.

<h2>meta.shtml is also a .shtml file. Why can I download it via my html browser?</h2>
The meta.shtml do not contain SSI commands. These files could also be
called meta.html. We just named them meta.shtml to indicate that we
will convert it to a articleXXX.shtml file.

<h2>I don't have a working perl installation to run lfparser</h2>
Get it working! For the moment you can download the
articleXXX.shtml via ftp instead of http. Downloading them via
ftp will leave the SSI commands unchanged and they will still be
there after you have translated the article. This should however
really be the exception. The articleXXX.shtml file is much more
complicated and difficult to read. It is easy to mess it up. 
Try to use meta.shtml files for your translation work and then
convert them using lfparser.

<h2>Converting meta.shtml to the final article</h2>
<p>To convert a meta.shtml article to the final article you need
lfparser which you can get 
<a href="http://pepper.linuxfocus.org/~guido/dev/lfparser.html">from pepper.linuxfocus.org/~guido/dev/lfparser.html</a>. Run <tt>lfparser -h</tt> to get information on
how to use it.</p>

<h2>Is there any further doumenation for editors? </h2>
Yes, have a look at the files in
<a href="http://main.linuxfocus.org/doc/">main.linuxfocus.org/doc</a>,<br>
the Editor's guide:
<a href="editorsguide.html">editorsguide.html</a>.
