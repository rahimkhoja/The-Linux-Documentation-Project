This document briefly describes how to set up MMBase on a Debian Gnu/Linux (Woody) system 
while using as much default packages as possible.

<sect>Introduction<p>

<sect1>Homepage<p>

If you got this document from a Linux HOWTO mirror site or a CD-ROM,
you might want to check back to the <url name="MMBase Mini-HOWTO home
page" url="http://www.dnd.utwente.nl/~joost/mmbase-mini/MMBase-Mini-HOWTO.html"> to see if there's a
newer version around.<p>

This document only covers a very small portion of MMBase installation, for 
the official documentation visit <url name="MMBase home page" 
url="http://www.mmbase.org">.<p>

Finally, this is my first HOWTO, my first experience with linuxdoc and I am no expert on 
MMBase either. I am just trying to share my solutions to some problems I encountered while installing
MMBase on a Debian system.<p>

<sect1>History<p>

<sect1>Acknowledgements<p>
I would like to thank a number of people for helping me during my quest for a clean installation. 
Although I do not know their names, their nicknames on irc are: <em>keesj, jdg, flax, scb2</em>. 
I hope they forgive me for not trying to find out their real names.<p>
I would also like to thank my employer, the <em>University of Twente</em> for allowing me to write this
document during working hours.

<sect>What is MMBase?<p>
On their website, the authors say the following about it:<p>
<itemize> 
<item>MMBase is an opensource publishing system. MMBase can be used to create big websites that can be maintained easily.
<item>MMBase separates content from layout, in this way information can be reused easily.
<item>MMBase is very unique in the way it maintains its information. MMBase creates an object cloud that is a digital representation of the 'real' world objects that are of interest for you.<p>
</itemize><p>

In this document I will describe how to get MMBase running on a Debian Woody System, using
as many standard packages as possible. Though it is very easy to run MMBase using their 
automatic installation tools, you will end up with their version of a webserver, servlet engine 
and database.<p>
After a few days of playing with my own install, I think I can help others by describing 
which choices I made to get things running. I do not claim this is the only way, or the best way! 
But it worked for me :)<p>

The version of MMBase used is 1.5. Ofcourse everything might be different with another version.<p>

MMbase can run together with various webservers, databases, servlet engines and JRE's.
The programs/packages/versions I chose are:<p>
<itemize>
<item>MySQL-Server (3.23.49-8) 
<item>Tomcat4 (4.0.3-3) 
<item>j2sdk1.3 (1.3.1-1) (Java) 
<item>imagemagick (4:5.4.4.5-1)
</itemize><p>

Attention: The version numbers are those that were available in
the Woody distribution at the time of writing. Except for Java, which
came from a different location. See <ref id="java" name="Non standard package(s)">.
<p>

Some other options for databases and webservers are described in the
installation notes for MMBase 1.5
<p>

<sect>Prerequisites<p>

You will need a working Debian Woody installation, including apt, and make sure 
the following packages are installed and working correctly.

<sect1>Standard packages<p>
<itemize>
<item>tomcat4
<item>mysql-server
<item>imagemagick
</itemize><p>

If these packages are not installed, you can do so by typing
<tscreen><verb>
  apt-get install packagename 
</verb></tscreen>
where packagename is one of the above.<p>

Note: naturally you will need al dependencies too, but apt will take care of that
automatically.

<sect1>Non standard package(s)<label id="java"><p>
While writing this document, Woody only contains java 1.1, but for MMBase
version 1.2 or higher is needed. I installed the packages from Blackdown. 
A list of Blackdown mirrors is at <url name="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html"
 url="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html">.<p>

I added the following to my /etc/apt/sources.list , but the path might be different for different mirrors:
<tscreen><verb>
  deb ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/os/Linux/java/jdk/debian woody non-free 
</verb></tscreen><p>

After that you can just type
<tscreen><verb>
  apt-get install j2sdk1.3  
</verb></tscreen><p>

Note: Although it must be possible to have more JRE's installed next to eachother, I wouldn't recommend
it if it's not absolutely neccesary.

<sect>Getting MMBase and setting up some things<p>
<sect1>Getting MMBase<p>
Now that you have all supporting packages up and running (you <em>did</em> 
follow the instructions in the previous section, didn't you?) get yourself a copy of MMBase. 
As said before, this document describes the works for MMbase version 1.4.<p>

Download MMBase from <url name="http://www.mmbase.org/releases/mmbase-1.5.zip"
url="http://www.mmbase.org/releases/mmbase-1.5.zip"> with a browser, or even easier:
<tscreen><verb>
  wget http://www.mmbase.org/releases/mmbase-1.5.zip  
</verb></tscreen><p>

From version 1.5 MMBase can be used as an webapp within Tomcat. So I
recommend unpacking the distribution in a temporary directory and copying
the mmbase-webapp/ tree to /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/.
If MMBase is your only (or main) application on Tomcat, you can also install
it as ROOT, by copying everything from mmbase-webapp/ to /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/ROOT/. 

In this document I will assume that MMBase is unpacked in
/var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/mmbase-webapp/<p>


<sect1>Getting mm.mysql<p>

You will also need mysql.jar (JDBC driver for MySQL) which can be downloaded from 
<url name="http://mmmysql.sourceforge.net/" url="http://mmmysql.sourceforge.net/">. <newline>
Make sure you get the binary jar, which means you may have to unjar the
complete distribution first and locate the file mm.mysql-2.0.14-bin.jar
(2.0.14 was the latest release when writing this HOWTO)
Put the file in /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/lib/.<p>


<sect1>Creating a database for MMBase<p>
MMbase needs a database and a user that has full rights on that database.
The user seems to needs rights via localhost and the real hostname. 
This was not entirely clear to me.<p>

Issue the following commands on the MySQL prompt. I chose a database called MMBase, a user named mmbaseuser and 
the password secret.<p>
<tscreen><verb>
CREATE DATABASE MMBase
USE MMBase
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP ON MMBase.* TO mmbaseuser@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP ON MMBase.* TO mmbaseuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'
GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP ON MMBase.* TO mmbaseuser@realhostname IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'
flush privileges;
</verb></tscreen><p>

<sect1>Tomcat security manager<p>
The Tomcat java security manager somehow interferes with MMBase. I haven't
found out what settings are needed to run MMBase with the security manager
active. Please let me know. For now I disabled the security manager, which
you should never not do. (Big Disclaimer!)

In /etc/default/tomcat4 change the security line to:<newline>
TOMCAT4_SECURITY="no"

<sect1>Copying xml-apis<p>
For some odd reason, Tomcat wants to find the file WEB-INF/lib/xml-apis.jar also in
/usr/share/tomcat/common/lib/xml-apis.jar, so you have to copy it.<p>

<sect>Configuration files<p>
There are various configuration files that need some adjustment or have to be created.

<sect1>apache<p>
In my setup, I created a virtual host to handle all MMBase request, but using a few <em>Alias</em> directors
it cannot be too hard to include MMBase somewhere in your normal web tree.<p>

That was for my last setup (HOWTO version 0.1 covering MMBase 1.4).

Using the newest version of Tomcat and Apache, I have troubles getting the
two working together. As soon as I find out how to use libapache-mod-webapp
or libapache-mod-jk with tomcat4, I will update this HOWTO.<p>

One posible solution is compiling mod-webapp yourself, because the version
that comes with Debian seems to be non-standard. This is beyond the scope and intention of this
HOWTO.<p>

This also means that by default MMBase will run on port 8180 (directly from
the stand-alone Tomcat server. You can change this port in
/etc/tomcat4/server.xml

<sect1>MMBase<p>
Although many things have to be configured on MMBase itself, I have added a few subjects to this mini-HOWTO.<p>
The database access should be set in WEB-INF/config/modules/jdbc.xml :<p> 

<tscreen><verb>
	<property name="url">jdbc:mysql://$HOST:$PORT/$DBM?user=mmbaseuser&amp;password=secret&etago;/property>
	<property name="user">url&etago;/property>
	<property name="password">url&etago;/property>
	<property name="database">MMBase&etago;/property>
 	<property name="driver">org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver&etago;/property>
</verb></tscreen><p>

And one more line to change to get the mysql connection working. In WEB-INF/config/modules/mmbaseroot.xml
make sure you have this setting:

<tscreen><verb>
	<property name="database">mysql&etago;/property>
</verb></tscreen><p>


The builder for images contains a path to convert that is not Debian-compliant. Change 
WEB-INF/config/builders/images.xml

<tscreen><verb>
	<properties>
        	<property name="ImageConvert.ConverterCommand">bin/convert&etago;property>
        	<property name="ImageConvert.ConverterRoot">/usr/&etago;property>
        	<property name="ImageConvertClass">org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertImageMagick&etago;property>
	&etago;properties>
</verb></tscreen><p>


<sect>Getting more help<p>
There are various sources for more help on most of the subject covered in this mini-HOWTO. All packages have
their own documentation. Some links that really helped me are:<p>
<itemize>
<item>Apache: <url name="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/" url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/"> 
<item>Tomcat: <url name="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.0-doc/index.html" url="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.0-doc/index.html">
<item>MMBase: Click on Documentation on <url name="http://www.mmbase.org/" url="http://www.mmbase.org/">
<item>Java: <url name="http://java.sun.com/" url="http://java.sun.com/">
</itemize><p>

Another great source for help is channel #mmbase on ircnet, usually there are some developers there.
