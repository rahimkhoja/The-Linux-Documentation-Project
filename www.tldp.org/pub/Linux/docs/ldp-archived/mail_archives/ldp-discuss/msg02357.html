I'm all for this ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;J&quot; == Jon 'maddog' Hall, Executive Director, Linux International &lt;maddog@valinux.com&gt; writes:

    J&gt; Of course it takes time to develop and give a talk, but for
    J&gt; someone who knows the information and how to organize and
    J&gt; present it, it takes only a short time to do that effort.  

This could use some mentoring; I have been slowly edging myself into
this arena just because I love to talk about it and I seem to be
giving the same OSS evangelist spiel over and over to crowds of two or
three when I travel, and putting them all into one room at one time
just seems more efficient, and leaves more time to actually do real
work.  It's also why I took on some writing, speaking at small LUG
meetings and doing the RadioWallStreet shows.

My trouble is not having a lot of experience in this. I haven't been
in cubicle land for almost a decade and get to precious few shows (not
many happen in my rural wilderness) so I'm largely making it up as I
go. I keep hoping for feedback after I give a talk but people just say
&quot;oh it was great&quot; and leave it at that.  It's frustrating.  

Others may also have something to say but are similarly inexperienced
in the art of public speaking and I wonder if there is any way we can
&quot;grow&quot; more public speakers.

(when I grow up, I want to speak smooth and personal like Bob Young,
but I fear I just don't have the salesman gene that makes it happen ;)

As a total aside ...

    J&gt; He was loaned a laptop to allow him to show his slides, and he
    J&gt; bought nationwide Internet access so he could keep in touch.  

&lt;PLUG CLASS=&quot;SHAMELESS&quot;&gt; 
    Next time, go to my site and take out a free dialup account for
    them; we have ports in over 1200 cities across north america and
    the service is very friendly to Linux.  No ads, no spam, just a
    requirement to visit the portal page as your first stop.
&lt;/PLUG&gt;

An exchange program seems like an excellent idea.  Linux is a unique
opportunity to tear down walls between countries and I'd love to see
some of the members of the SNDP &quot;Public Software&quot; group (the successor
to Linux-without-borders) on the speaking tours.

    J&gt; What would be great would be a Linux Documentation Speaker's
    J&gt; Bureau, something along the lines of the one that SSC set up
    J&gt; under

    J&gt; <A  HREF="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/cgi-bin/frames.pl/lr-toc.html">http://www2.linuxjournal.com/cgi-bin/frames.pl/lr-toc.html</A>

The difficulty is evaluating the speakers -- we can list everyone but
it may have ill effects if we 'sell' a conference on a speaker who
turns out to be a total bore, clueless or worse, like me who keeps
forgetting where he is in his presentation (I need to perfect the art
of &quot;taking a moment&quot; ;).

I have a similar problem recruiting authors.  Anyone is welcome to
write for the LDP, and we take most anyone as a paid tech reviewer,
but for a commercial book, a writer, unless they are a celebrity,
needs to be good at it or they get disappointing royalties, and that
wastes the author's time.  

Looking at the LJ list, I can't imagine sifting through that to take
anyone except the cele
Maybe it is our common duty to keep a watch at conferences to spot
newcomers who are especially good at public speaking.  Those who know
me know I'm not a big fan of 'certifications' but maybe what we want
(and also my concept of tech certification) is to build a &quot;better
business bureau&quot; where those who have hired the speaker can rate them
non-anonymously so we can track reputations by previous references.
