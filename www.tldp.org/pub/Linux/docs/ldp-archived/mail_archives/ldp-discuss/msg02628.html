Hi Greg and others,

&gt; &gt; Perhaps I was not precise enough here. Give me another chance 
&gt; &gt; to explain it:
&gt; &gt; HOWTOs are about how to do something on Linux. It is possible 
&gt; &gt; (and, in some
&gt; &gt; cases, absolutely sure) that a certain task can be 
&gt; &gt; accomplished more quickly,
&gt; &gt; or more
&gt; &gt; easily, or more anything on a different OS, say Windows. 
&gt; &gt; However, a Linux
&gt; &gt; HOWTO
&gt; &gt; will only cover the topic on Linux. Windows users will not 
&gt; &gt; turn to a Linux
&gt; &gt; HOWTO if they have a problem.
&gt; &gt; The HOWTO-HOWTO is also a HOWTO, although a special one. It 
&gt; &gt; is not about
&gt; &gt; &quot;sharing the best information about&quot; writing in DocBook. It 
&gt; &gt; is Linux-oriented,
&gt; &gt; or,
&gt; &gt; if you like, Linux-biased.
&gt; &gt; This is what I meant by &quot;we are doing Linux here&quot;.
&gt; &gt; Is this provincialism?
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, a great deal of the HOWTOs are not Linux specific, they tell you
&gt; how to do something under linux.  For example, about 80% of the CD-Writing
&gt; HOWTO is NOT specific to linux.  The only pieces that are specific to linux
&gt; are the ones on how to compile the kernel.  Everything else works on any
&gt; Unix-like system.  If this HOWTO was to cover ONLY the linux portions,
&gt; nobody would be able to figure anything out from the HOWTO, as it would
lack
&gt; all of the general information.  

Do you really think that was what I meant?

&gt; The HOWTO-HOWTO is indeed a special HOWTO.  I do NOT believe it should be
&gt; about howto to write a HOWTO using linux tools, it should be about how to
&gt; write a HOWTO covering some Linux topic.  You tell them what tools are
&gt; available, and how those tools rank it terms of features and ease of use.

&gt; &gt; A practical note: I do not quite see how to write about a 
&gt; &gt; Linux theme while
&gt; &gt; using Windows. For me, it would involve rebooting the machine 
&gt; &gt; every ten
&gt; &gt; minutes
&gt; &gt; or so.
&gt; 
&gt; I can think of many occasions where this doesn't apply.  I've got 4
&gt; computers on or around my desk at home, one of them runs MS Windows,
&gt; sometimes.  If I was writing documentation about my S/linux machine, I
could
&gt; easily do that on the windows machine, while I was looking at the SPARC
next
&gt; to me.  As a second example, how about what Gary did?  Take an existing
&gt; HOWTO who's topic you're familiar with, and re-write it, or make changes.
&gt; You might not need to have access to your Linux machine to do that,
&gt; depending on how often you work with that topic, and how familiar you are
&gt; with it.  There are other scenarios, but I think those are enough.
&gt; [snip]
&gt; Please, stop with the Holy War.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Things will definitely change when we move to XML: we will 
&gt; &gt; have more tools.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;If wishes were horses, then beggars could ride.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Good to know.
&gt; &gt; What I meant was there are much more XML editors than SGML editors.
&gt; 
&gt; Really?  What about processing tools, and search engines?  There are more,
&gt; but they are largely untested with DocBook, since it's only been officially
&gt; XML for a couple of weeks.
&gt; 	Greg

I still think we will have more tools when we move to XML.
I did not state it would happen tomorrow.

To the point: I realize that I made a mistake in assuming that the
&quot;preferred&quot; OS of all LDP authors was Linux. Really, I do not know
why I thought that: it simply seemed obvious to me. Well, it does not
any more.

As to the &quot;Holy War&quot;: it surprises me that you label my posts as such.
I suppose you know why you do.

Cheers,
Pal
