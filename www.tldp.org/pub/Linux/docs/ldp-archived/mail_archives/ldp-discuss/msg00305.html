&gt; Hello to all,
&gt; 
&gt; Let me just preface this by saying that these are my views and comments
&gt; and mine alone, not those of the LDP.  I'm not asking for pity, nor a
&gt; shoulder to cry on.
&gt; 
&gt;                &lt;have a seat....this could be lengthy&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've sat back and watched once again as my name and the job I do get
&gt; dragged through the mud.  This time I can't and will not sit back and
&gt; watch this happen *again* and turn my back.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the complaints and removing of documents , all I can say is this,
&gt; I'm sorry for the problems that occured and I'm sorry that he felt that he
&gt; needed to be 1) rude and 2) disrespectful not only to me, but all others
&gt; subscribed to the list.  This is my personal opinion and not necessarily
&gt; those of others, so don't go blaming the LDP for the comments that I am
&gt; making.  These are *not* the views of the LDP, these are my own personal
&gt; views and comments.  Please don't confuse the two.
&gt; 
&gt; Many times I have asked how I was doing, I've asked for suggestions and
&gt; assistance.  Rarely if ever do I receive a comment one, but let one person
&gt; have a complaint (in a very imperfect world I might add) and the walls
&gt; just come crumbling down.
&gt; 
&gt; Like it or not, the LDP has progressed and I have assisted in this
&gt; process.  No one has once asked how the processing of HOWTOs actually
&gt; works or even cared enough to do so.  Some discussions did take place, and
&gt; I did try to explain, but I honestly don't think anyone was listening (I
&gt; feel this a lot).
&gt; 
&gt; I've asked for feedback from authors/maintainers and even made suggestions
&gt; that they get more involved.  This was over a year ago (probably close to
&gt; 2) and no one had time or no one cared to respond at any length.  I asked
&gt; if the authors/maintainers would like to assist in approving documents
&gt; submittals and I got 0% response.....that's right nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; I've created pages for updates and for current projects to allow others to
&gt; know what's going on and to hopefully get them involved.  Did this
&gt; accomplish anything?  Honestly I don't know b/c no one has ever bothered
&gt; to comment on them.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that the ldp-discuss list (and others) has become nothing short
&gt; of a means of pulic humiliation and I'm not just talking about myself.  
&gt; This is *not* what the list is for.  Public bickering back and forth has
&gt; no place on this list.  Sure, it may help you to get your point across,
&gt; but if that's all you want, then surely you could find a better means.
&gt; 
&gt; I've even publicly made available my pager via a paging server.  Do you
&gt; think I did this for kicks?  It was done to give anyone who wanted
&gt; *direct* access to me for whatever reason they had that ability.  I'm not
&gt; asking anyone to use it, but I did state that it was there to be used if
&gt; you needed it.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that a lot of time is spent by authors/maintainers updating
&gt; docs.  But do you think the rest of us have no other life outside the LDP?
&gt; We all (I assume) are responsible adults and I find it a crying shame that
&gt; more of us don't act like it when presented with a public forum.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not my nature to be a downer or have a negative attitude and I feel
&gt; that I've held my head high for good reason in regards to being the HOWTO
&gt; Coordinator.  I'm not perfect, nor is the job I do, but I do take pride in
&gt; it and that should account for something. ???
&gt; 
&gt; As for the missed/lost docs that have recently been brought to
&gt; ldp-discuss, again I have apologized...publicly.
&gt; 
&gt; There have been many new additions and many updates to the HOWTOs (I use
&gt; this generally I include mini-HOWTOs and FAQs) and to accuse me of
&gt; deliberately ignoring someone or deliberately setting their update aside
&gt; or basically just having better things to do with my time is unacceptable,
&gt; untrue and a complete disrespect to me and what I do.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past (whether there were complaints or not) I asked if others were
&gt; happy with what I was doing.  I've even asked if anyone would like me to
&gt; step down and look for someone else to take my place as the HOWTO
&gt; Cooridnator.  It was rather quiet, but the comments that were made
&gt; appreciated what I was doing and asked that I hang in there.  Where are
&gt; those folks now when push comes to shove?!?
&gt; 
&gt; When you believe in something strong enough you'll do what you can to
&gt; survive and keep it going.  This is how I felt (feel more often than not)
&gt; about the HOWTO Coordinator position and the LDP.
&gt; 
&gt; I must say this.....the way the move (if that's what you want to call it)
&gt; from Metalab (formerly Sunsite) was handled was inexcusable.  This I'm
&gt; afraid *is* a direct reflection on the LDP.  I do not blame Guylhem for
&gt; how things were handled nor should anyone else.  People did nothing but
&gt; complain about the way things were going and Guylhem asked for feedback
&gt; and as with me got little response and the majority of the responses were
&gt; not solutions but rather threads that turned into many lines of
&gt; nothingness, meaning that nothing was ever being resolved so he took
&gt; matters into his own hands.  Was this not the reason that he was *voted*
&gt; into position?  It's his job to deal with the flack and I think he's done
&gt; so.  People may not have agreed with it, but there was action and in the
&gt; long run that's what we asked for.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the Copyright/Licensing debate that's been going on (for how long
&gt; now?) I'm afraid it has gotten old and extremely tired.  I think it's
&gt; great that we come up with something that we can *all* live with, but the
&gt; area seems to have been completely blurred between Copyright and
&gt; Licensing. And to think that we can at this time mandate something of this
&gt; sort is beyond me.  The LDP is *not* in the position to mandate a matter
&gt; like this, at least not right now.  My personal opinion is that
&gt; an unofficial &quot;offical&quot; manifesto should be written up and put out for
&gt; public display and scrutiny, and let's move on.  What is in place now is
&gt; sufficient and has been for all these years with minor tweaking along the
&gt; way.  I've always told authors to use what's in place if *they* are
&gt; comfortable with it....not me.  If they choose to tweak it to *their*
&gt; liking then that is *their* perrogative.  Please for the sake of the LDP
&gt; let this matter be put aside.  Perhaps someone outside the LDP would be
&gt; more suitable for this task?
&gt; 
&gt; As for the CVS matter, I will say this.  *I* (and don't believe that
&gt; anyone else did) did not turn down Metalab there offer of CVS?  As
&gt; a matter of fact, the one person (me) responsible for getting the updates
&gt; to Metalab has not even discussed the matter of CVS with anyone at
&gt; Metalab.  Another mis-communication, I would say, but it's problems like
&gt; these that we're trying to improve on.  Yes, I have been working on a CVS
&gt; solution, does that mean that I would not choose to use Metalab if their
&gt; services were offered, not only no, but heck no.  I would gladly accept!
&gt; I am working on the finer details of the CVS and how things will be
&gt; handled.  Everyone assumes that all these processes are magically
&gt; implemented, ok maybe that's not assumed, but it's definately the
&gt; impression left by many comments.  To just throw all the doucment source
&gt; out there and made available via CVS won't solve anything if measures are
&gt; not put into place to protect the docs and their processing/updating?  If
&gt; it's only a CVS that's needed/wanted then sure, gimme an hour or two.
&gt; This is not our goal!  Long term solutions is the bottom-line.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been preparing a revised QC manifesto that will be published by the
&gt; end of the week.  I hope this will solve and/or answer many questions.  My
&gt; main objective here is to give all authors/maintainers a means of tracking
&gt; progress.  This along with the quality of work *will* be our main
&gt; objectives.  And some sort of bug tracking will also be implemented.
&gt; 
&gt; I have talked to Guylhem (not at length) about making my final comments to
&gt; ldp-discuss on all the uproar the past few days, so here I am.
&gt; Unfortunately he misunderstood and thought I was wanting to step down.  
&gt; This was not my intent, but the thought has consumed me over the past 24+
&gt; hours and perhaps his misunderstanding is something I should actually
&gt; consider at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; If the LDP is suffering because of me then the matter should be addressed
&gt; and handled appropriately (respectively goes w/out saying).  I will
&gt; entertain the idea of stepping down if it is in fact in the best interest
&gt; of the LDP.  Linux has given me far too much to let my pride get in the
&gt; way of progress.
&gt; 
&gt; As for disgruntled authors removing their documents from the LDP, just
&gt; doesn't sit well with me.  Sure, if that's what they want....then let them
&gt; move on.  I honestly can't believe this is the route they would choose to
&gt; take, but if it is......well perhaps they should.  I do know this, if
&gt; every disgruntled Linux coder had the same views, we would *not* be having
&gt; this dicussion b/c there would be no Linux.  To up and go taking your docs
&gt; with you is just plain childish.  That is *not* directed at Vladimir, but
&gt; more to any author who feels this way.  If I have personal comments for
&gt; any author, I'll do the repectful thing and personally make them.....not
&gt; publicly.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps this is my undoing, but I honestly felt that something had to be
&gt; said.  I have too much respect for everyone involved to just let it pass
&gt; and allow the discomfort that is present now to continue. I owe it to you
&gt; as well as myself to rectify any and all problems/complaints that are
&gt; directly related to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt; Tim
