&gt; The author seems to mix Hugo van der Kooij and Norman Walsh. So this
&gt; bucket of water will cool the heat of this flame.
&gt; &lt;/Water&gt;

Oh, darn, sorry about that.  I know who both of you are, and I didn't get
the two of you mixed up, but &quot;van der Walhs&quot; is stuck in my brain from a
chemistry course.  My sincerest appologizies.

&gt; 
&gt; Too complicated.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if we know the difference between a FAQ and an HOWTO, 
&gt; most ppl take
&gt; this as &quot;documentation&quot;.

I don't know if I'd agree with this, but I have no supporting evidence.  The
names seem fairly obvious to me, and if we have a blurb above each section
explaining what that type of document is, then it should be clear enough on
how to find things.  Greg F had a good suggestion with the README.  in
LDP/README it should tell how the directory structure is layed out, and have
an explanation of what a FAQ, HOWTO, GUIDE,  etc are.  Here's a rough sketch
of one for FAQ&quot;
FAQ 
	FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions.  Look here if you've got
a question that you want answered, or are looking to find out what the most
common problems and glitches are pertaining to a specific topic.  

OK, so that's pretty bad, I can't think of anything better right off.  Then
within LDP/FAQ/ the README file should contain something similar to the
section above, followed by a list of the FAQs that are available.  And so-on
and so-forth with the other things, and perhaps for the formats.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; HTML, then either plain text or LaTeX or Tex.  We should 
&gt; not accept source
&gt; &gt; in pdf, or ps, or any of the ones that I've not mentioned 
&gt; here.  This
&gt; 
&gt; It can be accepted as a guide, as long as the license is 
&gt; compatible with
&gt; our requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; The format is not a problem, if the document is *very* interesting we
&gt; can convert it or retype it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This should have a pointer to the manifesto so that they 
&gt; know what our
&gt; &gt; requirements are.
&gt; 
&gt; Will add links to each question
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This doesn't sound too good, it implies that we don't want this many
&gt; &gt; documents submitted.  We want MORE documents submitted, not 
&gt; less, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Right, I will rephrase that :
&gt; &lt;&lt;
&gt; However, there are far too many docs submitted to ldp-submit 
&gt; for our 2«
&gt; peer readers.
&gt; 
&gt; They can not proof read each document ; if you feel like helping them«
&gt; please subscribe to ldp-submit (mail 
&gt; ldp-submit-request@lists.linuxdoc.org)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the LDP-editors@lists.linuxdoc.org, as a place to submit 
&gt; documents for
&gt; &gt; grammar/style/markup editing, and the LDP-submit list 
&gt; should become an
&gt; &gt; automated submission mechanism.  
&gt; 
&gt; Good idea ; I will mail the listmaster to create that list ASAP.
&gt; 
&gt; Documents will first go to ldp-editors for grammar and spelling (and
&gt; maybe peer review?), then move to ldp-submit for final submission.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that we should be singling (sp?) out any 
&gt; particular HOWTOs, but
&gt; &gt; perhaps pointing them to the page ordered by date that Greg 
&gt; F has created.  
&gt; 
&gt; What's the url?

<A  HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/sorted_howtos.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/sorted_howtos.html</A>

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; writing &quot;sexier&quot; (I really don't believe that it's going to 
&gt; get me any
&gt; &gt; dates, but what the heck) by helping out with the LDP, 
&gt; either by sending
&gt; 
&gt; Don't laugh, it got me one in october.
&gt; 
&gt; Her brother felt like working for a linux company so she asked me to
&gt; introduce him (it's chocking ! I never saw that before !!!)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; nicest, most efficient code you've ever seen.  I'd have to 
&gt; say that /.er's
&gt; &gt; quote isn't appropraite for this follow-up, nor is this statement.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok will remove it, but it's exactly my opinion (you can't 
&gt; code want you
&gt; can't think)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; criticize your
&gt; &gt; &gt; HOWTO they didn't even read.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I like the re-write that somebody proposed much better than 
&gt; this paragraph,
&gt; &gt; it makes it sound like you shouldn't care if somebody 
&gt; bashes your HOWTO.
&gt; 
&gt; I care if there's a good reason, unfortunately most of the 
&gt; time there's
&gt; no reason at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Pure flaming for the pleasure (goes to /dev/null BTW)

Ah, now if MS had created a /dev/null so that it could be directed there
before it even left the originating machine, wouldn't life be a lot better?
:)  Later,
	Greg
