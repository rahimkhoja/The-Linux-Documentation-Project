LINUX EXPO 2000 NORTH AMERICA
FIRST INTERNATIONAL CROSSROADS FOR OSS AND LINUX SOLUTIONS
TO TAKE PLACE IN MONTREAL, AT THE PALAIS DES CONGRÈS
APRIL 10-12, 2000


Montreal, February 8, 2000 - The very first international crossroads devoted to
OSS software and Linux solutions will take place at Montreal's Palais des
Congrès from April 10 to 12. During those three days, all the key actors in the
worldwide Linux and OSS universe will be there : users, programmers,
manufacturers, resellers, integrators, consultants, decision-makers and .
investors. It is a Canadian first. www.skyevents.com.
LINUX EXPO offers attendees and exhibitors from all horizons an opportunity to
share information and networks in an international and cosmopolitan atmosphere.
Here is a chance to find out why Linux and other OSS software products are
revolutionizing the world of information technology on a daily basis, intriguing
the world of international finance, and altogether upsetting the established
order in the software industry. &quot;Linux Expo is an international event that
stands as a very good illustration of the Linux universe, its diversity and also
its intellectual and technological fervor&quot;, says Stéphane Labrouche,
Vice-President of the Sky Events Group.
LINUX EXPO 2000 NORTH AMERICA is an initiative of the Sky Events Group,
organizer of the LINUX EXPO shows around the world ( Paris, Madrid, Toronto, Sao
Paulo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney and Shanghai). The Sky Events Group also
edits the Linux and OSS Software Solutions Guide, and organizes the Conference
Road Show &amp; University Linux Expo.
Held at the crossroads of many economic powerhouses, LINUX EXPO brings together
all the key players in the market, whether European, North or South American or
Asian. &quot;We have opted for Montreal as our home base because it is the perfect
location to expand into North America&quot;, says Mr. Labrouche, who adds that &quot;our
Montreal offices are in fact the headquarters for all our activities in the
Americas&quot;.

A number of important events, some of them unprecedented, are scheduled to take
place as part of LINUX EXPO. It is those very events that distinguish LINUX EXPO
from a simple trade show.

KEYNOTE SESSION, TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 8 : 30 P.M.
Be they CEOs of big corporations or Linux gurus, the biggest players in the
Linux market will be there, making the event a perfect occasion to take stock of
the key trends and prospects in the market for OSS and Linux solutions.  BOB
YOUNG (President, Red Hat), LARRY M. AUGUSTIN (CEO, VA Linux), MICHAEL COWPLAND
(CEO, Corel Corp.), ERIC S. RAYMOND (VA Linux), MARK JARVIS (VP Global
Marketing - Oracle Corp.) and many others will be on hand at LINUX EXPO to
attend this extraordinary conference.

CAPITAL LINUX, MONDAY, APRIL 10 AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL
The OSS and Linux world is in such effervescence that there just had to be an
opportunity to promote encounters between the emerging start-ups in this booming
market and international top venture capitalists.

Linux Capital, a one-day unprecedented conference, certainly fits the bill.  It
will allow the twenty selected start-ups to describe their needs and goals and
make their case to a gathering of key decision-makers from the world of
international finance. All the deals reached as a result of this event will be
announced on www.skyevents.com.

INTERNATIONAL &amp; START-UP PAVILION
The international pavilion will gather foreign start-up companies (Europe, Latin
America, Asia) looking for the right conditions to explore the North American
market.

LINUX GENERATION
The Linux generation will show up in strength at LINUX EXPO. The activities of
the many international associations (GNOME, Debian, etc.) and LUGs (Linux Users
Groups) are a testimony to their essential contribution to the Linux boom so
far, and of its strength in the future.

LINUX RESOURCES FORUM
Linux is the future and LINUX EXPO stands as a perfect illustration. The Linux
Resources Forum aims to serve as a clearinghouse to match the demand and supply
of qualified OSS and Linux specialists and developers in both Canadian and
international companies. Some job interviews will take place right on the
premises.

THREE-DAY CONFERENCE AND TUTORIAL PROGRAM
The programming committee has identified a number of themes of great interest to
all international visitors. And it has come up with a full three days of high
level conferences and tutorials, hosted by expert professionals and all
featuring simultaneous French and English translation.

All visitors who pre-register at www.skyevents.com will be admitted for free at
LINUX EXPO.  Otherwise, admission at the door will cost CAN $20. Every visitor
will receive the Linux and OSS Software Solutions Guide, and a ticket to attend
the keynote session. Admittance to all the conference and tutorials is available
for a package fee of CAN $375 and $120 for students.
