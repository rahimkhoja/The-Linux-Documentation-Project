From: &quot;Andrew P Moise&quot; &lt;moise+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
&gt;   Okay, it seems that the consensus is in favor of an Algorithms-HOWTO,
&gt; and I've started writing.  What follows is the outline I'm working from
&gt; now; I'd appreciate any comments, criticisms, and suggestions.

Thanks for taking the time to post an outline. I think early feedback will
make it a better HOWTO.

&gt;   As I see it now, the HOWTO will serve a double purpose -- to
&gt; familiarize inexperienced programmers with the tools of the trade, and
&gt; as a reference to point experienced programmers to specific algorithms
&gt; they need.
&gt;   I'm planning on coding the examples in C, and aiming it at people
&gt; already fluent enough to sling mallocs, structs, and pointers around
&gt; with relative ease.  C is pretty ugly, but it's also the closest thing
&gt; we have to a common language, and it's also a good lowest common
&gt; denominator -- if you can implement it in C, you can implement it
&gt; anywhere.  I am amenable to a &quot;Primer for the C-impaired&quot; section if
&gt; many people think it would be essential to briefly explain some of C's
&gt; unique gotchas (returning stack structs comes to mind), but I'd like to
&gt; keep to the flavor of the LDP and keep it as terse and focused as
&gt; possible.

Hmmmmmm. The data structures and algorithms themselves tend to be fairly
language-independent (conceptually), but obviously the implementations
vary. Perhaps some enterprising soul(s) might translate your C examples
into other languages. Are you open to the idea of providing worked
examples in multiple languages? Maybe in a later revision, since you
obviously have plenty of work ahead of you already.

I would not recommend including a primer for C. Keep your focus to the
algorithms; it's a big job in itself. If you *do* write a C primer, I'd
like to see it as a separate document that might eventually be expanded
into a full guide to C programming.

Please consider licensing the &quot;examples&quot; under the GPL explicitly, rather
than under whatever documentation license you use for the rest. That will
allow free software projects to cut-and-paste your code, and could make
your HOWTO into a really valuable resource for them. An interesting
side-issue this raises is that the GPL would then require said programmers
to return to you any improvements to your algorithms! Woo hoo!

&gt;   Here's the outline; items marked with ? are tentative:

I'm going to make only a few comments about the actual algorithms you've
selected. I'll try to make some more after referring to my Knuth!

&gt; Introduction
&gt;     Copyright
&gt;     Intent &amp; scope
&gt;     Design advice?
&gt;     Big-O analysis??

Algorithmic analysis probably deserves its own complete section, rather
than an entry in the introduction.

&gt;     Primer for the C-impaired??
&gt;     ??
&gt;
&gt;   I have no idea, yet, exactly what I'm introducing.
&gt;
&gt; Linked Lists
&gt;     Singly linked lists
&gt;     Doubly linked lists
&gt;     Circular lists
&gt;
&gt; Hash Tables
&gt;     Overview
&gt;     Chaining buckets
&gt;     Overflow hashing
&gt;     Sloppy hashing
&gt;     Notes
&gt;
&gt;   At some point, I will bother to find out the proper names for the
&gt; different flavors of hashing, if any exist.
&gt;
&gt; Tree structures
&gt;     Heterogenous trees
&gt;     Binary trees
&gt;     Balancing trees?
&gt;     Tree structures are for weenies
&gt;
&gt;   That last section is mostly a warning about the relative rarity of
&gt; trees in real programming; I hate sounding as much like an intro CS
&gt; class as I am, but understanding trees really is pretty vital to
&gt; understanding heaps.
&gt;
&gt; Ordering structures
&gt;     Linked-list queues
&gt;     Array queues
&gt;     Circular buffers [of characters]
&gt;     Heaps
&gt;     Linked-list stacks?
&gt;     Array stacks
&gt;
&gt; Recursion
&gt;     Basic recursion
&gt;     Tail recursion
&gt;     Memoization
&gt;     Weak memoization? [caching]
&gt;     Dynamic programming?
&gt;
&gt; Sorting and searching
&gt;     Don't do it yourself
&gt;     Quicksort
&gt;     Stable sorting?
&gt;     Binary search
&gt;
&gt; Further Reading
&gt;     Stop reading and code

Yeah!

&gt;     Search space problems?
&gt;     Geometric algorithms
&gt;     Graph algorithms
&gt;     Unreliable algorithms?? [Miller-Rabin, and ... ?]
&gt;     Multiprocessing
&gt;     Cryptography

Here's an entire HOWTO in itself. Your whole outline is very ambitious!

&gt;     State machines
&gt;     Lexers and parsers
&gt;     Compiler technology?
&gt;     Genetic algorithms?
&gt;     Systems programming
&gt;     Graphics algorithms?
&gt;     Optimization?
&gt;     Miscellaneous resources
&gt;
&gt;   This will be a set of pointers to good documentation on advanced
&gt; stuff; if any of you have such pointers lying around, I'd greatly
&gt; appreciate you emailing them to me (the same goes for good web
&gt; documentation on any of the other sections; at present I anticipate a
&gt; heavy &quot;See also CLR&quot; concentration.)
&gt;
&gt;   At some point I'd like to throw in B-trees and Fibonacci heaps and all
&gt; (the original plan called for a &quot;Wierd Shit&quot; chapter), but this is
&gt; already plenty ambitious enough to keep me busy for a while.
&gt;   I'd particularly like to hear that there's an important algorithm that
&gt; I've forgotten about.  As soon as I have some sort of reasonable subset
&gt; of this done, I'll post it here for stylistic advice; 'till then, I look
&gt; forward to your input.  Cheers.


Great outline. I look forward to seeing the first draft.
