As someone who recently joined this list because he was interested in
writing a HOWTO, I think it is important to make it easy for an author who
has a desire to contribute, and an idea for, documentation to create it
in a format that LDP will accept. No offense to anyone who has worked on
the guidelines in the past, but the first time I looked into the
procedure to create a document in the recommended format for submission to
LDP documentation my head started to spin. I understand the need to make
the documentation portable, but if a potential contributor needs to learn
a whole new program (to them), such as LinuxDoc or DocBook, or jump
through a number of hoops to submit their documentation, they might just
decide it is not worth the effort.

&gt; Sorry for my delay in getting to this.  I somehow have an aversion to
&gt; dealing with it.  In this post I'll only comment on section 4: FILE
&gt; FORMAT RECOMMENDATIONS (new) or DOCUMENT CONVENTIONS (old):
&gt; 
&gt; Old manifesto:
&gt; 
&gt; 4. DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS
&gt; 
&gt;    Here are the conventions that are currently used for LDP documents. If
&gt;    you are interested in writing another document using different
&gt;    conventions, please let us know of your plans first.
&gt;    
&gt;    All HOWTO documents must be in one of the two SGML formats: LinuxDoc
&gt;    or DocBook. LinuxDoc is the simplest while DocBook is more complex
&gt;    with more features.
&gt;    
&gt;    The guides -- full books produced by the LDP -- have historically been
&gt;    done in LaTeX, as their primary goal has been to be printed
&gt;    documentation. However, guide authors have been moving towards SGML
&gt;    with the DocBook DTD, because it allows them to create more different
&gt;    kinds of output, both printed and on-line. If you use LaTeX, we have a
&gt;    style file you can use to keep your printed look consistent with other
&gt;    LDP documents.
&gt;    
&gt;    The man pages -- the Unix standard for online manuals -- are created
&gt;    with the Unix standard nroff man (or BSD mdoc) macros.
&gt;                ______________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Manifesto:
&gt;    
&gt; 4. FILE FORMAT RECOMMENDATIONS
&gt; 
&gt;    We are concerned that:
&gt;      * Documents will not be accessible to blind people or to people who
&gt;        depend on voice-reading applications
&gt;      * Free documentation will lose support and become less available
&gt;      * Free documentation will not be readily discovered, administered or
&gt;        searched
&gt;      * Free documentation will not be easily modifiable or extensible
&gt;      * Free documentation will not be available in a human readable
&gt;        format, as a &quot;transparent&quot; source
&gt;      * Documentation will not be freely distributable in a legally
&gt;        unrestricted way
&gt;        
&gt;    To overcome these concerns, we recommend:
&gt;      * source file formats that can be converted to the following output
&gt;        formats:
&gt;           + high resolution formats for typesetting such as DVI or
&gt;             Postscript, which support images
&gt;           + low resolution format (plain text) for low bandwidth or
&gt;             text-only devices
&gt;           + HTML for the current generation of Web browsers
&gt;           + Info (HTML and Info provide for both sighted and blind
&gt;             people)
&gt;      * support for comprehensive meta-data for discovery, collocation,
&gt;        evaluation, administration, authentication and search
&gt;      * transparent source (clear text editable by a generic editor,
&gt;        images in an open format)
&gt;                ______________________________________________
&gt;    
&gt; My comments:  The old manifesto clearly specifies what we require for
&gt; HOWOTOs.  Here it is:
&gt; 
&gt;    All HOWTO documents must be in one of the two SGML formats: LinuxDoc
&gt;    or DocBook. LinuxDoc is the simplest while DocBook is more complex
&gt;    with more features.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been stated that one may submit in plain text and then someone
&gt; will convert it.  But this will be difficult if there is no abstract
&gt; or sectionalization of the text document.
&gt; 
&gt; If the Manifesto is going to go into the reasons why we use certain
&gt; source formats, this needs to be kept very brief IMO.  We must not
&gt; only consider what is best for readers but what is easy for authors
&gt; including ones not familiar with a markup language.  What is proposed
&gt; only considers the needs of the readers.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. FILE FORMAT RECOMMENDATIONS
&gt; 
&gt;    We are concerned that:
&gt;      * Documents will not be accessible to blind people or to people who
&gt;        depend on voice-reading applications
&gt; Wouldn't it be simpler to say that we would like our docs to be
&gt; accessible to a wide audience including people who use old hardware or
&gt; are vision impaired.  Many people erroneously think that blind people
&gt; can't see at all, but many of them are only partially blind.
&gt; 
&gt;      * Free documentation will lose support and become less available
&gt; What does this have to do with format?
&gt; 
&gt;      * Free documentation will not be readily discovered, administered or
&gt;        searched
&gt; Most of the solution to this doesn't depend on the format.
&gt; 
&gt;      * Free documentation will not be easily modifiable or extensible
&gt; This depends on the license and also on the format but people who read
&gt; the manifesto will not understand the implications.
&gt; 
&gt;      * Free documentation will not be available in a human readable
&gt;        format, as a &quot;transparent&quot; source
&gt; Again, many will not grasp the implications.
&gt; 
&gt;      * Documentation will not be freely distributable in a legally
&gt;        unrestricted way
&gt; What has this to do with format?       
&gt; 
&gt;    To overcome these concerns, we recommend:
&gt;      * source file formats that can be converted to the following output
&gt;        formats:
&gt;           + high resolution formats for typesetting such as DVI or
&gt;             Postscript, which support images
&gt;           + low resolution format (plain text) for low bandwidth or
&gt;             text-only devices
&gt;           + HTML for the current generation of Web browsers
&gt;           + Info (HTML and Info provide for both sighted and blind
&gt;             people)
&gt; 
&gt; The info system is complicated to use and I don't like it (but am
&gt; forced to use in sometimes).  I'm not sure we need to convert into it.
&gt; 
&gt;      * support for comprehensive meta-data for discovery, collocation,
&gt;        evaluation, administration, authentication and search
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that it's a lot of extra effort for the authors to
&gt; add metadata.  I think for most HOWTOs it would be much more
&gt; productive to improve their content and quality.  Since the sgmls 
&gt; we use allows one to create new tags, I don't think there is any need
&gt; to mention this.
&gt; 
&gt;      * transparent source (clear text editable by a generic editor,
&gt;        images in an open format)
&gt;                ______________________________________________
&gt; I really think we need to start over and redo this section from scratch.  The
&gt; &quot;Old manifesto&quot; was not written by me.  I only revised it and kept most of
&gt; the previous stuff.  Thus I think that it needs improvement.  In
&gt; addition, circumstances have changed.  So I'm not proposing that we
&gt; use the old one.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that the manifesto (or some other &quot;official&quot; document) should
&gt; mention what formats we accept.  This section  shouldn't be called
&gt; &quot;recommendations&quot; but &quot;requirements&quot; or &quot;conventions&quot;.  Otherwise
&gt; people will think that we accept any format and not bother to read it.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I would say (in part):
&gt; 
&gt; We distribute LDP documentation in various formats such as HTML,
&gt; Postscript, and plain text.  Authors write in a format which can be
&gt; converted (by computer) to these formats (and more).  Formats which 
&gt; can be so converted include: DocBook or LinuxDoc (both are
&gt; SGML languages).  HOWTOs should be in one of these formats.  If you
&gt; use DocBook check first to see which versions we accept.
&gt; 
&gt; You may see what these sgml formats look like by downloading a HOWTO
&gt; (in sgml) from an LDP site.  We may accept a HOWTO in just plain text
&gt; if we can find someone to manually convert it to DocBook, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; [Add here whatever policy we want for the guides and FAQs.]
