Due to fringertrouble at my end this went to Greg Ferguson alone, I
intended it to go to the list, sorry about that.

This is getting big, I have trimmed quite a bit...

&gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO, while the LDP is amazing, let's not kid ourselves about quality.

&gt; &gt; Sadly true. So when is the core team going to post a request
&gt; &gt; for new authors or maintainers on <A  HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce">news:comp.os.linux.announce</A> ?
&gt; &gt; It wouldn't cost to try.
&gt; 
&gt; There is no longer a core team; there are volunteers. If you would
&gt; like to take on that task, I think everyone involved with the LDP
&gt; would be most appreciative!

I'll be happy to do the web promotion and I hope to finish a
NetHelp framework to demonstrate a potentialy more userfriendly
format for HOWTOs.

Having been remarkably unsuccessful in getting feedback from
Slashdot poll system, I'll leave the people-to-people promotion
to someone more successful.

&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt;  To this aim, we need a charismatic leader or group of leaders,
&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt;&gt; who can accept and refuse works without offending anybody.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No, we need a process whereby docs can be rated and comments attached
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the user base.  We need stats to show which docs are actually read,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a followup process which asks the reader if the doc was actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; helpful.  This is basic Customer Support 101.

See note later on about the Freshmeat mechanism...

&gt; &gt; To get proper stats we also need to promote. I did some automated
&gt; &gt; web promotion of my HOWTO and raised the hit counts from
&gt; &gt; about 50 a day to 300-500 a day. What has the core team done in
&gt; &gt; this respect? This is hardly the firt time I ask/suggest but I
&gt; &gt; have yet to see an answer. Some actual hit stats from the LDP
&gt; &gt; site would tell us how we are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, anyone part of this mailing list, anyone that has used
&gt; the LDP, anyone that likes what they see can assist in promoting
&gt; the LDP. Posting to the ng's is no doubt a good place to start.
&gt; Placing links to the TPL on individual websites is another.

Agreed, very much.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we should treat authors like software authors: When someone is
&gt; &gt; &gt; the maintainer of a software package, they put their email address on
&gt; &gt; &gt; it. They _expect_ to receive bug reports and gripes which are then
&gt; &gt; &gt; folded back into the software to improve it.  When it gets to be too
&gt; &gt; &gt; much for them, they hand the reigns to someone else.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;   How about this: A new display engine on the website which lists the
&gt; &gt; &gt;   requested doc in the right frame, but down the left margin lists
&gt; &gt; &gt;   the title, the date, author contact info and the version numbers of
&gt; &gt; &gt;   mentioned software.  Below this is a survey form that says &quot;How
&gt; &gt; &gt;   useful is this doc?&quot;  Then, once we have a significant database of
&gt; &gt; &gt;   reviews, when someone searches for a doc, the search results page
&gt; &gt; &gt;   shows the title of the document followed by its review metrics, its
&gt; &gt; &gt;   age and the version numbers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good idea, I second this.
&gt; 
&gt; I *like* the idea, but I'm worried about us modifying the display
&gt; in any way, shape or form...especially using frames. Call it
&gt; paranoia.

Sorry, I was too quick, I dislike the frame mechanism but the
table tags can be put to good use here. Take the HOWTO
index page, run it through a script to add on the survey,
comments field etc. or use the Freshmeat method.

&gt; How about, for a start, just a simple way to provide feedback - a
&gt; page linked to from the other &quot;main&quot; pages we have on the LDP? It
&gt; may at least help to garner some form of feedback. I realize it isn't
&gt; quite the fine-grained functionality we'd like to have/need, but it
&gt; is a start.
&gt; 
&gt; I can put together a form and then collect and/or email the
&gt; results from each inquiry; if this is an approach we decide
&gt; upon. Like I said, it's a starting point; it might remove the
&gt; intimidation factor some people might feel wrt emailing an
&gt; author directly.

A user writable web log would lessen the burden of maintaining
the system, something I feel is important given the limited
resources.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Part of this is also proper dating of material.  All LDP docs should
&gt; &gt; &gt; say right at the top the date of last revision, and the search engine
&gt; &gt; &gt; results must tell me this.  What good is it to find a ppp-2.1 or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; kernel-2.0 doc?  Maybe I really am looking for help with old
&gt; &gt; &gt; technology, but I will bet real money most queries against the LDP
&gt; &gt; &gt; search engine are looking for help with the most recent Linux
&gt; &gt; &gt; distributions --- the vast majority of the Linux users out there today
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been using Linux for less than a year.

Perhaps the HOWTO HOWTO should have a few notes about
obligatory parts such as
 - date
 - version number
 - email address
 - document homepage

&gt; &gt; Again this is not the first time this topic comes up and many
&gt; &gt; authors were approached by a 3.rd party willing to take up that
&gt; &gt; job. Nothing has been heard of since.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I proposed an automated cooperation with Freshmeat, another idea
&gt; &gt; that sunk mostly without a trace. Yet when I check the place
&gt; &gt;       <A  HREF="http://freshmeat.net/search.php3?query=HOWTO">http://freshmeat.net/search.php3?query=HOWTO</A>
&gt; &gt; I find 17 HOWTOs have quietly been registered, and tracking
&gt; &gt; numbers and dating is done, an example:
&gt; &gt;       <A  HREF="http://freshmeat.net/appindex/1999/06/26/930410556.html">http://freshmeat.net/appindex/1999/06/26/930410556.html</A>
&gt; &gt; Looking closer I notice it is possible for users to make
&gt; &gt; comments directly to those web pages. It does look like
&gt; &gt; Freshmeat ALREADY has done what we have talked about.

I would like to add that you also get click-though statistics
for each document, that could save us a lot of work.



&gt; &gt; I suggest we get a TODO list of good ideas up. Many ideas come
&gt; &gt; up again and again and sink without trace. I think even a TODO
&gt; &gt; list was mentioned some time ago but funnily enough nothing
&gt; &gt; happened.
&gt; 
&gt; Start sending me items, I'll put one together.

OK, a few points:
 - Add META tags to the LDP homepage, that can improve ranking
  on many search engines
 - Ask the maintainer of the Pedia to join LDP, if not we should
  add a link to his page
 - Many have links to LDP, it is only polite to return the favour,
  also there are many links to zines we could add
 - add a link to FAQs
 - An idea from IMDB, add links to &quot;related topics&quot;, for instance
  for the Multi Disk HOWTO the Partitioning- , Partition Rescue- ,
  Large Disk HOWTO are relevant. Again links to Usenet News FAQs
  could be relevant
 - Consider a link to OSWG; while politically sensitive here we
  should not forget the end users might benefit here
 - Get the rest of the HOWTOs registered with Freshmeat
 - Ask Linux Weekly News to get a small section on LDP news,
  perhaps best place is their Development section
 - run an automated robot to look for broken links in documents;
  many like me don't have the net access to do this well
 - Approach the various distribution compilers to join this
  mailing list, and persuade them to keep fresh LDP HOWTO archives
  in their errata section
 - Make an intro.ldp manpage to point out to users where to find
  the HOWTOs on their disks, not all know of /usr/doc/HOWTO
 - Make the TODO list, with dates on submission and completion
 - 

(have to stop, machine about to crash...)

   Stein Gjoen
