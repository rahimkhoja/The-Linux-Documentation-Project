I got some feedback on the proposed texts I posted 1.st february on
 - announcement text
 - intro.ldp manpage source
 - intro.txt the above formatted

Additionally I am here submitting a proposal to the
stub manpage for my own Multi Disk HOWTO, a manpage
that I hope can make man -k &lt;keyword&gt; also find the
HOWTO collection.

So, once again: please give me feedback!

(Straight off I just noticed the stub manpage didn't format well
but I am not good at manpage authoring.)

I feel the announcement should be sent by the main
contact address for the LDP, otherwise I am likely to
receive a lot of incorrectly adressed email.

==(Announcement)===


After some restructuring of the Linux Documentation Project (LDP)
we feel ready to serve the Linux community from the new home:
	<A  HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A>

The LDP has collected and produced numerous documents such as
 - guides
 - HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs
 - FAQs
 - man pages
and more.

All in all the LDP endeavors to produce and provide a one-stop source of
information relating to the various aspects of Linux. There is now also
a search engine on the front page to help you quickly and efficiently
locate the documents you need. If you have a question, chances are you
will find what you need here.

These documents are produced for you, the end users. That means if there
is anything in the documents you find unclear, ambiguous or incorrect
you should not hesitate in contacting the author. While the workload of
the authors in general may be high and cannot be expected to answer specific
problems you may have on your machine, generally authors are only happy to
receive feedback on the documents.

Likewise, if you feel you have something to contribute or you wish to try
your hands as an LDP author you are welcome to contact the LDP coordinator
with your inputs (see the HOWTO-HOWTO). Remember that new documents are
produced all the time so it is important to contact the LDP before you
start writing in order to eliminate the possibility of duplicate work.

Remember that you do not have to be on-line to read the HOWTOs, in many
cases these documents are installed with your Linux distribution and can
be found at
	file:///usr/doc/HOWTO	/usr/doc/HOWTO/

Regards,
   Stein Gjoen
