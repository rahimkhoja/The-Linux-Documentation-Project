I wrote this HOWTO, and figured I might as well pass it on to you guys
for possible inclusion in the main HOWTO index.

This is my first HOWTO, and I will finish reading the HOTO-HOWTO
tomorrow. At this point I dont know how I would even update it if you
guys choose to include it in your lists.

I did all the sgml tagging by hand, so I hope its formatted well enough
for you guys

<abstract>
  This document is about building a mail server that will
  support virtual domain hosting and provide smtp, pop3 and imap services, 
  using a powerful alternative to sendmail.
</abstract>

<toc>
<sect>Introduction<label id="Introduction" > 
<p>
  Before you start reading: I am not a native speaker, so there are
  probably spelling/grammatical errors in this document. Feel encouraged
  to inform me of mistakes.
</p>

<sect1>What is Qmail and why should I use it?<label id="WhatisQmail" > 
<p>
  Here is the authors (Dan Bernstein) blurb:

  Qmail is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message transfer agent.
  It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
  typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts.

  Secure: Security isn't just a goal, but an absolute requirement. Mail
  delivery is critical for users; it cannot be turned off, so it must be
  completely secure. (This is why I started writing qmail: I was sick of
  the security holes in sendmail and other MTAs.)

  Reliable: qmail's straight-paper-path philosophy guarantees that a
  message, once accepted into the system, will never be lost. qmail also
  supports maildir, a new, super-reliable user mailbox format. Maildirs,
  unlike mbox files and mh folders, won't be corrupted if the system
  crashes during delivery. Even better, not only can a user safely read
  his mail over NFS, but any number of NFS clients can deliver mail to
  him at the same time.

  Efficient: On a Pentium under BSD/OS, qmail can easily sustain 200000
  local messages per day---that's separate messages injected and
  delivered to mailboxes in a real test! Although remote deliveries are
  inherently limited by the slowness of DNS and SMTP, qmail overlaps 20
  simultaneous deliveries by default, so it zooms quickly through
  mailing lists. (This is why I finished qmail: I had to get a big
  mailing list set up.)

  Simple: qmail is vastly smaller than any other Internet MTA. Some
  reasons why: (1) Other MTAs have separate forwarding, aliasing, and
  mailing list mechanisms. qmail has one simple forwarding mechanism
  that lets users handle their own mailing lists. (2) Other MTAs offer a
  spectrum of delivery modes, from fast+unsafe to slow+queued. qmail-
  send is instantly triggered by new items in the queue, so the qmail
  system has just one delivery mode: fast+queued. (3) Other MTAs
  include, in effect, a specialized version of inetd that watches the
  load average.  qmail's design inherently limits the machine load, so
  qmail-smtpd can safely run from your system's inetd.

  Replacement for sendmail: qmail supports host and user masquerading,
  full host hiding, virtual domains, null clients, list-owner rewriting,
  relay control, double-bounce recording, arbitrary RFC 822 address
  lists, cross-host mailing list loop detection, per-recipient
  checkpointing, downed host backoffs, independent message retry
  schedules, etc. In short, it's up to speed on modern MTA features.
  qmail also includes a drop-in ``sendmail'' wrapper so that it will be
  used transparently by your current UAs.
</p>

<sect1>What is VMailMgr and why should I use it?<label id="WhatisVMailMgr" > 
<p>
  VMailMgr is:<p>
  A password checking interface between qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d which 
  replaces the usual checkpassword, as well as an authentication module 
  for Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual mailboxes by one of 
  three methods: 
<itemize>
  <item> IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user) 
  <item> username-based access (username-virtualuser) 
  <item> hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or virtualuser:virtual.host) 
</itemize>

  You should use it if:<p>
  You prefer to have the users manage their own domains email accounts, 
  and store their email in their own home dir.
  (This makes setting up disk space quotas much easier)
</p>

<sect1>What is Courier-imap and why should I use it?<label id="WhatisCourier" > 
<p>
  Courier-IMAP is:<p>
  A server that provides IMAP access to Maildir mailboxes. This IMAP server 
  does NOT handle traditional mailbox files (/var/spool/mail, and derivatives), 
  it was written for the specific purpose of providing IMAP access to Maildirs.

  You should use it because:<p>
  By default Qmail uses the newer more efficient Maildir format for storing email,
  and Courier-imap is the only imap server I am aware of that supports Maildir.
  So in short, if you use Qmail, and want imap support, you have to use it.
</p>
<sect1>Description of the components
<p>
  The email system you hopefully will get after having read this HOWTO is
  composed of several parts, the patched Qmail rpms are key to using this
  document. I recommend using the software versions I tried, they will 
  probably compile without many problems and result in a fairly stable 
  daemon. If you are courageous, you can try to compile all the 
  latest-stuff-with-tons-of-new-features, but  don't blame me if something
  fails ;-). However, you may report other working configurations to be 
  included in future versions of this document. All of the steps were tested
  on a RedHat Linux 6.2 box, so the HOWTO is somewhat specific, but you should
  be able to use it for other linux distributions as well.
<p>
  You do not necessarily have to install in all components. I tried to
  structure this HOWTO so that you can skip the parts you are not
  interested in.
<p>
  The document is neither a user manual to Qmail, VMailMgr nor
  Courier-imap. Its prime intention is to save email admins some
  headaches when installing their server and to do my little
  contribution to the linux community.
</p>
<sect1>Working configurations
<p>
  Though this document is new, I am pretty confident that it can help you
  get your email system up and running. 
  Combinations that work for me are:
<itemize>
  <item> RedHat 6.2, Linux 2.2.14, Qmail 1.03+patches-12, VMailMgr 0.96.5, Courier-imap 0.31
  <item> Mandrake 7.0, Linux 2.2.13, Qmail 1.03+patches-12, VMailMgr 0.96.5, Courier-imap 0.31
</itemize>

<sect1>History<label id="History" > 
<p>
  This document was started on April 18, 2000 by Dan Kuykendall after several installs of Qmail and VMailMgr.
  Then even more setups when Courier-imap support was ready.

<sect1>Acknowledgements and Thanks 
<p>
  Thanks to everyone that gave comments as I was writing this. This includes
  Bruce Guenter and other members of the vmailmgr-discuss list.
</p>
<sect>Component installation
<sect1>Preparations
<p>
  You have two options
<itemize>
  <item> Get and compile source rpms. 
         This has the benefit of being able to review the source before compiling,
         and compiling for your specific setup.
  <item> Or simply get the binary rpms. 
         This has the benefit of simplicity, and not having to worry about having the
         necessary libraries installed.
</itemize>
  I recommend using Bruce Guenter's rpm releases, since they are well patched, and
  its what I used for building my systems. 
</p>
<sect2>Get source rpms
<p>
  You will need:
<itemize>
  <item> ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/ucspi-tcp/">
  <item> daemontools-0.70-1.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/daemontools/"> 
  <item> supervise-scripts-2.4-1.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-scripts/">
  <item> qmail-1.03+patches-12.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/qmail+patches/">
  <item> vmailmgr-0.96.5-1.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/">
  <item> courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz - <url url="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/">
</itemize>
  For Courier-imap you must build the source rpm from the tar 
  file (instructions will follow).
</p>
<sect2>Get binary rpms
<p>
  Qmail does not come in binary form. Such packages are explicitly disallowed by 
  the author of Qmail, and frustrating as it may be, I understand his reasoning. 
<p>
  Courier-imap does not come in binary form, unless you want to use the one 
  I built. If you want mine, email me, and I will send it.
<p>
  VMailMgr does not come in binary form that supports Courier-imap, unless you 
  want to use the one I built. If you want mine, email me, and I will send it.
<itemize>
  <item> ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.i386.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/ucspi-tcp/">
  <item> daemontools-0.70-1.i386.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/daemontools/"> 
  <item> supervise-scripts-2.4-1.i386.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-scripts/">
  <item> qmail-1.03+patches-12.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/qmail+patches/">
  <item> vmailmgr-0.96.5-1.src.rpm - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/">
  <item> courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz - <url url="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/">
</itemize>
  For Courier-imap you must build the binary rpm from the tar 
  file (instructions will follow) or email me for my binary rpm.
</p>
<sect2>Get tarred sources (for non-RPM users)
<p>
  If your system does not have, or you do not use RPMS, you can install from source.
<itemize>
  <item> ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz - <url url="http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz">
  <item> daemontools-0.70.tar.gz - <url url="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.70.tar.gz">
  <item> supervise-scripts-2.4.tar.gz - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-scripts/">
  <item> qmail-1.03.tar.gz - <url url="http://cr.yp.to/software/qmail-1.03.tar.gz"> (*)
  <item> vmailmgr-0.96.5.tar.gz - <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/">
  <item> courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz - <url url="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/">
</itemize>

<tscreen>
  (*) There may be minor differences in these instructions due to the use of the standard
      Qmail package. Please review the documentation for Qmail and VMailMgr if any of
      the files deviates from my instructions.
</tscreen>

  Simply run the following command for each package
  <verb>rpm -ivh &lt;location&gt;/&lt;package.i386.rpm&gt;</verb>

  -Example-
<code>
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/ucspi-tcp-0.88-1.i386.rpm
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/daemontools-0.70-1.i386.rpm

</code>
</p>
<sect2>Install with source
<p>
  Run the following commands for each package
<verb>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
  cd <newly created dir>
  ./configure
  make
  (As root)
  make setup check (for ucspi-tcp and daemontools)
  or
  make install (for supervise-scripts)
</verb>

  -Example-
<code>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf supervise-scripts-2.4.tar.gz
  cd supervise-scripts-2.4

</code>
</p>
<sect1>Install Qmail
<sect2> Install with RPMS
<p>
<sect3>Compiling SRC.RPM's
<p>
  Simply run the following command
  <verb>rpm --rebuild <package.src.rpm></verb>

  -Example-
<code>
  rpm --rebuild qmail-1.03+patches-12.src.rpm
</code>
<sect3>
  Installing RPM's
<p>
  After compiling the source rpms, the binaries will be located 
  in <tt>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/</tt> or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package
  <verb>rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm></verb>

  -Example-
<code>
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-pop3d-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm

  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/qmail-smtpd-1.03+patches-12.i386.rpm
</code>

<verb>
  * note start *
  - Remove sendmail and any dependant applications prior to installing Qmail
  - by running the following command for each package
  - rpm -e <packagename>*
  - 
  - On my system I had to remove sendmail, so I typed
  - rpm -e sendmail
  * note end *
</verb>
</p>
<sect2>Install with source
<p>
  As of this writing Bruce Guenter has not released a tar.gz package of
  his patched qmail. So until Bruce does this, I am having you download the
  standard Qmail package, and forcing you to read the included INSTALL file.
<p>
  Installing the standard build may cause minor differnces in the config, one 
  example that comes to mind is that the init scripts are named differently.
  This should not cause too much confusion, I just want you to be aware.
<p>
  Run the following command
<verb>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
  cd <newly created dir>
  (Now read the INSTALL file and follow the steps to install Qmail)
</verb>
  -Example-
<code>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf qmail-1.03.tar.gz
  cd qmail-1.03
  vi INSTALL (Read and follow steps)
</code>
</p>
<sect1>Install Courier-imap
<sect2>Install with RPMS
<sect3>Compiling SRC.RPM's
<p>
  Build the courier-imap rpms from the tar file
  <tt>rpm -ta courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz</tt>

<verb>
  * note start *
  - This errors out if you compile as root, but if your not root you
  - wont have permissions to /usr/src/redhat. You will want to build as a 
  - non-root user, so create a ".rpmmacros" file (for rpm v3 and later) in 
  - your home directory containing the line "%_topdir /path/to/home/redhat".
  - Then create your own "redhat" directory containing all the subdirs that
  - /usr/src/redhat contains.
  - You should never build RPMs as root unless you have to.
  * note end *
</verb>

  * I will mention again, that I have built the binaries, and if you email me *
  * at dan@kuykendall.org, I will email them back to you. *

<sect3>Installing RPM's
<p>
  After compiling the source rpms, the binary will be located 
  in <tt>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/</tt> or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package
<verb>
  rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>
</verb>

  -Example-
<code>
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/courier-imap-0.31-1.i386.rpm
</code>

<sect2>Install with source
<p>
  Run the following command
<verb>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
  cd <newly created dir>
  ./configure
  make
  (As root)
  make install
</verb>

  -Example-
<code>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz
  cd courier-imap-0.31
  ./configure
  make
  (As root)
  make install
</code>
</p>

<sect1>Install VMailMgr
<p>
  At the time of this writing Bruce had not released a binary version of VMailMgr 
  that included Courier-imap support. This means until the next version of 
  VMailMgr is release, you will be required to build the RPMS yourself.
  
<sect2>Install with RPMS
<sect3>Compiling SRC.RPM's
<p>
  Now for the fun part, since VMailMgr needs the courier-imap sources during
  its compile to build the auth lib, I had to take the following steps.
  (please edit to suit your environment)

  1) copy the courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz to non-root users home dir

  <tt>cp courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz ~user1/ </tt>

  2) with my user account: untar, run config and make
<verb>
  su user1
  cd ~/
  tar zxf courier-imap-0.31.tar.gz
  cd courier-imap-0.31
  ./configure
  make
</verb>

  3) Install the VMailMgr sources and modify the spec file to support courier-imap
<verb>
  rpm -ivh VMailMgr-0.96.5-1.src.rpm
  edit /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/VMailMgr-0.96.5.spec
  on the ./configure line (line 49) add the following text to the end
  --with-courier-imap=/home/user1/courier-imap-0.31/
</verb>

  4) Compile VMailMgr based on the modified spec file
  <tt>rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/VMailMgr-0.96.5.spec</tt>

  * I will mention again, that I have built the binaries, and if you email me *
  * at dan@kuykendall.org, I will email them back to you. *

<sect3>Installing RPM's
<p>
  After compiling the source rpms, the binaries will be located 
  in <tt>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/</tt> or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package
<verb>
  rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>
</verb>
  -Example-
<code>
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/VMailMgr-0.96.5-1.i386.rpm
  rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/VMailMgr-daemon-0.96.5-1.i386.rpm
</code>

<sect2>Install with source
<p>
  Since VMailMgr needs the courier-imap sources during its compile to build the 
  auth lib, and since your using the compiling source, you will need to have kept
  your courier-imap sources from where you compiled it. If you deleted them, redo
  the steps up to the make command. 
<p>
  Run the following command
<verb>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
  cd <newly created dir>
  ./configure --with-courier-imap=<courier-imap sources>
  make
  (As root)
  make install
</verb>
  -Example-
<code>
  (As non-root user)
  tar zxf vmailmgr-0.96.5.tar.gz
  cd vmailmgr-0.96.5
  ./configure --with-courier-imap=/home/user1/courier-imap-0.31/
  make
  (As root)
  make install
</code>
  That should do it.

<p>
  You will need to add your domains to the /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains 
  file in the following format as is normal with qmail and VMailMgr.
<verb>
  domain1.com:user1
</verb>
  For more detailed setup and config documentation visit the Qmail website
  <url url="http://www.qmail.org"> and the VMailMgr website <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/VMailMgr/">
</p>
<sect1>Tell Qmail to use VMailMgr for authentication
<p>
  By default qmail uses checkpassword for authentication, to tell Qmail
  to use VMailMgr for authentication type the following command:
<verb>
  echo checkvpw > /var/qmail/control/checkpassword
</verb>

<sect1>Setup Courier-imap for VMailMgr
<p>
  Copy the VMailMgr auth libs to courier's directory

<verb>
  cp /usr/bin/authvmailmgr /usr/lib/courier-imap/libexec/authlib/
</verb>

  Edit <tt>/usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/imapd.config</tt>
  and add authvmailmgr as the first entry in AUTHMODULES
<p>
  For more detailed setup and config documentation visit the Courier-imap 
  website <url url="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/">
</p>
<sect1>Setup virtual domain with VMailMgr
<p>
  With the user account that will be managing the domain go to their home dir
  and type:
<verb>
  vsetup
</verb>

  This will setup the users home dir with the necessary structure to handle
  incoming email. You will probably want to create a email account by typing

<verb>
  vadduser emailuser
</verb>

  For more detailed setup and config documentation visit the VMailMgr 
  website <url url="http://em.ca/~bruceg/VMailMgr/">
</p>
<sect1>Starting the daemons
<p>
  Start Qmail daemons
<verb>
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmail start
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop3d start
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/smtp start
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmqpd start (optional)
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmtpd start (optional)
</verb>

  Start VMailMgr daemon
<verb>
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/vmailmgrd start
</verb>

  Start Courier-imap damon
<verb>
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/courier-imap start
</verb>
</p>
<sect1>Some considerations left
<p>
  Qmail and the Maildirs may cause some email apps that run locally to 
  not work. Visit the Qmail website <url url="http://www.qmail.org"> for details
  on email apps that have been patched to work with Maildirs.
<p>
  Courier-imap is not as widely used as Cyrus or UWash imap servers.
  As such, you may suffer from minor incompatibilities. Courier-imap is
  extremely well written, and tries to comply with the imap definition
  even if it means some imap clients wont work well. For details visit
  the Courier-imap website <url url="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/">.
</p>
<sect1>Known bugs
<p>
  None yet.
</p>
<sect1>The final word
<p>
  Im tired, and wonder if anyone will ever use this, but I'm happy its done.
  I'm sure if you have read this far your tired too. Well, all I can hope is
  that you have Qmail, VMailMgr and Courier-imap working. If so, Enjoy!
  If not, bummer!
<p>
  O.K. readers, you're done for today. Feel free to send me your
  feedback, eternal gratitude, flowers, ecash, cars, oil sources etc.
