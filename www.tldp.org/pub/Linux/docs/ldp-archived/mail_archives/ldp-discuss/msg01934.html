How Placing Your Customers First, Creates A 
Firestorm OF Big Profits and New Business!


Hi and welcome back to another exciting tip of the 
week.

Last week, I started on a method to increase the 
number of customers you can create with a referral 
system.

I ended the tip with the following statement.

It's all about them, not about you.

I say that because I want to introduce you to the 
enormous force and power you will harness when you 
realize how much more effective everything you do 
in your business will be when you start focusing 
all your thoughts and actions on what's going to be 
in the best interest of your customer and not 
yourself or your company.

You might already be doing that to some extent and 
if you are I commend you.

These marketing tips are designed to get you to a 
higher level, multiplying many times over the 
effectiveness, the profitability, and the impact of 
everything you do and everything you do from this 
day forward the moment you shift your focus and 
attention from yourself and your business to the 
needs and desires of your customers.

The referral system I use in my Nurses business, 
creates, on average, 10 new customers per week.

Referral systems are surprisingly easy to set up 
and require very little effort or time.

They represent the most immediate source of 
increased customers you have available in your 
business.

I want you to think of three things over this next 
week.

1.	Think of your customers as dear and valued 
friends.  Treat them with the respect and 
importance that you would have for any other 
friend.

2.	Revere the value, benefit and impact of what you 
do or what you sell, and how it has an affect on 
their life.

3.	Always hold yourself, your employees, and your 
business to the highest level of performance in 
behalf of your customers best interest.

You must understand, that if you think about the 
interest, needs, and well being of your customers, 
and a higher and more continuous level than anybody 
else in their lives, they are going to be at the 
top of their awareness, so that when they are with 
other people, when they are socializing, playing 
golf, or dinner with friends, that if the 
opportunity presents itself, if someone ever 
mentions or discusses any area where you can help 
them, your customers are automatically going to 
introduce your business to them.

And your customer can't help it.  Your business is 
constantly in their mind.

How can you accomplish this?

If your customer is into exercise, send them
Articles, books, or videos.

If they're interested in sports, send them anything 
you can find that is useful and valuable.

Think of other items that your customers are 
interested in and provide them with information 
that can help them.

The key to this whole process is not just going 
through the motions. 

It's being connected to your customer and sending 
them information that has genuine value constantly.

Most business owners don't realize that at the 
point of purchase, most customers are really 
excited and motivated.

At this point they really want to share this 
wonderful experience with friends and relatives.

I know of a photographer who after the photo 
session is completed, they are asked  for referrals 
of other people they know, who might also be 
interested and benefit by having a photo session 
for family pictures.

The incentive could be a lot of things,  he could 
give them additional prints.

He also will give the people they refer a 
substantial price advantage he does not offer to 
outside customers.

In this example, a great value is given to the 
referred customer, by the referring customer and 
trust me, it is genuinely appreciated by all the 
parties concerned.

A win, win situation for all.

Simple process.  All it takes is just a few words 
that you say at the point of purchase.

What could it be for your business?

The important point is that your business can 
utilize referral systems to immediately increase 
the number of customers and profit you do every day 
for the rest of your business life and it's so 
simple and easy and it costs you nothing more than 
a shift in your thinking and the words you say.

Well that's it for this week. Next week I'm going 
to cover the back end.  No. Not the back end your 
probably thinking about.  What I'm talking about is 
the back end sales and how to get more of them.

See you next week.
