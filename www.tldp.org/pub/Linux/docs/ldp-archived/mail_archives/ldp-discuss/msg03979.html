&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've been concerned about the way things are going and I would like to
&gt; &gt; add some comments for some feedback as to how things, strategically, can
&gt; &gt; be implemented to help with the LDP direction and to increase the
&gt; &gt; adoption and migration of Linux.  This is in no way a SPAM of LDP,
&gt; &gt; things can only go as far as 24/7 time can provide.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; [snip]
&gt; &gt; -------
&gt; &gt; Issue: HOWTO's and newsgroups diverge the solution process by making it
&gt; &gt; inefficient in finding answers.  Redundancy of answers to problems
&gt; &gt; across the newsgroups and web sites (linux.com, dejanews, linuxcare,
&gt; &gt; etc.) is an inefficient use of Linux users resources.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Issue: Because of this inefficiency, people don't want to fool with
&gt; &gt; Linux which reduces the adoption and migration rate of new users.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Solution:  Collaboration of either &quot;merging&quot; HOWTOs with newsgroups
&gt; &gt; &quot;style&quot; updates or using (maybe, but I'm not a technologist) an XML type
&gt; &gt; of data sharing between HOWTOs and newsgroups &quot;updates.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; What we need is more authors (and possibly co-authors) so they can
&gt; spend more time with newsgroups.  In some cases the conclusions
&gt; reached from newsgroup discussions need to be incorporated into a
&gt; howto.  Perhaps at the end of a discussion when a solution is found,
&gt; the final summary (if there is one or the last few posts if there
&gt; isn't) should be sent to the HOWTO maintainer.  This almost never
&gt; happens.

While I might agree that we might need more co-authors, but that's only
looking are part of the problem. If a system were designed whereby it
takes less time/energy to do the same thing, why not try a new system? 
While I agree that more people makes the load light, but if you improve
the system so that it takes less work, then more can get done.

&gt; 
&gt; The discussions may contain incorrect info., incomplete descriptions
&gt; of the problem, etc.  Furthermore to find out the outcome of a thread
&gt; one may need to spend a lot of time reading it, while a final
&gt; statement of what all the entire thread said would be much better.
&gt; But who's going to do this?  It's a lot of effort and requires good
&gt; knowledge of the topic.  In some cases someone asks a question in a

Again, if there was a way of making the answers less difficult to
determine and answer, then that's an improvement.  By designing a system
to narrow things down, you'll spend less time figuring things out and
more time fixing things.  Again, most may not want to agree to a new and
&quot;more&quot; complex system, but then again, we've not tried.

&gt; newsgroup but no one posts an answer.  Yet a search engine will find
&gt; this which is of no help except to make you feel better knowing that
&gt; someone else asked the same question you did but also couldn't get an
&gt; answer.
&gt; 
&gt; So discussions contain a lot of &quot;noise&quot; which needs to be filtered out.
&gt; But who is going to do this?  Possibly HOWTO authors if the had the
&gt; time.  Also, if a HOWTO author notices that someone is posting good
&gt; answers to a newsgroup, they might invite that person to become a
&gt; HOWTO author.

Again, true.  But to encourage new blood into the group, we need to show
that there is a benefit to involvement, both to the contributor AND the
community.  Making things easier is just one step in that direction.
