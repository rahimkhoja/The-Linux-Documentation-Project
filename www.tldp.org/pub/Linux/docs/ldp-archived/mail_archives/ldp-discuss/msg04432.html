ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY RIGHT NOW?<BR>

Don't laugh! Try this for a change while you wait for the others to<BR>
start working. One hour of work to get started and no mailing lists!<BR>

Here's How It Works<BR>
<BR>
Unlike many other programs, this three level program is more realistic<BR>
and much, much faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate for <BR>
this program is VERY HIGH AND VERY FAST, and you will see results in two <BR>
weeks or less! Just in time for next month's bills!<BR>
<BR>
You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other programs). <BR>
You should also send them to people who send you their programs <BR>
because they know these programs work and they are already believers<BR>
in the system!<BR>
<BR>
Besides, this program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER<BR>
RESPONSE RATE!<BR>
<BR>
Even if you are already in a program, stay with it, but do yourself a<BR>
favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and takes<BR>
a very small investment. It will pay off long before other letters even<BR>
begin to trickle in!<BR>
<BR>
Just give ONE person a $5 gift. That's all!<BR>
<BR>
Follow the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have<BR>
US$10,000 in your bank account! Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED, <BR>
and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! <BR>
Just one (1) US$5 bill. That's your investment!!!<BR>
<BR>
************************************************************************<BR>
<BR>
Follow These Simple Instructions<BR>
<BR>
1<B> ) On a blank sheet of paper write Please add me to your mailing<BR>
list. Write your name and address clearly and include your email <BR>
address for future mailings and courtesy follow ups. Fold it around <BR>
a US$5 and send it to the FIRST name on the list (#1).<BR>
<BR>
Only the first person on the list gets your name and a five dollar gift.<BR>
<BR>
2) Retype only the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE LIST. <BR>
Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD<BR>
(#3) position.<BR>
<BR>
3) </B>
<FONT size=3><B> Send out 20 copies of this letter. NOTE: by sending this letter<BR>
via EMAIL, the response time is much faster, and you save the expenses<BR>
of envelopes, stamps, and copying services</B>
<FONT size=3><B> . Consider this, MILLIONS<BR>
of people surf the internet everyday, all day, all over the world!<BR>
<BR>
Fifty thousand new people get on the internet every month! An<BR>
excellent source of names is the people who send you other programs<BR>
and the names listed on the letter they send you. Your contact source<BR>
is UNLIMITED!<BR>
<BR>
</B> It boggles my mind to think of all the possibilities! Mail, or should<BR>
I say Email, your letter TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of your time.<BR>
THAT'S IT!<BR>
<BR>
<B> To send your newsletter by Email:<BR>
<BR>
1) Go to "edit" and select all<BR>
2) Go to "edit" and "copy" <BR>
3) Start (compose) a new Email message <BR>
4) Address your Email and Subject blocks<BR>
5) </B>
<FONT size=3><B> Go to "edit" and "paste</B>
<FONT size=3><B> "<BR>
<BR>
</B> After you have pasted this article to your new Email, delete the old<BR>
header and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, Ect.) Now you can edit <BR>
the names and addresses with ease. I recommend deleting the top name, <BR>
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply<BR>
changing the numbers.<BR>
<BR>
<B> THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. </B> When your name reaches the first position<BR>
in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your gifts. The gifts <BR>
will be sent to you by 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself, who are<BR>
willing to invest US$5 and one hour to receive US$10,000 in cash.<BR>
<BR>
<B> That's all! There will be a total of US$10,000 in US$5 bills in your<BR>
mailbox in two weeks. US$10,000 for one hours work!<BR>
<BR>
</B> I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
<B> GO AHEAD--TRY IT. IT'S US $5 ! </B> EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4<BR>
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY!<BR>
<BR>
- - - - - - - - - TRUE STORY<BR>
Cindy Allen writes: I ran this gift summation four times last year. <BR>
The first time I received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks<BR>
and over $10,000 in cash in the next three times I ran it. I can't<BR>
begin to tell you how great it feels not to have to worry about money<BR>
anymore! I thank God for the day I received this letter! It has<BR>
truly changed my life! Don't be afraid to make gifts to <BR>
strangers--they'll come back to you in ten-fold. So, let's <BR>
keep it going and help each other out in these tough<BR>
and uncertain times.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
- - - - - - - - - CAN I DO IT AGAIN?<BR>
OF COURSE YOU CAN--this plan is structured for everyone to send only<BR>
20 letters each. However, you are certainly not limited to 20. <BR>
Mail out as many as you can. Every 20 letters you send has a return<BR>
of $10,000 or more. If you can mail forty, sixty, eighty, or<BR>
whatever, GO FOR IT!<BR>
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT.<BR>
<BR>
Each time you run this program, just follow steps 1 thru 3 and<BR>
everyone on your gift list benefits! Simple enough? You bet it is!<BR>
Besides, there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips<BR>
to the printer or copier, and you can do it again and again<BR>
with your regular groups or gifters, or start up a new group.<BR>
<BR>
Why not? It beats working! Each time you receive an MLM <BR>
offer, respond with this letter! <BR>
Your name will climb to the number one position at<BR>
dizzying rates.<BR>
<BR>
Follow the simple instructions, and above all<B> , PLEASE PLAY FAIR.<BR>
<BR>
</B> That's the key to this programs success. Your name must run the full<BR>
gamut on the list to produce the end results. Sneaking your name<BR>
higher up on the list WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it<BR>
only cheats the other people who have worked hard and have earned<BR>
the right to be there. So please, play by the rules and the $$$ will<BR>
come to you!<BR>
<BR>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY!- - - - -<BR>
- - <BR>
<BR>
$$$ Together we will prosper! $$$<BR>
<BR>
GOOD LUCK!!!<BR>
