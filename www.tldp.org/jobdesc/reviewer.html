    <h1>Document Reviewer</h1>

    <p>Reviewers maintain the quality of TLDP's HOWTOs and Guides.</p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>A document reviewer's responsibilities vary somewhat depending upon the
    type of review being conducted. There are both technical and language
    reviews. Technical reviewers are responsible for judging a document's
    technical accuracy. Language reviewers are responsible for proofreading
    documentation for proper spelling, grammar and continuity.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Participate in discussions on <a
      href="mailto:editors-subscribe@en.tldp.org.NOSPAM">TLDP's editors
      mailing list</a>.</li>

      <li>Serve as a point of contact between authors and TLDP during the
      review process.</li>

      <li>Check documents for accuracy and proper English language usage.</li>

      <li>Ensure errors and ommisions are corrected before documents are
      published.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Commitment</h2>

    <p>The amount of time needed to review a document depends upon its length,
    but generally reviewers spend between two and six hours on a document.
    Reviewers should also expect to spend an additional hour per document to
    verify changes were properly incorporated.</p>

    <h2>Qualifications</h2>

    <p>Technical reviewers must posses a good working knowledge of the HOWTO
    or Guide's subject. Language reviewers must have good English language and
    grammar skills.</p>

    <h2>Supervision</h2>

    <p>Reviewers work in concert with the review coordinator to determine work
    flow.</p>

    <h2>Training</h2>

    <p>All new authors are encouraged to read the
    <a href="../HOWTO/html_single/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/index.html">Reviewer-HOWTO</a>
    and to subscribe to <a
    href="mailto:editors-subscribe@en.tldp.org.NOSPAM">TLDP's editors mailing
    list</a>.</p>

    <h2>Policies Affecting Assignment</h2>

    <p>Reviewers should contact the <a
    href="mailto:editors-subscribe@en.tldp.org.NOSPAM">TLDP's editors mailing
    list</a> to announce their intentions prior to beginning a document
    review. This helps to avoid duplication of effort.</p>

    <h2>Benefits Of The Position</h2>

    <p>Becoming an reviewer gives volunteers the chance to learn about the
    topic under review as well as offering a way for non-programmers to
    contribute to the Linux community.</p>
