<p>From the feedback mailinglist: how about a Windows-Linux Analogy HOWTO? This would be a HOWTO describing what to do in order to run your favorite Microsoft Windows tasks and programs on a Linux
machine. If you ever had trouble migrating and you found solutions, then your input might be of great value! There is a resource at <a href="http://www.ndeepak.info/stuff/linux/linapps.php" target=
"_top">http://www.ndeepak.info/stuff/linux/linapps.php</a> that attempts at helping the users of MS Windows to make an easy transition from their OS to GNU/Linux.</p>

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN24"></a>1.3. Submitted for review</h2>
<p>It seems there is some confusion about this section. So, in order to make it extra clear for the reader:</p>
<p>The purpose of this section is to help authors gather feedback. Your constructive criticism is <em>very</em> welcome!</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="rss:item">Alex Weeks has taken it on him to update the <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/sag/index.html" target="_top">Linux System Administrator's Guide</a>. He's started cleaning out,
and already added a new part about NTP, the Network Time Protocol. The SAG was originally authored by some quite famous people, so we would like to wish Alex strength, patience and courage so as to
be a worthy successor. He might need your help, however, so please check out the current version and let Alex know what else you think is missing.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Werner Heuser submitted a <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:6396:200311:cancakbdomidilaanpca" target="_top">new edition of the Laptop HOWTO</a>. Since this
one, apart from laptops, also covers PDA and mobile telephone configuration topics - which presumably made it a lot longer, Werner would like to rename his document to be the <span class=
"QUOTE">"Linux Mobile Guide"</span>. Since these are big changes and since we are, after all, on the high of a re-styling wave, Tabatha subsequently suggested to give this new addition to our Guides
collection a <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:6397:200311:cancakbdomidilaanpca" target="_top">thorough review</a>. <a href=
"http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:6402:200311:cancakbdomidilaanpca" target="_top">Werner agreed</a>, so Tabatha is looking for a volunteer now. *hint* ;-)</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item"><a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:6407:200311:abimfngadhibogkclfmk" target="_top">And this post</a> proves that we can never have enough volunteers. Imagine
that you, like Lars Strand, ask for comments on your work. You've actively participated in other discussions, you are enthusiastic about being a first time author and all, but after some days it
proves that you get no reaction whatsoever. So we'd like to address a request to our dear readers: our authors do wish to to hear comments on their documents! Even if it's just a spelling correction,
they appreciate that, and will most likely personally tell you so. And then you will have an authentic E-mail, personally directed to you, from one of our authors! And you will be able to honestly
brag about your participation in an Open Source project ;-)</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Artemiy Pavlov submitted the first version of his <a href="http://linuxdoc.artemio.net/squashfs" target="_top">SquashFS HOWTO</a>. SquashFS is a file system for small Linux
implementations, which is for instance needed for embedded systems (on a computer chip) or on flash memory. SquashFS uses a strong compression mechanism that squeezes the last drop out of every
available bit. It is a read-only file system, so it's ideal for archiving purposes. If you want SquashFS support, you need a kernel patch and maybe the <b class="command">mksquashfs</b> command to
create these <span class="QUOTE">"squashed"</span> file systems.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Niko Sauer submitted the <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?5:mss:6441:200311:iddffjjonhgepdhbbfad" target="_top">USB Flash Memory HOWTO</a>, a new
document.</span></li>

<ul>
<li><span class="rss:item">Ian Ward found a small error having to do with the <b class="command">lpadmin</b> command (to administer printers), which he corrected in v1.3 of the <a href=

<li><span class="rss:item">David S.Lawyer's <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html" target="_top">Modem-HOWTO</a> has been updated to v0.31 with the sections on Mgetty dial-in and setserial
re-written.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Ari M&auml;kel&auml; submitted the v2.0.21 of his <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Finnish-HOWTO/" target="_top">Finnish HOWTO</a> with a lang="fi" attribute to the book

<p>Rahul Sundaram was <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:5619:200311:ihpahginmljdgbhooeje" target="_top">looking</a> into <a href=
"http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.html" target="_top">GNU FDL issues in Debian</a> and asked if OPL (Open Publication License <a href="http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml"
target="_top">http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml</a>) without any restrictions had any issues and what people think in general about documentation licenses. David Lawyer <a href=
"http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:5625:200311:claiepedajakajhoajgg" target="_top">said</a> that that LDP needs to create it's own license and prevent documentation abuse. Andy Oram <a href=
"http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:5637:200311:dokpachmpofmkohiengn" target="_top">suggested</a> that the LDP should contact the Creative Commons for help. Somewhere in the discussion, Colin
Watson <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:5689:200311:apcdgkbgafajaibhibkf" target="_top">explained</a> why Rodolfo J. Paiz's ideas of protection of documentation were not in the spirit
of freedom and how freedom applied to documentation just like it would apply to software.</p>
