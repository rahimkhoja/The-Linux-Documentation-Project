<ul>
<li><span class="rss:item">Matt Barnes would like to start a Linux Documentation - Audio Video project. The project aims to convert The LDP documents to wave and mp3 format. The goal of this exercise
is to show that it can be done, and that it should be done. The intent is to allow someone to download a media file into a media player and listen to the information rather than always having to read
it and possibly stream them over the internet. Contact Matthew S Barnes (mbarnes at bfinity dot net) if you have more ideas.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">iSCSI-Linux HOWTO: iSCSI is becoming more popular, particularly on Linux. Ben Rockwood was bothered by the massive lack of documentation available and wrote his own, titled
"A Quick Guide to iSCSI on Linux" (<a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/articles/iscsi/index.html" target="_top">http://www.cuddletech.com/articles/iscsi/index.html</a>). The document is currently
considered as the manual for the iSCSI Enterprise Target project (http://iscsitarget.sourceforge.net/) and is on of the popular guides to iSCSI on the net. Ben intends to update the document and
submit it to The LDP for inclusion as a HOWTO rather than maintain it on his own site as a paper.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Ben Rockwood noticed that the Benchmark HOWTO hasn't been updated since 1997. The unmaintained list shows a new maintainer for the doc, but an email to him got a failed
response from the mail server. Ben is of the opinion that the document could be a bit more heavy on disk subsystems. Currently the document is geared towards general systems performance. Ben was
wondering if he should start a new Disk-Benchmarking HOWTO and would like your input. Email benr@cuddletech.com</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">German SMIL tutorial on Linux: The Computing Center of the University of Kassel produced a SMIL introduction to Linux (around 4 hours of video, with subtitles in German and
some accompanying figures). Andreas Matthias wrote in to offer this to The LDP for integration into The LDP but did not find any support for non-textual formats in. The (not yet sufficiently polished
product) is at <a href="http://www.uni-kassel.de/hrz/anwendungen/matthias/unix-kurs/online" target="_top">http://www.uni-kassel.de/hrz/anwendungen/matthias/unix-kurs/online</a>. He was wondering if
someone who understands German and has some talent in laying out descriptive graphics would help them to complete the project. Please contact matthias@hrz.uni-kassel.de if you would like to offer
help.</span></li>
