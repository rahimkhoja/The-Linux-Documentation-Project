<P>
As a special exception, anthologies of LDP documents may include a
single copy of these license terms in a conspicuous location within the

to the single copy of the license without the document being considered
"modified" for the purposes of this section.

the same media shall not cause this license to apply to those other works.

All translations, derivative documents, or modified documents that
incorporate any LDP document may not have more restrictive license terms
than these, except that you may require distributors to make the resulting 
document available in source format.
