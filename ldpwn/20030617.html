<h1 class="sect1"><a name="AEN9"></a>1. History of The LDP</h1>
<p>let us see what we can find about 10 years of writing docs by volunteers.</p>
<p>As Matt Welsh, one of the co-founders, puts it: <span class="QUOTE">"The history of the LDP is a pretty murky memory these days."</span> It started in 1992, before the World Wide Web existed -
hard to imagine how we did without HTML, but in those days almost everything was FTP and Usenet, and dial-in to a BBS most likely. In the beginning, most of the documentation was in one big file,
split up in sections, called the <em>Linux FAQ</em>. But as Linux capabilities grew, it was no longer possible for one person to maintain it, and pretty soon not even for several people to manage the
job. Thus the HOWTOs were born, each describing a part of the original big chunk of information, an easily extendible system that allowed for many authors to contribute their part in their area of
specialization.</p>
<p>That effort lead to the use of SGML, allowing for fast generation of all sorts of output formats, including HTML, from one source file or set of files. The first tests were conducted at Sunsite (a
famous server machine at the University of North Carolina), which was the first web site offering information about Linux. Also when you wanted to download Linux software, sunsite.unc.edu was the
place to go. It still contains some kernel archives - probably by accident, there are also a lot of empty directories these days.</p>
<p>Before the crash last month I was able to find, via FTP, a document referring to two maintainers of the LDP as it was ran by the end of 1994 at UNC. It pointed to Jon Magid and a mysterious Erik
with no last name, who was still at Sunsite in 1996. Will his last name be revealed in the next edition? Check it out next week!</p>

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN66"></a>4.2. Updating LDP XSLT stylesheets</h2>
<p>Dan York sent in a message to the <tt class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:docbook@en.tldp.org">docbook@en.tldp.org</a>&gt;</tt> list <a href=
"http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?2:mss:407:200306:cocahfbmmomdmigpcjgm" target="_top">inviting volunteers</a> for testing and updating the LDP XSLT stylesheets with the latest version (1.16.2) of the
DocBook stylesheets. The LDP stylesheets are based on version 1.44, which apparently do not work, because, the way documentation in the standard stylesheets is done has changed. If you are interested
in doing this, you might like to help David Horton who has <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?2:mss:423:200306:mllcepbomdkmklcadjai" target="_top">volunteered</a> to do this.</p>

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN72"></a>4.3. HTML to DocBook equivalents</h2>
<p>If you have just started using DocBook and you are looking for DocBook equivalents of HTML tags, Martin A. Brown's <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?2:mss:409:200306:ojenlikbehfnljafjfmh"
target="_top">short help with examples</a> should be useful. The DocBook tags are of-course available from <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/documentation/reference/html/docbook.html"

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="AEN77"></a>4.4. Update on Lampadas</h2>
<p>David Merrill <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4581:200306:pdldkklajacikgojadpf" target="_top">sent in a mail</a> inviting an IRC discussion on <a href="http://www.lampadas.org/"
target="_top">Lampadas</a> for discussing (1) <a href="http://www.plone.org/" target="_top">Plone</a> work, (2) a possible resurrection of the old Lampadas mod_python code but with a much more
limited scope and (3) any other concerns you have. David Lawyer <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4590:200306:claiepedajakajhoajgg" target="_top">was of the opinion</a> that new
volunteers could be of help with Lampadas provided they done some programming in the past. Elsewhere, to David Merrill's comment that he would like to modify the CMF to use a plugin system for raw
content, Nicolas Chauvat <a href="http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4595:200306:nibfaikpkkpacdojonbm" target="_top">said</a> that David Merrill should not try doing it on his own but needs
co-ordination, because, plone has OpenOffice support and was progressing at a very fast pace.</p>
