<ul>
<li><span class="rss:item">Gareth Anderson would like to include the GNU Linux Command Line Tools Summary document http://www.karakas-online.de/gnu-linux-tools-summary/introduction.html which he has
been working on since more than two years, in The LDP collection.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Coert wrote a Secure Internet for Small Office / Home Office HOWTO. A draft version of the document is available at http://www.cybcon.com/~coert/linux/siso/index.html. The
HOWTO describes how to bring up your own Firewall, Wireless Access Point and VPN Server on a single board computer. It currently uses the Geode SC1100 and Atheros WiFi NIC, but could easily be
extended to include other hardware, drivers and services.</span></li>
<li><span class="rss:item">Zouhir Hafidi wrote a HOWTO about setting up Linux and Windows Terminal Services in Schools and would like to submit it to TLDP. A draft version of the document is
available from http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~hafidi/terminal-services/ and your comments are most welcome.</span></li>

<h1 class="sect1"><a name="new-proposed"></a>2. New document proposals</h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="rss:item">lists@mjhall.org proposed to write a Computational Linguistics HOWTO. This HOWTO would briefly survey the major branches of contemporary computational linguistics and the
major types of linguistics software, and then catalogue Linux software available in each category. An extensive bibliography and list of resources such as websites and mailing lists would also
included. Some general advice would also be offered on system configuration for linguistics work. Martin Wheeler and Rahul Sundaram were excited about the idea.</span></li>

<ul>
<li><span class="rss:item">Modifiability of documentation and software<br></span>
<p><span class="rss:item">In a discussion thread concerning modifiability of documentation and data, Rahul Sundaram commented that most people don't care about whether the source code is modifiable
but that, that doesn't mean we say we don't care about Free or open source software. David Lawyer responded indicating that there is a difference between software and documents. David said
<span class="QUOTE">"Software needs to be free since it's relatively hard to write it and much of it is reusable. But for documentation, the situation is a lot different. I've looked at a few of our
old documents that are out-of-date and they mostly need to be entirely rewritten. This can be done even if the doc doesn't allow modification. Why? Because one uses the info in the obsolete doc plus
information in other docs to write a new doc. Facts are not copyrighted."</span> David was in favour of modifiable documents, but not as strongly as Rahul was. An interesting discussion
ensued.</span></p>
