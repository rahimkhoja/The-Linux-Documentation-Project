>The best way to explain the need for these best practices is by
putting together an example of a real world project scenario and show how
exactly will these best practices fit into the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bigger
picture"</SPAN
>.  Also, a lot of readers have told me that the sections on
<A
HREF="section1-branchmerge.html"
>Branching and Merging</A
> 
and <A
HREF="section1-chgpropagation.html"
>Change Propagation</A
> will require examples for better
explanation. Listening to the readers is a Good Thing so I have 
put together a particular project scenario and then create a series of
events to show how the best practices, if followed, would help is making
operations smoother.  </P

>Consider a software project where version 1.0 has just been put into
production and everyone is done celebrating.  The next step is to start
working on the new features of the subsequent release.  Also, the users of
the system have started to use it full-time and bug reports of various
levels have started to come in.  </P
><P
> Before jumping into new enhancements or bug fixes, the best practices
	for <A
HREF="section1-branchmerge.html"
>Branching and Merging</A
> should be followed.  Few of
	the important practices are <A
HREF="section1-branchmerge.html#section2-tagrelease"
>Tag each release</A
> and
	<A
HREF="section1-branchmerge.html#section2-branchatrelease"
>Create a branch after each release</A
>. These practices will
	effectively established two <SPAN

	one for regular enhancements and the other for bug fixes and minor
	enhancements on the last release.</P

>10.2. Development and Delivery</H2
><P
>Now, we are ready for business.  Let us examine the bug fixes and
enhancements track.  Assume that there are three bugs of which two are of a
high priority that should be fixed right away (possibly within a week) and the
third can be delivered after some time (say after 4 weeks).  In the
middle of this schedule there is a regular release scheduled in three weeks.
Considering that we have a busy month ahead, let us see how exactly we can
use the Best practices to ease the days ahead.</P
