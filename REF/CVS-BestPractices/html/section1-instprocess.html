>9.1. Implement Change Management Process</H2
><P
>All organizations must implement a good Change management process
(<SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>CMP</SPAN
>).  A good CMP will define how changes are received, 
recorded, tracked, executed and delivered.  CVS provides version
control for your project.  Change management addresses the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bigger
picture"</SPAN
> of how enhancements and bugs are received, tracked and
closed.  CVS will play a smaller but a very important part in this
entire picture.  With a formal change management process in place in the
organization, tools such as CVS will be looked at as aiding this process
instead of acting as a general development overhead.  </P
><P
>Change management is quite a vast topic that cannot be done justice
here.  Please look up other sources of information on change management.  </P

>9.2. Make CVS Usage part of Objectives</H2
><P
>To institutionalize CVS, it can be made as part of the performance
objectives for the developer to use CVS in the project.  In addition, it
can also be made as part of the objective for the project manager to deploy
CVS in his or her project.  </P
><P
>Compliance of this can then be reviewed as part of the appraisal cycle
for the employee.  </P

><P
>CVS usage metrics can be collected in terms of percentage of
deployment in the organization,  project size handled etc., This information
will spur other line managers and program managers to look at CVS as a
tool that will aid them in their daily operations.  </P
