>&#13;            The <EM
>root</EM
> account is the most privileged account on a Unix system. The <EM
>root</EM
> account has no security restrictions imposed upon it. This means the 
            system assumes you know what you are doing, and will do exactly what you request -- <EM
>no questions asked</EM
>. Therefore it is easy, with a mistyped command, to wipe out crucial system files. When 
            using this account it is important to be as careful as possible. For security reasons, never log in on your server as <EM
>root</EM
> unless it is absolutely an instance that 
            necessitates root access. Also, if you are not on your server, never sign in and leave yourself on as <EM
>root</EM
> <EM
>--this is Very, Very, Very BAD practice</EM
>.

>&#13;            <EM
>Set login time out for the root account</EM
>. Despite the notice to never, if they are not on the server sign in as <EM
>root</EM
> and leave it unattended, administrators 
            still stay on as <EM
>root</EM
> or forget to logout after finishing their work and leave their terminals unattended. The answer to solve this problem is to make the bash shell automatically 
            logout after not being used for a period of time. To do that, you must set the special variable of Linux named <TT
CLASS="envar"
>TMOUT</TT
> to the time in seconds of no input before logout.
            Edit your profile file <TT
CLASS="filename"
> /etc/profile</TT
> and add the following line somewhere after the line that read <TT
CLASS="envar"
>HISTFILESIZE=</TT
> on this file:

CLASS="screen"
>&#13;            TMOUT=7200
            </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
            The value we enter for the variable <TT
CLASS="envar"
>TMOUT=</TT
> is in second and represent 2 hours (60 * 60 = 3600 * 2 = 7200 seconds). It is important to note that if you decide to put the above line 
            in your <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/profile</TT
> file, then the automatic logout after two hours of inactivity will apply for all users on the system. So, instead, if your prefer to control which users will be automatically 
            logged out and which ones not, you can set this variable in their individual <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.bashrc</TT
>  file.
            After this parameter has been set on your system, you must logout and login again as root for the change to take effect.
