>In television and radio news shows, news editors, some
  reporters, and even anchors have input on the news to be aired.
  In other types of shows, often the producer decides which stories
  to cover in future broadcasts. Segment producers will produce the
  individual stories for a broadcast, while assistant producers may
  perform specialized functions, such as finding interview
  subjects.</P

><P
>The same considerations of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"newsworthiness"</SPAN
> discussed for
  newspapers apply to television broadcast news, with the added
  element of visuals. There are several types of TV programming you
  will want to consider. These include educational and
  informational programs, local and community news programs, and
  perhaps a business program. Understand the types of shows being
  produced and aired in your regional area, and then pitch your
  story for an in-studio interview or a feature.</P

>Ensuring that you are pitching the right story to the right
  TV program staffer will be discussed later in this guide.</P

><P
>Radio time for news stories is very limited. Usually there
  is only enough time for headlines and summaries of the
  day's top stories, but radio still has great
  opportunities for your organization.</P
><P
>Some radio stations offer expanded news coverage and
  features (this is sometimes called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"foreground
  programming"</SPAN
>). Most Linux news has a better chance of
  getting coverage or an interview in news programming than in
  regular programming. The best chance of all lies in targeting an
  all-news station. Approximately 45 minutes of each hour are
  devoted to news, sports, weather, special reports, and features.
  (The remaining 15 minutes are for commercials.) All-news radio
  stations operate more like a magazine or newspaper, with specific
  departments and editors, more producers, more reporters, and
  therefore, more available resources. Stories that interest a
  significant portion of their listening community or that appeal
  to deep-pocketed sponsors will be given the most attention. You
  could pitch a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Linux for business"</SPAN
>
  type of story. Even if your underlying goal is to promote your
  organization, the story or interview must avoid advertising or
  commercial overtones of any kind. Nothing kills the news
  media's credibility faster or turns off
  listeners more than inappropriate jingoism.</P

>4.2.3. Talk Shows</H2
><P
>Talk shows, whether on television or radio, are excellent
  vehicles for covering a wide variety of topics. Talk shows often
  invite industry experts to be commentators or participants in a
  panel discussion. In addition, these shows often have phone-in
  segments, inviting listeners to ask questions or make comments.
  These characteristics make the talk show an ideal forum for
  raising your organization's visibility.</P
><P
>For these programs, there is usually an assistant producer
  responsible for lining up interesting guests, as well as a
  producer who coordinates the overall process. Both email and
  telephone contact with the assistant producer can prove
  rewarding. The host, interviewer, or moderator of the show does
  not usually choose the guests or have final say in who appears.
  Unless instructed otherwise, contacting the assistant producer or
  producer is best.</P
