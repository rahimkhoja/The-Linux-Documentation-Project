>2.2. Who Needs to Know About Your Organization?</H1
><P
>Now that you know what you want to do, the second step is
  to determine who you need to talk to.</P
><P
>The best way to gain insight into this question is to look
  from the other side of the communications channel: Of all the
  people that your organization deals with, who do you need to tell
  about new programs and products? Often your most important
  contacts will be your current and future partners, IT
  professionals in your local area, human resource managers,
  training and development personnel, and organizations offering
  competing products.</P
><P
>To reach your organization's public
  relations goals, there are many key audiences and stakeholders
  that your organization should regularly communicate with to gain
  higher visibility. The following list details a few of the most
  important audiences:</P
