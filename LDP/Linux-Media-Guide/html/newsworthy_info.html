      This kind of news is obvious. For instance, a new branch of
      your organization may have just opened, and you want to make
      people aware of the new location and offerings. Also, if you
      are launching a new product or have hired a local figure
      well-known to the Linux community, these things are of great
      interest to the public.</P

      Sometimes newsworthy information is a little less obvious.
      Every day happenings can be in the news. Whenever there are
      changes or new developments in the industry, this clearly
      presents an opportunity for positive exposure and media
      coverage in appropriate publications. For instance, how and
      why the change is being undertaken may become a story in
      itself. Perhaps the change is being driven by a dynamic Linux
      guru, worthy of a magazine profile. Sometimes these stories
      are called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"case studies"</SPAN
> and
      typically are given favourable consideration by editors
      because of their considerable human interest appeal.</P

      Society is fascinated with numbers. The more impressive or
      interesting the figures (relative to competitors and the rest
      of the industry), the more likely media outlets are to use
      those numbers in their reporting.

      Notable changes in staff or volunteers are another way of
      getting media exposure. The more important the position, the
      more newsworthy organizational announcements become.</P

>&#13;      <EM
>Partnerships.</EM

      Especially partnerships with far-reaching effects across the
      industry create a major news story.</P

      When your organization wins an award or is recognized by
      peers, let the world know!</P

>The bottom line is that you can find news in almost any
  event. Your responsibility is to ensure that your organization
  becomes known and respected by editors, journalists, educators,
  and other stakeholders with whom you are communicating. Remember,
  the more respected your organization is, the more (and better)
  coverage you are likely to receive. The determining factor in
  that judgment will be the audience&#8212;the
  readers, viewers, and listeners who you reach.</P
