>5.2. What Makes a News Release Good (or Bad)</H1
><P
>Print editors and journalists are notoriously overworked
  and underpaid. A well-written news release will often be used
  word for word, with maybe a few changes for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"objectivity"</SPAN
> or 
  to accommodate the publication's format.</P
><P
>The editorial staff at the <EM
>Los Angeles Times</EM
>
  says this about news releases:</P
><P
>A good news release is a concise, complete description of
  an upcoming event; a timely report of an event has just occurred;
  notification of important personnel or procedural changes in an
  organization; or other news or feature tips.</P
><P
>Bad releases&#8212;the ones that don't get used&#8212; often have
  these common mistakes:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Lack of a local angle.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Insufficient or inaccurate information (who, what,
       when, where, why, how).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Failure to include contact information for the
       organization.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Verbosity. (Try to keep the release to one or two
       pages, but balance brevity against failure to include
       necessary information.)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Lack of timeliness&#8212;the
       editor's deadline has passed or the news
       is released too long after the event.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Writing a news release does not have to be painful. What
  you need is a little time to gather all the facts: the who, what,
  when, where, why and how (and any additional information
  necessary to support).</P
><P
>Sometimes your news won't be used right
  away or in the form you provided. A writer may need time to
  rewrite your outline into a news story. Or, if a feature is being
  developed on Linux, the writer may use many sources for depth and
  objectivity. They may use quotable quotes, first-person
  anecdotes, statistics, and causes and effects from your releases
  as well as those of your competitors.</P
><P
>Deadlines are hugely important because the news media
  cannot delay publication or broadcasting.
  Don't bother editors with untimely
  information. If you can't pitch your story in
  time, wait for another opportune moment to come around.</P
