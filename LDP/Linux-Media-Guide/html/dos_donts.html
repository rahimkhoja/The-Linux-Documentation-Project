  fundamental do's and don'ts that you as a public relations

><EM
>Do</EM
> introduce yourself to different media 
  editors, journalists, and freelancers by sending them an email note or by 
  inviting them out for coffee or lunch. Bring along some background information 
  or a few pages from your website to explain what your organization is
  all about.</P
><P
><EM
>Do</EM
>
  follow up after the meeting with thank-you note, mentioning that
  you will be in touch as appropriate. This is important to set the
  stage for future dialogue.</P
><P
><EM
>Do</EM
>
  let them know what your goals are and what special events, news,
  or programs you have coming up.</P
><P
><EM
>Do</EM
> 
  send out news releases by email about two weeks in advance, when
  you have a special event planned. Send a follow-up email a few
  days later. Phone again at a convenient time before the event to
  suggest a possible meeting or interview at the event. The bigger
  the event, the more advance notice should be given.</P
><P
><EM
>Do</EM
>  
  tailor your pitch for the needs of each medium. For example, set
  up plenty of photo opportunities for television media,
  human-interest stories for print, and interviews for
  radio.</P
><P
><EM
>Do</EM
>
  give them the name of someone who has a personal experience to
  tell. Remember that the media loves a good story. Real life
  stories engage readers and makes for better copy than just
  statistics relating to Linux and open source.</P
><P
><EM
>Do</EM
>
  ensure that you or your designated spokesperson is available for
  interviews at a moment's notice; otherwise
  much of your efforts will be in vain. Both of you, of course,
  should do your homework and rehearse questions and answers in
  advance. You should have facts, statistics, and anecdotes in your
  head, ready to use.</P

>4.4.2. Don'ts</H2
><P
><EM
>Don't</EM
>
  send out a pitch or news release with vague, general statements.
  Your story has to show not tell, and you must convince the editor
  to cover the news that promotes your organization rather someone
  else's. Getting editorial coverage is fiercely competitive.</P
><P
><EM
>Don't</EM
>
  ever tell the media what you want from them. Instead, ask them
  about the kinds of stories they're looking
  for, or if there are any other reporters in their newsroom who
  would be interested in Linux and open source. By learning what
  they want, you can tailor your communications to get what 
  <EM
>you</EM
> want.</P
><P
><EM
>Don't</EM
>
  underestimate the importance of less prominent media like
  community newspapers, cable TV, trade journals, and
  special-interest newsletters. Look at the entire spectrum of news
  media for different angles.</P
