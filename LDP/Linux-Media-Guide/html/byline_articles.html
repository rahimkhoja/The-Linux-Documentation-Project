><P
>A byline is the line showing the
  author's name at the beginning of an article.
  Basically, a bylined article is attributed to a source rather
  than being anonymous.</P
><P
>Bylined articles can be any length, and they tend to based
  on opinion. They articulate views and opinions that are clearly
  the writer's own, without requiring objectivity.</P
><P
>Issues, trends, and predictions regarding Linux and open
  source are ideal subjects for bylined articles. Moreover,
  forward-looking pieces are of high interest. Editors are always
  looking for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the next thing"</SPAN
> to tell their readers about.</P
><P
>Opinion articles are important to position your
  organization as the leader and trendsetter in your field. To be a
  guru is to be watched, quoted, respected, and followed. Editors
  like highlighting celebrated members of the community because
  they sell more issues.</P
><P
>Gauging the interest of the news media is very important.
  What's hot? What are they writing about? Check
  the topics listed in their editorial calendars. Try to match
  their interests to the activities of your organization in the
  community. Then start writing your opinion piece.</P
><P
>Typically, the author of a bylined article should be your
  organization's designated spokesperson and
  acknowledged authority for the media. That might be you or a
  senior official. Sometimes a public relations professional will
  ghost-write the piece for the spokesperson, whose name will
  appear on the article. When this occurs, the article must closely
  reflect the spokesperson's views and ideas. In
  other words, he or she <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"owns"</SPAN
> the
  ideas expressed in the article, not the writer.</P
><P
>An added bonus of by-lined articles is that they can be
  adapted into speeches for possible speaking opportunities.
  Conversely, any speech can be written as a by-lined
  article.</P
