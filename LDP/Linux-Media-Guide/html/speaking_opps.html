>7.1. Arranging Speaking Opportunities</H1
><P
>Arranging possible speaking opportunities takes
  considerable effort and involves a long lead time. In most
  instances, you must be in contact with the conference organizers
  at least nine to ten months in advance of the show. You may even
  find that a sponsorship is required to be considered as a
  possible presenter.</P
><P
>First, do your research regarding relevant conferences that
  are being planned in your area in the months ahead. The website
  of the event organizer or of the conference itself is often a
  good place to start looking for information. Contact the
  organizers to find out their needs and application requirements
  for possible speakers.</P
><P
>Also, consider other venues in addition to trade shows
  focusing on Linux and open source. For example, you could offer
  your services as a speaker to human resources or computer
  training communities.</P
><P
>The key to successful participation is similar to pitching
  to the news media. You must understand your audience, you must
  have a compelling topic, and you must be ready and willing to
  impart your knowledge and experience of the industry. Most
  importantly, your presentation has to teach something to someone,
  and not just be a commercial for your organization or Linux. Give
  the audience the satisfaction of having really learned something
  from your presentation, and show organizers will want to have you
  as a presenter at their next show.</P
