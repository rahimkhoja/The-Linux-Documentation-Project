>5.3. Top Ten Tips for Writing Releases</H1
><P
>To summarize what we have said so far, here are ten tips
  for writing an excellent news release.</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
><EM
>Use an active headline to grab the
      editor's attention.</EM
></P
><P
>The headline makes your release stand out. Keep the
  headline short, active, and descriptive, with the most positive
  spin. Write <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Jane Doe Named Person of the
  Year"</SPAN
> instead of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Jane Doe Gets
  Award."</SPAN
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Put the most important information at the
      beginning.</EM
></P
><P
>This is a tried and true rule of journalism. Remember that
  the first two paragraphs should contain the salient facts of who,
  what, when, where, why, and how. Don't bury
  good information at the end.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Avoid exaggeration and unsubstantiated claims.</EM
></P
><P
>A news editor can smell a sales pitch a mile away. Instead
  of making over-inflated statements, provide real, usable
  information. Find legitimate ways to set your organization apart,
  and stress those points.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Write in an active, engaging, and concise style.</EM
></P
><P
>Use language that conveys your excitement about the news.
  If your release is boring or passively written, the editor may
  conclude the news itself is not very meaningful or you are not a
  good candidate for an interview. Interesting equals
  newsworthy.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Keep your release to two pages or less.</EM
></P
><P
>Generally, if you can't state your
  message in two pages, you are not getting to the point fast
  enough. Editors are always looking for concise, easy-to-read
  releases that can be thrown onto a website or squeezed into a
  leftover space in a page layout. For highly important news with
  many details, you can include a third page, but this should be
  done sparingly.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Include a contact.</EM
></P
><P
><EM
>Every</EM
>
  news release should include a contact person who the media can
  reach for more information. This contact is your spokesperson and
  must be familiar with all the news in the release. They should be
  prepared to answer questions.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Keep jargon to the minimum.</EM
></P
><P
>Avoid using highly technical terms and buzzwords familiar
  only to Linux insiders. Jargon can date quickly, and complicated
  language irritates people who don't know what
  you mean. Your goal is to tell your story to as wide an audience
  as possible, not to unduly limit the audience. Even
  special-interest publications mostly write in plain language and
  only use jargon and acronyms generally familiar to their
  readers.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Stress <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"benefits, benefits,
      benefits."</SPAN
></EM
></P
><P
>This falls under the category of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"show,
  don't tell."</SPAN
> Avoid claiming something is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"unique"</SPAN
> or
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"the best"</SPAN
> when you can't substantiate this. Instead, provide
  specific examples of benefits, supported by evidence and anecdotes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Be specific and detailed.</EM
></P
><P
>Marcia Yudkin, author of 
  <EM
>Six Steps to Free Publicity,</EM
>
  talks about the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Yes, but what <EM
>is</EM
>
  it?"</SPAN
> syndrome. Nothing is more irritating than seeing
  constant references to a product name or service name, but no
  information on what that product or service is. The reader needs
  to be able to visualize a new product or understand what a
  service offers. This is particularly critical for launches
  (announcements of new offerings). You should ask someone
  unfamiliar with your product or service to read your release and
  then describe the product or service in their own words.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Proofread!</EM
></P
><P
>This is easily forgotten, but extremely important. Always
  proofread your work before issuing the final release. Better yet,
  give the document to someone else (perhaps a copy editor) who can
  readily spot spelling and grammatical errors. Nothing signals
  unprofessionalism more than a typo-filled communication.</P
