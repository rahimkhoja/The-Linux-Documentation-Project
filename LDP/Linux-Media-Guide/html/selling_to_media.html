><P
>Clearly, editors and producers have to know the interests
  of their audiences. Often this knowledge comes from the
  editors' strong identification with their
  readers, which can develop into an almost paternal attitude.
  Editors are constantly making decisions about what their readers
  will and won't see&#8212;any
  editor would correctly say that is their job. Part of this
  judgment is based on what the editor feels the readers are
  currently interested in, and part is based on what the editor
  feels the readers <EM
>should</EM
> or <EM
>will</EM
>
  be interested in. An astute editor keeps their sights as much on
  the future as on the present.</P
><P
>Keep in mind that the role of the news media has never been
  confined to just reporting the news, but also includes analysis
  and interpretation. Analysis and interpretation are considered
  the domain of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"experts,"</SPAN
> which
  presents a perfect opportunity for specialists in your
  organization to share their knowledge and bring visibility to
  your organization.</P
><P
>Editors, being journalists, abide by the five Ws tradition
  of reporting: who, what, where, when, and why (with an unofficial
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"how"</SPAN
>tagging along).
  Always include clear, engaging answers to the five Ws in all news
  releases. Also, you can use the five Ws as a guideline for how to
  most effectively catch the attention of editors.</P
><P
><EM
>The way</EM
> in which you present this information 
  is crucial to being accepted by an editor as newsworthy for their audience. 
  You have to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"tell a story,"</SPAN
> make the news
  interesting and relevant, and choose an appropriate time and
  place to present the story.</P
><DIV
CLASS="section"
><H2
CLASS="section"
><A
NAME="selling_who"
></A
>4.3.1. Who</H2
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Who"</SPAN
> usually consists of your
  organization, spokespersons, and authorities quoted in your news
  releases. Your organization and those speaking as representatives
  must be presented as professional, authoritative, influential,
  and with strong credentials for speaking on matters related to
  your industry. By positioning your organization in this way, you
  have a much better chance of generating visibility and
  prestige.</P
><P
>The goal is to make your organization a recognized
  authority in your field. With this distinction, any time you
  issue a statement, your news will draw the attention of editors
  whose readers are interested in the specific work you do. All
  things being equal, the more influential your spokesperson, the
  better the chance your news has of being selected.</P

>4.3.2. What</H2
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"what"</SPAN
> is the subject of
  your release&#8212;a new application, a new
  appointment, or any interesting event you choose to announce.
  Naturally, unusual or exciting announcements have a better chance
  of being covered. Anything you can do to make your story stand
  out from the ordinary will be viewed as a refreshing change and
  will increase the chance of your story being published.</P
><P
>If the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"what"</SPAN
> in your story
  is a personnel appointment (either paid or volunteer), look for
  some human interest in either the person or the job at hand. If
  this person is a well-known Linux expert or a pillar of their
  local community, all the better. The more noteworthy the
  individual, the more newsworthy the story.</P
><P
>If the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"what"</SPAN
> is an event
  such as a Linux trade show, that is a plus. Editors regard events
  as more urgent and newsworthy than other announcements.</P

NAME="selling_where"

>4.3.3. Where</H2
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"where"</SPAN
> of your release
  plays a key role. As you begin to understand public relations,
  you will appreciate the role of staging events to generate news.
  Since the media appreciates visuals, try to produce events with
  images as well as a pertinent story.</P
><P
>In planning a pitch or a release, ensure that you clearly
  indicate the address of every event you hope to have reporters
  attend. Reporters' time is wasted if they have
  to call for directions to every event. A special media contact
  person is a good idea to have at all events. This person can
  prevent reporters from missing important or visual parts of
  events. Be aware of upcoming events or activities that you might
  be able to capitalize on or borrow interest from. Again, the goal
  is promote the unusual, the unique, the unexpected that will
  pique the editor's curiosity or sense of
  humor&#8212;and get your story into print.</P

NAME="selling_when"
></A
>4.3.4. When</H2
><P
>Remember that for most organizations,
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"when"</SPAN
> can be just about any time.
  There is no need to wait for once-a-year events (like trade
  shows) to provide news. With creative thinking, you can come up
  with news stories that capitalize on current events. For example,
  news about the economy and what proprietary operating systems
  cost organizations to run can provide a background for Linux
  news. New computer applications running on Linux also present
  rich opportunities.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"When"</SPAN
> is extremely important
  in terms of releasing the news. For instance, if you are
  publicizing special events or trade show appearances, you want to
  allow ample time for an editor to assign a reporter to cover the
  story (if the news is deemed of interest). If the editor
  doesn't have enough time to assign a reporter
  to cover your event, you can count on no reporters being
  available.</P
><P
>Fortunately, though, while timing is critically important,
  avoiding bad timing is easy. The first rule is always to provide
  a reasonable amount of advance notice. For news-breaking media
  such as radio, television, and some newspapers, two days is an
  absolute minimum, and a week is more prudent. For magazines and
  trade journals, one to two weeks is the minimum in most cases,
  and three to four weeks is even better.</P
><P
>The second rule is to use your common sense and avoid
  scheduling pitches when you know the editor is on deadline or is
  involved with other events. Also avoid periods when the editor is
  working with little or no support staff (such as when reporters
  are away at an important trade show). Generally, business hours
  between 9:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. is best, since this gives
  reporters time to write and file their stories. Mondays and
  Fridays are always more difficult than midweek, but
  don't be afraid to ask if the editor prefers
  specific days.</P
><P
>If you are requesting reporters attend and cover an event,
  never ask the editor to confirm their attendance. The editor will
  not appreciate the pressure, and besides they cannot guarantee
  they will have the resources (reporters and camera operators) at
  the appointed time. News changes by the second. A reporter may be
  ready to go to your event and, at the last minute, be reassigned
  to something else. This happens all the time, so
  don't take the rejection personally.</P
><P
>If you show respect for the editor's
  time, they will appreciate your consideration and may be more
  likely to cover at least some of your stories.</P

>4.3.5. Why</H2
><P
>So far, we have discussed <EM
>who</EM
>
  the news media is interested in, <EM
>what</EM
>
  news is most likely to be covered, and <EM
>where</EM
>
  and <EM
>when</EM
> you are going to make your pitch. 
  Now, in looking at the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"why"</SPAN
> of your
  organization's story, we will address two questions. First, 
  <EM
>why</EM
> did your news item come to pass, and second, 
  <EM
>why</EM
> should an editor (and their readers, listeners, 
  or viewers) find your event newsworthy?</P
><P
>Unless there is something terribly interesting about the
  who, what, where, or when, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"why"</SPAN
> is
  the single most compelling factor available to an editor in
  determining newsworthiness. Why is the news important to the
  audience? Why do they need to know about this? Why is your
  particular event unusual or out of the ordinary?</P
><P
>Most organization's activities can be
  analyzed in terms of their cause and/or their effect. The more
  you can identify causes or effects in your story, the better
  chance your organization has of receiving coverage. As an
  example, if there is a trend of Linux being increasingly used in
  the enterprise, there must be a reason why. Giving the editor
  just a few of these reasons can make your story more newsworthy
  than just a simple, bland announcement. Even including some
  statistics to support your why will likely have a tremendous
  effect.</P
><P
>The same principle holds true for something as seemingly
  mundane as a new personnel selection. Why was there a vacancy?
  Why was this person selected to fill the spot? Adding either or
  both pieces of information to the release greatly increases the
  news interest.</P
><P
>One of the cardinal rules of media and public relations is: 
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Never promote features, always promote
  benefits."</SPAN
> A feature is any specific aspect that
  makes a product or service unique; features belong to products or
  services. A benefit is an advantage gained by the user in
  selecting a specific product or service; benefits belong to
  users. What a product or service does is nowhere near as
  meaningful as why there is some advantage or benefit to the
  user.</P
><P
>You don't need to completely ignore
  describing features, but you do need to present them in the
  context of their benefits to the end user. The reason for doing
  this is simple. Readers are potential users, and the better job
  you do of relating to the user, the more you will attract
  readers. Readers, as we already know, are the
  editor's Holy Grail.</P
><P
>If your release is about an event, there are numerous
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"whys"</SPAN
> you need to address. Why
  now? Why is your organization involved or being a sponsor? Why
  would anyone want to come to the event?</P
><P
>Be proactive and open in sharing the causes and anticipated
  effects of these accomplishments. Don't leave
  the editor wondering: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"So what?"</SPAN
>
  Failing to provide answers to why your activity is news is a
  sure-fire way of getting your release
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"filed"</SPAN
> in the recycle bin.</P

><P
>Cause and effect, and explaining why your news is
  happening, will very naturally lead to the
  <SPAN

>"how"</SPAN
> of your story. How did this
  come to pass? How are you accomplishing this? How did your
  organization decide to embark on this new and exciting
  initiative? How will this change affect people and the
  marketplace? Describing the <EM
>hows</EM
>
  gives color and interest to your story.</P
