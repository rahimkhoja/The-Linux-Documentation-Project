><P
>Who, what, where, when, why, and
  how&#8212;these are the six critical ingredients of
  all news releases. But don't forget, a little
  spice can make your news release stand out from the crowd. In
  this part, you will learn how to write a professional-looking
  news release, the most important tool in any public relations
  program.</P

NAME="headline"

>5.1.1. The Headline</H2
><P
>The headline is the first thing&#8212;and
  sometimes the only thing&#8212;an editor will read.
  Releases are often rejected as a result of a weak
  headline.</P
><P
>Create headlines with impact. The most effective words in a
  news release headline are eye-catching words like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"announces"</SPAN
> and
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"new."</SPAN
> Comparative words like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"better"</SPAN
> or
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"more"</SPAN
> can also draw attention to your article. The headline is the
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"hook"</SPAN
> that lures editors and reporters into reading more. Headlines
  must be compelling.</P
><P
>Many public relations novices make the mistake of
  embellishing their headlines. Your organization has to earn the
  respect of editors. Nobody owes you a reading. Too much
  information, or confusing information, is a turnoff. Most
  importantly, you should never sacrifice accuracy for the sake of
  a flashy headline.</P
><P
>Here are some guidelines for writing headlines:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Determine the most significant benefit your most
      important reader will derive from the news.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Try and state those benefits in seven words or
      less.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Ask yourself if your statement is meaningful to someone
      not closely involved with your business.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>When actually writing the headline, try to achieve the
  greatest impact using the fewest words. Your headline
  doesn't need to be quite as dramatic as a
  newspaper headline. Editors are looking for information in the
  headline, so try to at least include who, what, and why. Whatever
  the headline, you must accurately reflect the content that
  follows.</P

>5.1.2. The First Paragraph</H2
><P
>Many news releases are accepted or rejected on the basis of
  the headline and first paragraph or two. These introductory
  paragraphs are often all an editor will have time to read. Many
  releases are rejected due a simple downfall: failure to include
  any <EM
>news</EM
> in the first paragraph.</P
><P
>An important news-writing concept is 
  <EM
>collapsible copy.</EM
>
  Collapsible copy reads well from the beginning to the end of any
  given paragraph. The information is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"chunked"</SPAN
> to stand on its 
  own, if need be. Each sentence could be pulled from the news release and
  used as a quotation. This type of copy should be used as
  extensively as possible in all paragraphs.</P
><P
>Editors expect to see the five Ws covered in the first few
  sentences. Here's an example:</P

  the premier professional certification program for the Linux

  (<I
CLASS="citetitle"

TARGET="_top"
>www.unitedlinux.com</A
>
  </I
>), an industry initiative to streamline Linux development and
  certification around a global, uniform distribution, have signed
  a cooperative agreement to market a UnitedLinux professional
  certification program.</P
><P
>Under the memorandum of understanding, LPI and UnitedLinux
  will work jointly to create new UnitedLinux specific exams which,
  when passed together with the current LPI Levels 1 and 2 exams,
  will lead to two new UnitedLinux certifications. The new exams
  are expected to be available during the first quarter of
  2003.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>Let's look more closely at this example. The <EM
>where</EM
>
  and <EM
>when</EM
> of this and most releases are specified in the 
  <EM
>slug</EM
> (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"New York &#8212; January 22,

>). The <EM
>who</EM
> is LPI and UnitedLinux. The 
  <EM

  <EM

> is marketing a UnitedLinux professional certification
  program. And the <EM

>
  is LPI and UnitedLinux working jointly to create new UnitedLinux-specific
  exams.</P
><P
>These two paragraphs alone communicate the essential points
  of this announcement,. In print, there may not be enough space
  for more than this. Some special-interest journals devote a
  column or a page to announcements, which are printed verbatim
  from the news release. Unless the announcement is deemed more
  newsworthy, this may be all the coverage you get.</P

>5.1.3. The Middle Paragraphs</H2
><P
>Limited space in publications and time in broadcasting
  means the first paragraph <EM
>may</EM
>
  get covered. Paragraphs should always be ordered by importance
  for two important reasons.</P
><P
>First, editors read through releases quickly and often will
  not finish entire releases. You must consider what things are
  most important, and place them next in the release. Often, a
  statement from your spokesperson explaining the expected impacts
  on the marketplace or something related can be catchy enough to
  be quoted. Follow this with the next most important thing, and so on
  to the end of the release.</P
><P
>Second, sequence frequently indicates importance (unless
  the story is an in-depth feature that can establish pacing and
  shape). Stacking your news, in what some editors call the
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"inverted pyramid,"</SPAN
> can show
  editors the relative importance of your details. By following the
  inverted pyramid, you will make the editor's
  job easier and also accomplish your goal of getting the most
  critical information covered.</P

>5.1.4. Final Details</H2
><P
>You need to mark the end of your news release, so that
  editors know there is no further news. In journalism, this is
  traditionally done by putting <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"-30-"</SPAN
> or
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"-end-"</SPAN
> on a new, centered
  line, after the last line of copy, as follows:</P

>After ending the release, it is important to include the  
  <EM
>boilerplate</EM
>&#8212;
  standard, reusable background information
  about the organization issuing the news and contact information
  for editorial follow-up. The boilerplate includes the
  organization's web address where the editor
  can go for further details. Boilerplates can be reviewed and
  revised periodically, but they should maintain consistency.
  Wildly different boilerplates are unprofessional from one release
  to the next.</P
