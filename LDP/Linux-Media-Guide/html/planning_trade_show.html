>7.3. Planning for a Trade Show</H1
><P
>Planning for trade shows needs to start at least a few
  months in advance. If you wish to have a significant presence at
  strategic or influential show, you should plan to set up a booth,
  either on your own or with a key partner. Booth space is limited
  and must be reserved in advance. Usually a fee is involved, which
  varies according to square footage and location on the exhibition
  floor. Designing the portable booth can take a few months, so
  plan ahead.</P
><P
>Here are some tips for getting maximum benefit from your
  trade show appearances.</P

>7.3.1. Before the Show</H2
><P
>A major trade show requires considerable advance
  preparation and, if you aren't ready, can
  present a logistical nightmare. You must develop a solid plan and
  monitor your progress vigilantly.</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
><EM
>Evaluate and select trade shows carefully.</EM
></P
><P
>Participating in a show can require a major investment of
  time, money, and resources. Be tough in your evaluation of a
  show's worthiness. Are the attendees likely
  customers for your organization? Exposure to a few hundred very
  qualified targets is better than exposure to thousands of
  generalists who are very unlikely to be interested in your
  business.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Read the show manual.</EM
></P
><P
>Before you do anything, contact the organizers of the show
  to find the show's manual. Everything you need
  to know about the show should be there, including a proposed or
  final schedule, registration information and forms, floor plans,
  exhibit specifications, invitations for potential speakers, and
  other important details.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Identify your goals.</EM
></P
><P
>Be specific about the things you want to accomplish as a
  result of your participation in the show. Do you want to increase
  visibility, gain exposure to a large number of customers who
  might be interested in your products, or check out the
  competition? Concrete goals are important to determine the value
  of the trade show to your organization.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Define measurements of success.</EM
></P
><P
>For each goal, determine a way to measure its success. Make
  these measurements as specific as possible. You could plan to
  hand out 1000 brochures, obtain contact information for at least
  200 prospects, and take a key editor out to lunch. These
  benchmarks will help you decide whether the show was worth the
  expense.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Put your show plan in writing.</EM
></P
><P
>The plan should include a workable schedule, a
  comprehensive list of preparation activities, and an individual
  assigned for each task. You cannot leave things to chance, or
  else Murphy's Law (Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.) will surely
  prevail!</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Develop a key message for your booth exhibit.</EM
></P
><P
>Like good advertising, a good exhibit clearly communicates
  one major message. This draws in more prospects to your booth
  than an unfocused cacophony of messages.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Design an open, inviting booth.</EM
></P
><P
>An open booth design, with no tables obstructing access,
  invites attendees to come in. Your logo should be big enough to
  be seen from a good distance. Maximize <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"walking
  around"</SPAN
> space by mounting brochure displays on walls.
  Use interesting graphics to draw people's
  attention. For demos, laptops and flat-screen monitors are
  space-efficient. If space permits, provide comfortable chairs to
  encourage prospects to linger. A portable booth should be
  reasonably easy to set up and take down.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Advertise your show participation.</EM
></P
><P
>Use tag lines such as: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"see us at Booth
  1525 at the Linux World Conference"</SPAN
> in news releases
  and other communications leading up to the show (even if those
  releases are about something unrelated). Write a news release
  announcing show-related news. Invite editors to stop by the
  booth, or set up appointments between them and your
  spokespeople.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Order all necessary supplies, including brochures and
      giveaways.</EM
></P
><P
>If your marketing collateral needs to be updated or
  redesigned, take care of this early. You don't
  want to run the risk of having no brochures to hand out. Design forms for 
  filling out prospect information&#8212;clear forms eliminate
  guesswork. Consider giveaways to generate attention and a sense of
  fun. These don't have to be expensive. Pens
  with your web address and a catchy slogan can be very
  effective.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Design PowerPoint presentations and demos for the
      booth.</EM
></P
><P
>These will draw attendees to your booth and help them learn
  more about your business. Presentations will allow you to
  communicate information to many prospects at once.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Create a unique identity for your booth staff.</EM
></P
><P
>Decide on the dress code for your staff. Matching blazers,
  T-shirts, or even boutonnieres will make your representatives
  easily identifiable.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Train your exhibit staff before each show.</EM
></P
><P
>This is very important! Your staff needs to know what is
  expected of them. They need to be briefed on all new programs and
  initiatives that should be emphasized. They must know how to run
  the demos and presentations, and they should know some basic
  trouble shooting. Nothing looks more unprofessional then demos
  that don't work.</P

  addresses. (Creating an information form as suggested above will
  make this easier.)</P

>Encourage staff to greet people warmly and smile!</EM
></P
><P
>Amazingly, this is often forgotten. An inviting attitude
  can give a valuable first impression. The staff should avoid
  having their backs to the entrance, or taking phone calls while
  on duty. A friendly greeting to passersby may encourage them to
  stop rather than simply walk by. Staff who are uniformly
  courteous and helpful, knowledgeable about all aspects of the
  industry, and responsive to requests will make a very good
  impression.</P
