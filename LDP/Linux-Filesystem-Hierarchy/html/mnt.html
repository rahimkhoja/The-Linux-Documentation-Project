>This is a generic mount point under which you mount your filesystems
  or devices. Mounting is the process by which you make a filesystem available
  to the system. After mounting your files will be accessible under the
  mount-point. This directory usually contains mount points or sub-directories
  where you mount your floppy and your CD. You can also create additional
  mount-points here if you wish. Standard mount points would include
  /mnt/cdrom and /mnt/floppy. There is no limitation to creating a mount-point
  anywhere on your system but by convention and for sheer practicality do not
  litter your file system with mount-points. It should be noted that some
  distributions like Debian allocate /floppy and /cdrom as mount points while
  Redhat and Mandrake puts them in /mnt/floppy and /mnt/cdrom respectively.</P

  The operating system then does various bookkeeping things to make sure that

  The <B
CLASS="command"
>mount</B

  arguments. The first one is the device file corresponding to the disk or
  partition containing the filesystem. The second one is the directory below
  which it will be mounted. After these commands the contents of the two
  filesystems look just like the contents of the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
>
  and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr</TT
> directories, respectively. One would then say
  that ``<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/hda2</TT

CLASS="glossterm"
>is mounted on</I
>
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
>'', and similarly for
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr</TT
>. To look at either filesystem, one would look at
  the contents of the directory on which it has been mounted, just as if it
  were any other directory. Note the difference between the device file,
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/hda2</TT
>, and the mounted-on directory,
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
>. The device file gives access to the raw contents
  of the disk, the mounted-on directory gives access to the files on the disk.
  The mounted-on directory is called the <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>mount point</I
>.</P

>The mounted-on directory need not be empty,
  although it must exist. Any files in it, however, will be inaccessible by
  name while the filesystem is mounted. (Any files that have already been
  opened will still be accessible. Files that have hard links from other
  directories can be accessed using those names.) There is no harm done with
  this, and it can even be useful. For instance, some people like to have
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/tmp</TT

CLASS="filename"
>/var/tmp</TT
> synonymous, and
  make <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/tmp</TT

  When the system is booted, before the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
> filesystem
  is mounted, a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/tmp</TT
> directory residing on the root
  filesystem is used instead. When <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var</TT
> is mounted, it
  will make the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/tmp</TT
> directory on the root filesystem
  inaccessible. If <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/var/tmp</TT

  filesystem, it would be impossible to use temporary files before mounting
  <TT

CLASS="glossterm"
>read-only mount</I
>.
  This will make the kernel stop any attempts at writing to the filesystem,
  and will also stop the kernel from updating file access times in the inodes.
  Read-only mounts are necessary for unwritable media, e.g., CD-ROMs.</P
><P
>The alert reader has already noticed a slight logistical problem. How
  is the first filesystem (called the <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>root filesystem</I
>,
  because it contains the root directory) mounted, since it obviously
  can't be mounted on another filesystem? Well, the answer is that it is
  done by magic.</P
><P
>For more information, see the kernel source or
  the Kernel Hackers' Guide. </P
><P
>The root filesystem is
  magically mounted at boot time, and one can rely on it to always be mounted.
  If the root filesystem can't be mounted, the system does not boot. The
  name of the filesystem that is magically mounted as root is either compiled
  into the kernel, or set using LILO or <B
CLASS="command"
>rdev</B
>.</P
><P
>The root filesystem is usually first mounted read-only. The startup
  scripts will then run <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> to verify its validity, and if
  there are no problems, they will <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>re-mount</I
> it so that
  writes will also be allowed. <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> must not be run on a
  mounted filesystem, since any changes to the filesystem while
  <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> is running <EM
>will</EM
> cause trouble.
  Since the root filesystem is mounted read-only while it is being checked,
  <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> can fix any problems without worry, since the
  remount operation will flush any metadata that the filesystem keeps in
  memory.</P
><P
>On many systems there are other filesystems that should
  also be mounted automatically at boot time. These are specified in the
  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> file; see the fstab man page for details on
  the format. The details of exactly when the extra filesystems are mounted
  depend on many factors, and can be configured by each administrator if need
  be.</P

  It is imperative that you always unmount a mounted floppy.
  <EM
>Don't just pop the floppy out of the drive!</EM
> Because
  of disk caching, the data is not necessarily written to the floppy until you
  unmount it, so removing the floppy from the drive too early might cause the
  contents to become garbled. If you only read from the floppy, this is not
  very likely, but if you write, even accidentally, the result may be
  catastrophic.</P
><P
>Mounting and unmounting requires super user
  privileges, i.e., only root can do it. The reason for this is that if any
  user can mount a floppy on any directory, then it is rather easy to create a
  floppy with, say, a Trojan horse disguised as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin/sh</TT

  or any other often used program. However, it is often necessary to allow
