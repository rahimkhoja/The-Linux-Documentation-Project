          6.12. Re-adjusting the Toolchain
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the final C libraries have been installed, it is time to
        adjust the toolchain again. The toolchain will be adjusted so that it
        will link any newly compiled program against these new libraries.
        This is the same process used in the &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">Adjusting</span>&rdquo; phase in the beginning of <a href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a>, but with the adjustments
        reversed. In <a href="../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a>, the
        chain was guided from the host's <tt class=
        "filename">/{,usr/}lib</tt> directories to the new <tt class=
        "filename">/tools/lib</tt> directory. Now, the chain will be guided
        from that same <tt class="filename">/tools/lib</tt> directory to the
        LFS <tt class="filename">/{,usr/}lib</tt> directories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by adjusting the linker. The source and build directories from
        the second pass of Binutils were retained for this purpose. Install
        the adjusted linker by running the following command from within the
        <tt class="filename">binutils-build</tt> directory:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">make -C ld INSTALL=/tools/bin/install install</kbd></pre>
      <div class="note">
        <div class="admonhead">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3 class="admontitle">
            Note
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            If the earlier warning to retain the Binutils source and build
            directories from the second pass in <a href=
            "../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> was missed, or if
            they were accidentally deleted or are inaccessible, ignore the
            above command. The result will be that the next package,
            Binutils, will link against the C libraries in <tt class=
            "filename">/tools</tt> rather than in <tt class=
            "filename">/{,usr/}lib</tt>. This is not ideal, however, testing
            has shown that the resulting Binutils program binaries should be
            identical.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        From now on, every compiled program will link only against the
        libraries in <tt class="filename">/usr/lib</tt> and <tt class=
        "filename">/lib</tt>. The extra <em class=
        "parameter"><tt>INSTALL=/tools/bin/install</tt></em> option is needed
        because the <tt class="filename">Makefile</tt> file created during
        the second pass still contains the reference to <span><strong class=
        "command">/usr/bin/install</strong></span>, which has not been
        installed yet. Some host distributions contain a <tt class=
        "filename">ginstall</tt> symbolic link which takes precedence in the
        <tt class="filename">Makefile</tt> file and can cause a problem. The
        above command takes care of this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove the Binutils source and build directories now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, amend the GCC specs file so that it points to the new dynamic
        linker. A <span><strong class="command">perl</strong></span> command
        accomplishes this:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">perl -pi -e 's@ /tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2@ /lib/ld-linux.so.2@g;' \
    -e 's@\*startfile_prefix_spec:\n@$_/usr/lib/ @g;' \
        `gcc --print-file specs`</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        It is a good idea to visually inspect the specs file to verify the
        intended change was actually made.
      </p>
      <div class="important">
        <div class="admonhead">
          <img alt="[Important]" src="../images/important.png" />
          <h3 class="admontitle">
            Important

        </div>
        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            If working on a platform where the name of the dynamic linker is
            something other than <tt class="filename">ld-linux.so.2</tt>,
            substitute &ldquo;<span class="quote">ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo;
            with the name of the platform's dynamic linker in the above
            commands. Refer back to <a href=
            "../chapter05/toolchaintechnotes.html" title=
            "5.2.&nbsp;Toolchain Technical Notes">Section 5.2,
            &ldquo;Toolchain Technical Notes,&rdquo;</a> if necessary.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="caution">
        <div class="admonhead">
          <img alt="[Caution]" src="../images/caution.png" />
          <h3 class="admontitle">
            Caution
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            It is imperative at this point to stop and ensure that the basic
            functions (compiling and linking) of the adjusted toolchain are
            working as expected. To do this, perform a sanity check:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">echo 'main(){}' &gt; dummy.c
cc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep ': /lib'</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            If everything is working correctly, there should be no errors,
            and the output of the last command will be (allowing for
            platform-specific differences in dynamic linker name):
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><tt class=
          "computeroutput">[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.2]</tt></pre>
          <p>
            Note that <tt class="filename">/lib</tt> is now the prefix of our
            dynamic linker.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the output does not appear as shown above or is not received
            at all, then something is seriously wrong. Investigate and
            retrace the steps to find out where the problem is and correct
            it. The most likely reason is that something went wrong with the
            specs file amendment above. Any issues will need to be resolved
            before continuing on with the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once everything is working correctly, clean up the test files:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">rm -v dummy.c a.out</kbd></pre>
