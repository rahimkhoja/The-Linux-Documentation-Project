          5.7. Adjusting the Toolchain
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the temporary C libraries have been installed, all tools
        compiled in the rest of this chapter should be linked against these
        libraries. In order to accomplish this, the linker and the compiler's
        specs file need to be adjusted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The linker, adjusted at the end of the first pass of Binutils, is
        installed by running the following command from within the <tt class=
        "filename">binutils-build</tt> directory:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">make -C ld install</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        From this point onwards, everything will link only against the
        libraries in <tt class="filename">/tools/lib</tt>.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <div class="admonhead">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3 class="admontitle">
            Note
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            If the earlier warning to retain the Binutils source and build
            directories from the first pass was missed, ignore the above
            command. This results in a small chance that the subsequent
            testing programs will link against libraries on the host. This is
            not ideal, but it is not a major problem. The situation is
            corrected when the second pass of Binutils is installed later.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that the adjusted linker is installed, the Binutils build and
        source directories should be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next task is to amend the GCC specs file so that it points to the
        new dynamic linker. A simple sed script will accomplish this:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">SPECFILE=`gcc --print-file specs` &amp;&amp;
sed 's@ /lib/ld-linux.so.2@ /tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2@g' \
    $SPECFILE &gt; tempspecfile &amp;&amp;
mv -f tempspecfile $SPECFILE &amp;&amp;
unset SPECFILE</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        <span>It is recommended that the above command be copy-and-pasted in
        order to ensure accuracy.</span> Alternatively, the specs file can be
        edited by hand. This is done by replacing every occurrence of
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">/lib/ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo; with
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">/tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to visually inspect the specs file in order to verify the
        intended changes have been made.
      </p>

          <h3 class="admontitle">

        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            If working on a platform where the name of the dynamic linker is
            something other than <tt class="filename">ld-linux.so.2</tt>,
            replace &ldquo;<span class="quote">ld-linux.so.2</span>&rdquo;
            with the name of the platform's dynamic linker in the above
            commands. Refer back to <a href="toolchaintechnotes.html" title=
            "5.2.&nbsp;Toolchain Technical Notes">Section 5.2,
            &ldquo;Toolchain Technical Notes,&rdquo;</a> if necessary.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        There is a possibility that some include files from the host system
        have found their way into GCC's private include dir. This can happen
        as a result of GCC's &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">fixincludes</span>&rdquo; process, which runs as part of the
        GCC build. This is explained in more detail later in this chapter.
        Run the following command to eliminate this possibility:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">rm -vf /tools/lib/gcc/*/*/include/{pthread.h,bits/sigthread.h}</kbd></pre>
      <div class="caution">
        <div class="admonhead">
          <img alt="[Caution]" src="../images/caution.png" />
          <h3 class="admontitle">
            Caution
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            At this point, it is imperative to stop and ensure that the basic
            functions (compiling and linking) of the new toolchain are
            working as expected. To perform a sanity check, run the following
            commands:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">echo 'main(){}' &gt; dummy.c
cc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep ': /tools'</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            If everything is working correctly, there should be no errors,
            and the output of the last command will be of the form:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen"><tt class=
          "computeroutput">[Requesting program interpreter: 
    /tools/lib/ld-linux.so.2]</tt></pre>
          <p>
            Note that <tt class="filename">/tools/lib</tt> appears as the
            prefix of the dynamic linker.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the output is not shown as above or there was no output at
            all, then something is wrong. Investigate and retrace the steps
            to find out where the problem is and correct it. This issue must
            be resolved before continuing on. First, perform the sanity check
            again, using <span><strong class="command">gcc</strong></span>
            instead of <span><strong class="command">cc</strong></span>. If
            this works, then the <tt class="filename">/tools/bin/cc</tt>
            symlink is missing. Revisit <a href="gcc-pass1.html" title=
            "5.4.&nbsp;GCC-3.4.3 - Pass 1">Section 5.4, &ldquo;GCC-3.4.3 -
            Pass 1,&rdquo;</a> and install the symlink. Next, ensure that the
            <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> is correct. This can be checked by
            running <span><strong class="command">echo $PATH</strong></span>
            and verifying that <tt class="filename">/tools/bin</tt> is at the
            head of the list. If the <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> is wrong it
            could mean that you are not logged in as user <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>lfs</em></span> or that something went wrong back
            in <a href="../chapter04/settingenvironment.html" title=
            "4.4.&nbsp;Setting Up the Environment">Section 4.4,
            &ldquo;Setting Up the Environment.&rdquo;</a> Another option is
            that something may have gone wrong with the specs file amendment
            above. In this case, redo the specs file amendment<span>, being
            careful to copy-and-paste the commands</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all is well, clean up the test files:
          </p>
          <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
          "command">rm -v dummy.c a.out</kbd></pre>
          <p>
            Building TCL in the next section will serve as an additional
            check that the toolchain has been built properly. If TCL fails to
            build, it is an indication that something has gone wrong with the
            Binutils, GCC, or Glibc installation, but not with TCL itself.
