          4.4. Setting Up the Environment
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Set up a good working environment by creating two new startup files
        for the <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> shell.
        While logged in as user <span class="emphasis"><em>lfs</em></span>,
        issue the following command to create a new <tt class=
        "filename">.bash_profile</tt>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat &gt; ~/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class=
"literal">exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        When logged on as user <span class="emphasis"><em>lfs</em></span>,
        the initial shell is usually a <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>login</em></span> shell which reads the <tt class=
        "filename">/etc/profile</tt> of the host (probably containing some
        settings and environment variables) and then <tt class=
        "filename">.bash_profile</tt>. The <span><strong class="command">exec
        env -i.../bin/bash</strong></span> command in the <tt class=
        "filename">.bash_profile</tt> file replaces the running shell with a
        new one with a completely empty environment, except for the
        <tt class="envar">HOME</tt>, <tt class="envar">TERM</tt>, and
        <tt class="envar">PS1</tt> variables. This ensures that no unwanted
        and potentially hazardous environment variables from the host system
        leak into the build environment. The technique used here achieves the
        goal of ensuring a clean environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new instance of the shell is a <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>non-login</em></span> shell, which does not read the
        <tt class="filename">/etc/profile</tt> or <tt class=
        "filename">.bash_profile</tt> files, but rather reads the <tt class=
        "filename">.bashrc</tt> file instead. Create the <tt class=
        "filename">.bashrc</tt> file now:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat &gt; ~/.bashrc &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class="literal">set +h
umask 022
LFS=/mnt/lfs
LC_ALL=POSIX
PATH=/tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
export LFS LC_ALL PATH</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        The <span><strong class="command">set +h</strong></span> command
        turns off <span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span>'s hash
        function. Hashing is ordinarily a useful
        feature&mdash;<span><strong class="command">bash</strong></span> uses
        a hash table to remember the full path of executable files to avoid
        searching the <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> time and again to find the
        same executable. However, the new tools should be used as soon as
        they are installed. By switching off the hash function, the shell
        will always search the <tt class="envar">PATH</tt> when a program is
        to be run. As such, the shell will find the newly compiled tools in
        <tt class="filename">$LFS/tools</tt> as soon as they are available
        without remembering a previous version of the same program in a
        different location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting the user file-creation mask (umask) to 022 ensures that newly
        created files and directories are only writable by their owner, but
        are readable and executable by anyone (assuming default modes are
        used by the open(2) system call, new files will end up with
        permission mode 644 and directories with mode 755).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt class="envar">LFS</tt> variable should be set to the chosen
        mount point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt class="envar">LC_ALL</tt> variable controls the localization
        of certain programs, making their messages follow the conventions of
        a specified country. If the host system uses a version of Glibc older
        than 2.2.4, having <tt class="envar">LC_ALL</tt> set to something
        other than &ldquo;<span class="quote">POSIX</span>&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">C</span>&rdquo; (during this chapter) may
        cause issues if you exit the chroot environment and wish to return
        later. Setting <tt class="envar">LC_ALL</tt> to &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">POSIX</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">C</span>&rdquo; (the two are equivalent) ensures that
        everything will work as expected in the chroot environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        By putting <tt class="filename">/tools/bin</tt> ahead of the standard
        <tt class="envar">PATH</tt>, all the programs installed in <a href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a> are picked up by the
        shell immediately after their installation. This, combined with
        turning off hashing, limits the risk that old programs are used from
        the host when the same programs are available in the chapter 5
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, to have the environment fully prepared for building the
        temporary tools, source the just-created user profile:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">source ~/.bash_profile</kbd></pre>
