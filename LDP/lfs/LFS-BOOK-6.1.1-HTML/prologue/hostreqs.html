          4. Host System Requirements
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        The host must be running at least a 2.6.2 kernel compiled with
        GCC-3.0 or higher. There are two main reasons for this requirement.
        First, the Native POSIX Threading Library (NPTL) test suite will
        segfault if the host's kernel has not been compiled with GCC-3.0 or a
        later version. Second, the 2.6.2 or later version of the kernel is
        required for the use of Udev. Udev creates devices dynamically by
        reading from the <tt class="systemitem">sysfs</tt> file system.
        However, support for this filesystem has only recently been
        implemented in most of the kernel drivers. We must be sure that all
        critical system devices get created properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to determine whether the host kernel meets the requirements
        outlined above, run the following command:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat /proc/version</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        This will produce output similar to:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><tt class=
      "computeroutput">Linux version 2.6.2 (user@host) (gcc version 3.4.0) #1
    Tue Apr 20 21:22:18 GMT 2004</tt></pre>
      <p>
        If the results of the above command do not state that the host kernel
        is either 2.6.2 (or later), or that it was not compiled using a
        GCC-3.0 (or later) compiler, one will need to be installed. There are
        two methods you can take to solve this. First, see if your Linux
        vendor provides a 2.6.2 (or later) kernel package. If so, you may
        wish to install it. If your vendor doesn't offer a 2.6.2 (or later)
        kernel package, or you would prefer not to install it, then you can
        compile a 2.6 kernel yourself. Instructions for compiling the kernel
        and configuring the boot loader (assuming the host uses GRUB) are
        located in <a href="../chapter08/chapter08.html">Chapter 8</a>. This
        second option can also be seen as a gauge of your current Linux
        skills. If this second requirement is too steep, then the LFS book
        will not likely be much use to you at this time.
