          7.9. The Bash Shell Startup Files
        </h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        The shell program <span><strong class=
        "command">/bin/bash</strong></span> (hereafter referred to as
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">the shell</span>&rdquo;) uses a collection
        of startup files to help create an environment to run in. Each file
        has a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments
        differently. The files in the <tt class="filename">/etc</tt>
        directory provide global settings. If an equivalent file exists in
        the home directory, it may override the global settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using
        <span><strong class="command">/bin/login</strong></span>, by reading
        the <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> file. An interactive
        non-login shell is started at the command-line (e.g., <tt class=
        "prompt">[prompt]$</tt><span><strong class=
        "command">/bin/bash</strong></span>). A non-interactive shell is
        usually present when a shell script is running. It is non-interactive
        because it is processing a script and not waiting for user input
        between commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information, see <span><strong class="command">info
        bash</strong></span> under the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bash
        Startup Files and Interactive Shells</em></span> section.
      </p>
      <p>
        The files <tt class="filename">/etc/profile</tt> and <tt class=
        "filename">~/.bash_profile</tt> are read when the shell is invoked as
        an interactive login shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The base <tt class="filename">/etc/profile</tt> below sets some
        environment variables necessary for native language support. Setting
        them properly results in:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The output of programs translated into the native language
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Correct classification of characters into letters, digits and
              other classes. This is necessary for <span><strong class=
              "command">bash</strong></span> to properly accept non-ASCII
              characters in command lines in non-English locales
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The correct alphabetical sorting order for the country
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Appropriate default paper size
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Correct formatting of monetary, time, and date values
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        This script also sets the <tt class="envar">INPUTRC</tt> environment
        variable that makes Bash and Readline use the <tt class=
        "filename">/etc/inputrc</tt> file created earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Replace <em class="replaceable"><tt>[ll]</tt></em> below with the
        two-letter code for the desired language (e.g., &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">en</span>&rdquo;) and <em class=
        "replaceable"><tt>[CC]</tt></em> with the two-letter code for the
        appropriate country (e.g., &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">GB</span>&rdquo;). <em class=
        "replaceable"><tt>[charmap]</tt></em> should be replaced with the
        canonical charmap for your chosen locale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list of all locales supported by Glibc can be obtained by running
        the following command:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">locale -a</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Locales can have a number of synonyms, e.g. &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">ISO-8859-1</span>&rdquo; is also referred to as
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">iso8859-1</span>&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">iso88591</span>&rdquo;. Some applications
        cannot handle the various synonyms correctly, so it is safest to
        choose the canonical name for a particular locale. To determine the
        canonical name, run the following command, where <em class=
        "replaceable"><tt>[locale name]</tt></em> is the output given by
        <span><strong class="command">locale -a</strong></span> for your
        preferred locale (&ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">en_GB.iso88591</span>&rdquo; in our example).
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">LC_ALL=<em class=
      "replaceable"><tt>[locale name]</tt></em> locale charmap</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        For the &ldquo;<span class="quote">en_GB.iso88591</span>&rdquo;
        locale, the above command will print:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen">ISO-8859-1</pre>
      <p>
        This results in a final locale setting of &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">en_GB.ISO-8859-1</span>&rdquo;. It is important that the
        locale found using the heuristic above is tested prior to it being
        added to the Bash startup files:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">LC_ALL=[locale name] locale country
LC_ALL=[locale name] locale language
LC_ALL=[locale name] locale charmap
LC_ALL=[locale name] locale int_curr_symbol
LC_ALL=[locale name] locale int_prefix</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        The above commands should print the country and language names, the
        character encoding used by the locale, the local currency and the
        prefix to dial before the telephone number in order to get into the
        country. If any of the commands above fail with a message similar to
        the one shown below, this means that your locale was either not
        installed in Chapter 6 or is not supported by the default
        installation of Glibc.
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><tt class=
      "computeroutput">locale: Cannot set LC_* to default locale: No such file or directory</tt></pre>
      <p>
        If this happens, you should either install the desired locale using
        the <span><strong class="command">localedef</strong></span> command,
        or consider choosing a different locale. Further instructions assume
        that there are no such error messages from Glibc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some packages beyond LFS may also lack support for your chosen
        locale. One example is the X library (part of the X Window System),
        which outputs the following error message:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><tt class=
      "computeroutput">Warning: locale not supported by Xlib, locale set to C</tt></pre>
      <p>
        Sometimes it is possible to fix this by removing the charmap part of
        the locale specification, as long as that does not change the
        character map that Glibc associates with the locale (this can be
        checked by running the <span><strong class="command">locale
        charmap</strong></span> command in both locales). For example, one
        would have to change "de_DE.ISO-8859-15@euro" to "de_DE@euro" in
        order to get this locale recognized by Xlib.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other packages can also function incorrectly (but may not necessarily
        display any error messages) if the locale name does not meet their
        expectations. In those cases, investigating how other Linux
        distributions support your locale might provide some useful
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the proper locale settings have been determined, create the
        <tt class="filename">/etc/profile</tt> file:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat &gt; /etc/profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<tt class="literal"># Begin /etc/profile

export LANG=<em class="replaceable"><tt>[ll]</tt></em>_<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>[CC]</tt></em>.<em class=
"replaceable"><tt>[charmap]</tt></em>
export INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc

# End /etc/profile</tt>
EOF</kbd></pre>
      <div class="note">
        <div class="admonhead">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3 class="admontitle">
            Note
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="admonbody">
          <p>
            The &ldquo;<span class="quote">C</span>&rdquo; (default) and
            &ldquo;<span class="quote">en_US</span>&rdquo; (the recommended
            one for United States English users) locales are different.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Setting the keyboard layout, screen font, and locale-related
        environment variables are the only internationalization steps needed
        to support locales that use ordinary single-byte encodings and
        left-to-right writing direction. More complex cases (including UTF-8
        based locales) require additional steps and additional patches
        because many applications tend to not work properly under such
        conditions. These steps and patches are not included in the LFS book
        and such locales are not yet supported by LFS.
