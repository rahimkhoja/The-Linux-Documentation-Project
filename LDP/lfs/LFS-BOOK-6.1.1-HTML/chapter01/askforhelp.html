        If an issue or a question is encountered while working through this
        book, check the FAQ page at <a href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/#generalfaq"><i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/#generalfaq</i></a>.
        Questions are often already answered there. If your question is not
        answered on this page, try to find the source of the problem. The
        following hint will give you some guidance for troubleshooting:

        http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/errors.txt</i></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you cannot find your problem listed in the FAQ, search the mailing
        lists at <a href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html"><i>http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html</i></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have a wonderful LFS community that is willing to offer
        assistance through the mailing lists and IRC (see the <a href=
        "resources.html" title="1.3.&nbsp;Resources">Section&nbsp;1.3,
        &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;</a> section of this book). However, we get
        several support questions everyday and many of them can be easily
        answered by going to the FAQ and by searching the mailing lists
        first. So for us to offer the best assistance possible, you need to
        do some research on your own first. That allows us to focus on the
        more unusual support needs. If your searches do not produce a
        solution, please include all relevant information (mentioned below)
        in your request for help.

            1.4.2. Configure Script Problems

        <p>
          If something goes wrong while running the <span><strong class=

          "filename">config.log</tt> file. This file may contain errors
          encountered during <span><strong class=
          "command">configure</strong></span> which were not printed to the
          screen. Include the <span class="emphasis"><em>relevant</em></span>
          lines if you need to ask for help.

            1.4.3. Compilation Problems
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Both the screen output and the contents of various files are useful
          in determining the cause of compilation problems. The screen output
          from the <span><strong class="command">configure</strong></span>
          script and the <span><strong class="command">make</strong></span>
          run can be helpful. It is not necessary to include the entire
          output, but do include enough of the relevant information. Below is
          an example of the type of information to include from the screen
          output from <span><strong class="command">make</strong></span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen"><tt class=
        "computeroutput">gcc -DALIASPATH=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale:.\"
-DLOCALEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale\" 
-DLIBDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/lib\"
-DINCLUDEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/include\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.
-g -O2 -c getopt1.c
gcc -g -O2 -static -o make ar.o arscan.o commands.o dir.o 
expand.o file.o function.o getopt.o implicit.o job.o main.o 
misc.o read.o remake.o rule.o signame.o variable.o vpath.o 
default.o remote-stub.o version.o opt1.o
-lutil job.o: In function `load_too_high':
/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1/job.c:1565: undefined reference 
to `getloadavg'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [make] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2</tt></pre>
        <p>
          In this case, many people would just include the bottom section:
        </p>
        <pre class="screen"><tt class=
        "computeroutput">make [2]: *** [make] Error 1</tt></pre>
        <p>
          This is not enough information to properly diagnose the problem
          because it only notes that something went wrong, not <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>what</em></span> went wrong. The entire section, as
          in the example above, is what should be saved because it includes
          the command that was executed and the associated error message(s).
