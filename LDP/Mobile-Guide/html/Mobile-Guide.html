>&#13;   Mobile computer devices (laptops, notebooks, PDAs, mobile cell phones,
   portable audio and video players, digital cameras,
   calculators, wearables, ...) are different from desktop/tower computers.
   They use certain hardware such as PCMCIA cards,
   infrared and BlueTooth ports, wireless LAN,  LCD displays, batteries,
   docking stations. Hardware parts cannot be changed as easily as in a
   desktops, e.g. the graphics card. Often their hardware is more limited
   (e.g. disk space, CPU speed). Though the performance gap to
   desktops is becoming smaller, e.g. in many instances, laptops or
   notebooks can become a desktop replacement.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Hardware support for Linux (and other operating systems) and mobile
   computer devices is sometimes more limited (e.g. graphics chips, internal modems).
   They often use specialized hardware, hence finding a driver can be more
   difficult. Many times they are used in changing environments, so there
   is a need for multiple configurations and additional security
   strategies.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Though there are laptop, notebook, PDA and mobile phone 
   related HOWTOs available already, this guide contains 
   a concise survey of documents related to mobile computer
   devices. Also Linux features, such as installation methods 
   for laptops, notebooks and PDAs as well as configurations for
   different (network) environments are described.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Although there are some caveats, Linux is a better choice for mobile
   computer devices than most other operating systems, because it supports
   numerous installation methods, works in many heterogeneous environments
   and needs smaller resources.

   rather than with desktops. I like Linux too. My first HOWTO was the

   , about some ways to use Linux in an ecology aware
   manner.

   I had a chance to put Linux on. You may find them at

   the warranty void. Though in my humble opinion this isn't legal or at
   least not fair. Always have a backup of both the original configuration

   Weight: Often expressed in terms like Portables, Laptops/Notebooks,
   Sub/Mini-Notebooks, Palmtops/PDAs. There is no standard method to define
   the weight of a laptop, therefore the data provided by the manufacturers
   (and which are given below) have to be considered as approximations. The
   question is how the power supply (whether external or internal) or
   swappable parts like CD and floppy drive, are included in the weight.

>&#13;   Most peripheral  cables
   are appallingly heavy. If you get a subnotebook and carry it around with
   a bunch of external drives, cables, and <EM

   heavier bag than if it were all in one box. Subnotebooks are useful
   mainly if you can afford to leave all the other junk behind.

   Please try to get as much information about these topics before buying a

   Sometimes even the specifications or the hotline of the manufacturer
   aren't able to provide the information. Therefore I have included a

   Active matrix
   displays have better color and contrast, but usually cost
   more and use more power. Also consider the screen size.
   Laptops may be purchased with screens up to 17". A bigger
   screen weighs more, costs more, and is harder to carry,

>&#13;   At higher speed, a CPU consumes more power and generates more heat.
   Therefore, in many laptops a special low-power CPU is used.
   Usually, this special CPU doesn't use as much power as a similar
   processor used in a desktop. These special CPUs are also more expensive.
   As a side effect you may find that laptops with a desktop CPU often have

   Though I would like to encourage you to take a
   <EM
>no-name</EM
> product, there are some caveats. I have
   experienced that laptops break often, so you are better off, when you
   have an after-sales warranty, which is usually only offered with brand
   products. Or you may decide to take a <EM

>
   machine. When I tried this, I discovered that the laptop market is
   changing quite often.  A new generation is released approximately every
   three months (compared by CPU speed, harddisk capacity, screen size
   etc.). So laptops become old very quick. But this scheme often isn't
   followed by the prices for second hand laptops. They seem too expensive
   to me. Anyway if you plan on purchasing a second hand machine, review my
   recommendations on checking the machine.

>&#13;   A Message to Linux Distributors:
   If you happen to be a Linux distributor, thank you for reading all this.
   Laptops are becoming more and more popular, but still most Linux
   distributions are not very well prepared for portable computing. Please
   make this section of this document obsolete, and make a few changes in
   your distribution.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The installation routine should include a configuration, optimized for
   laptops. The <EM
>minimal install</EM
> is often not lean
   enough. There are a lot of things that a laptop user does not need on
   the road. Just a few examples. There is no need for three different
   versions of <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
>. Some portable systems do not
   need printing support.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Don't forget to describe <EM
>laptop-specific installation
   problems</EM
>, e. g. how to install your distribution without a
   CD/DVD-ROM drive.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Add better <EM
>power management</EM
> and seamless
   <EM
><SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> support</EM
> to your
   distribution. Add a recompiled kernel and an alternative set of
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> drivers with <EM
>apm support</EM
>
   that the user can install on demand. Include a precompiled
   <EM

   <SPAN
CLASS="trademark"
>IrDA</SPAN
>&reg; infrared support and
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>USB</SPAN

</P
><P
>&#13;   Add support for dynamically <EM

   configurations</EM
>. Most Linux laptops travel between locations
   with different network settings (e. g. the network at home, the network
   at the office and the network at the university) and have to change the

>3.4.5. From a Second (Desktop) Machine With a Hard Disk Adapter</H2
><P
>&#13;   From Adam Sulmicki &#60;adam_AT_cfar.unc.edu&#62; I got this hint: Most but not
   all harddisks in laptops are removable, but this might be not an easy
   task. You could just buy one of those cheap 2.5" IDE converters/adapters
   which allow you to connect this harddisk temporarily to a desktop PC with IDE
   subsystem, and install Linux as usual using that PC. You may do so using
   the harddisk as the first IDE drive or besides as the second IDE drive.
   But then you need to be sure that the bootloader (e.g.
   <B
CLASS="command"
>lilo</B
>)
   writes to the right partition.
   Also you have to make sure that you use the same translation style as
   your laptop is going to use (i.e. LBA vs. LARGE vs. CHS ). 
   You will find additional information in the 
   <A
HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Hard-Disk-Upgrade/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Hard-Disk-Upgrade-HOWTO</A
>. 
   You might copy an existing partition, but it is also possible to achieve a
   customized installation. Instead of a desktop PC you may use a
   second laptop, which may offer better features like a CD/DVD, to put the harddisk in.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The most common adapter formats are 2.5" IDE adapters (Parallel ATA - PATA). As
   far as I know Serial ATA (SATA) harddisks are not available for laptops
   yet. But they could be attached to Serial ATA interfaces in a desktop PC
   even without an adapter (at least I guess, but I will verify this as soon
   as I have SATA equipment available). Some small subnotebooks feature
   1.8" harddisks with ZIF connectors. These connectors are ATA compatible,
   and IDE adaptors for them are available also.

</P
><P
>&#13;   From Jeremy Impson &#60;jdimpson_AT_acm.org&#62;: I installed Red Hat 6.1
   on a Libretto 50CT. It only has a PCMCIA floppy drive. (Which BTW isn't
   well supported by the default PCMCIA floppy driver. I needed to download
   a patch from some Linux on Libretto web site.)
</P
><P
>&#13;   Linux will boot off the PCMCIA floppy drive, however. It just can't go
   back to the floppy after loading the kernel. My Libretto (the 50CT) only
   has one PCMCIA slot (later models had two slots, or I could have gotten
   the enhanced port replicator, which gave it another slot). So I couldn't
   boot off a floppy and then mount a remote filesystem.
</P
><P
>&#13;   So I downloaded ZipSlack (Slackware designed for running from a ZIP
   disk) and used another PC to load it onto a ZIP disk. I attached the ZIP
   drive to the Libretto (via the parallel port on the regular port
   replicator that comes with it) and booted from the Slackware boot disk
   in the PCMCIA floppy drive. When booted, I removed the floppy drive and
   inserted and configured a network PCMCIA card. At this point the kernel
   is in memory and it is using the filesystem on the ZIP disk.
</P
><P
>&#13;   I partitioned and formatted the Libretto's harddrive and then ftp'd Red
   Hat 6.1 installation source onto one of the new partitions (the
   partition that would become <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
> when everything
   gets done). This is the key: if you don't have enough disk space to have
   the installation files plus enough to actually install the OS on to,
   this method won't work.
</P
><P
>&#13;   I shut down the ZipSlack kernel and rebooted it using a RedHat install
   disk in the floppy drive. I pointed it at the RH6.1 installation media
   already on the harddrive and started the install.

>3.4.8. From a Parallel Port CD Drive (MicroSolutions BackPack)</H2
><P
>&#13;   I had tried myself to install Linux using the MicroSolutions BackPack
   parallel CD-ROM drive. It is fully supported by Linux and I haven't had
   any major problem running it. Until version 2.0.36 it is supported by
   its own module (<B
CLASS="command"
>bpck</B
>) while in later versions it
   has been merged in the more general parallel port ide adaptors (the
   <B
CLASS="command"
>paride</B
> module that relays then of course on more
   specific low level drivers, which in the BackPack case is still called
   <B
CLASS="command"
>bpck</B
>). 
</P
><P
>&#13;   In RedHat 5.x based installations the <B
CLASS="command"
>bpck</B
> module is
   available already at installation stage so you'll just have to select
   the BackPack cdrom from the <EM
>Other CD-ROMs</EM
> at the
   installation stage and then give it some more options (but
   <B
CLASS="command"
>autoprobe</B
> should work just fine).
</P
><P
>&#13;   In RedHat 6.x (which uses 2.2.x kernels and should then use 
   <B
CLASS="command"
>paride</B
>), the BackPack support was dropped. So to
   install the distribution from such a device, you will have to customize the
   bootdisk (adding the necessary modules) and the installation will be
   done without any problem.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Federico Pellegrin has customized a RedHat bootdisk that includes all the
   parallel CDROM devices that are supported by the distribution Linux
   kernel version (2.2.12) that should then work on all the supported
   parallel CDROM devices (even if he only tested it on his MicroSolutions
   BackPack since he doesn't have other similar hardware). You can find
   <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sole.infis.univ.trieste.it/~drzeus/rh_pcd.html"
TARGET="_top"
>some information on it and the bootdisk image</A
>.
</P
><P
>&#13;   As from RedHat 6.2 a supplementary driver disk was included in the
   distribution to support the paride devices. You'll just have to create
   the driver disk (the image file is <B
CLASS="command"
>paride.img</B
> and can
   be found in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>images/drivers</TT
> directory) in the
   usual way and insert it when the installer will ask for it.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Of course I suppose there isn't any problem in installing any other
   Linux distribution using such a device as long as you can add and
   configure the appropriate modules at the very beginning of the
   installation stage, but I haven't tested any.
</P
><P
>&#13;   You should take care of the mode the parallel port uses (ECP, EPP,
   Output only, PS/2) since some of them may cause your laptop to suddenly
   freeze or cause serious data corruption. On the other side some modes
   make the communication dramatically slow (I found the best choice on my
   laptop the PS/2, but you should make some tests).

>3.4.12. Installing via VNC</H2
><P
>&#13;You might ask why do a laptop installation via the VNC protocol? 
Indeed I know only of one reason to do so. Imagine you want
to use a laptop with a broken keyboard you may use the
keyboard of the remote machine to achieve the installation. 
Though you have to do a few key stroke to initiate the VNC
installation!
You have to prepare the source machine accordingly (instructions how
to do so will follow later). For recent SuSE versions the
distribution is already prepared, see the handbook for details.

>3.4.14. Installing Linux on Apple Macintosh PowerBooks and iBooks</H2

>&#13;   Macintosh PowerBooks these days come with a CD/DVD drive but not a
   floppy drive, but the Linux distributions for PPC support booting and
   installation off of a CD without any need for a floppy.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Sometimes, when you boot the installer on the PowerBooks, the screen is
   black; this is easily fixed by tapping the brightness key on the
   keyboard (somehow, the screen brightness gets reset to zero).
</P
><P
>&#13;   If you have a very recent PowerBook, it may not be supported by the
   kernel on the installation CD. You can get around this by booting off of
   a recent kernel downloaded onto your hard drive and using a ramdisk on
   the CD or hard drive, while still loading the installation packages from
   the CD (the default). (See the instructions available online for yaBoot
   or BootX, the Linux/PPC boot loaders; yaBoot is currently
   better-supported on the newest machines.)

   typical environments include: Internet server farms, high performance
   clusters, computer labs, or corporate desktop environments where all

   The root filesystem from SHARP is known for its weird structure with
   symbolic links all over the place.
   
   The custom compile worked. Remember to hit the "/"-key when the Zaurus
   displays "Wait... ", so you can choose to start a login instead of QTopia,
   which is not available then. Unless you downloaded QTopia, (cross-)compiled
   it and installed it into the root filesystem.
   BTW, you can create a new user with "adduser", a command provided by BusyBox.

   tries to create the same environment as the one from SHARP, but
   based upon free software only.
   
   At the moment, it still uses the old kernel from Sharp, but slightly
   modified in regards of usage of the FLASH-ROM as RAM and division of RAM
   between RAMDISK and RAM. Unfortunately, the driver for the SD-controller is
   binary-only and thus non-free. But also SHARP itself tries to convince the
   vendor, SDCA, to provide the sources for the public.
   
   Moreover, 
   <A
HREF="http://openzaurus.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>OpenZaurus</A
>
   created a sane root-filesystem we all know from our
   regular Linux systems. It also replaces QTopia by 
   <A
HREF="http://opie.handhelds.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Open Palmtop Integrated Environment - OPIE</A
>
   , which
   is a fork from QTopia with no relations to Trolltech anymore. All
   applications from QTopia should run on OPIE, but not quite: The Doom-like
   game called Zraycast does not run on OPIE, but does on QTopia (more or less).
   
   You can download a ready zimage, bootflag and initrd directly or checkout the
   sources from CVS. The downloaded images worked fine.

   <A
HREF="http://www.busybox.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>BusyBox</A

   , which makes it a little bit easier. The maintainer has therefore
   stripped down some more tools to fit them into the Flash-ROM.
   It uses the kernel provided by 
   <A
HREF="http://openzaurus.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>OpenZaurus</A
>
   and thus the one from Sharp.
   There are some issues with the RAMdisk, calibration of the stylus and
   sleep / power-off/-on.
   
   As soon as it is in a more stable state, it will join forces with 
   <A
HREF="http://emdebian.sourceforge.net/"

   and the sources will become available (probably already furnished upon
   request). The downloaded images still have to be tweaked. :)
   
   All systems, including the sources from SHARP, are set to use the US
   keyboard layout (or the German keyboard). It seems that the keymap
   available is fixed in the kernel and there are no user-space tools
   installed per default to change this. Perhaps I will give the package
   "console-tools" on Debian a try.

   which explains the necessary steps for setup (Ethernet-over-USB). It is not
   quite up-to-date, because SHARP has tightened the security with their current
   ROM-release, so you have to give the IP-address 192.168.129.1 to your usb0
   network device.  You have to download and compile a patch for your kernel
   to use the driver usbdnet (see aforementioned website). Afterwards, a
   connection between the QTopia-Desktop and the Zaurus is possible.
   I had a lot of problems with the usb network layer on my system and could not
   sync properly. A switch from the driver uhci to usb-uhci for my host dit it.
   Just recently I had to reboot my notebook and the Zaurus due to a hiccup in
   the corresponding usb-net drivers. The network via an ethernet-card in the
   CF-slot is much more reliable than the connection via usb and you can still
   use the keyboard. The disadvantage is, that you cannot have a storage device
   in your CF-slot while you are on-line.

   There is a site which offers a 
   <A
HREF="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jpc1/linux/ipaq/serial.html"
TARGET="_top"
>serial keyboard driver and a patch for the iPAQ</A
>
   .  Since the iPAQ and the Zaurus are based on the same CPU architecture,
   StrongArm, I hope that the driver provided there will also work on the
   Zaurus.  You also need a user-space tool called
   <B
CLASS="command"
>inputattach</B
>, which you can also get from there (source
   or binary for ARM).  I got a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite with a PS/2
   connector.  An adaptor translates to serial which itself is plugged into
   to the Collie serial &#60;-&#62; serial connector.  I do not know if this
   chain is even possible to work.  The provided patch applied with only one
   failing hunk which made a trivial change in the sources
   (include/linux/serio.h) necessary; check the output.  After having
   re-configured the SHARP kernel config and having compiled the modules, I
   transferred them to the Zaurus.  The modules marked and created are:
   newtonkbd.o, serio.o, serport.o and perhaps stowaway.o from
   drivers/char/joystick/ and input.o and keybdev.o from drivers/input/.
   When you start <B
CLASS="command"
>inputattach</B
>, you have to use the line
   <B
CLASS="command"
>inputattach --newtonkbd /dev/ttyS0</B
>, _not_ ttySA0 as
   stated on the website.  For some strange reason, the Collie serial driver
   does not comply to the official StrongARM documentation of the kernel,
   which states that the serial ports are accessible via /dev/ttySAx.  And
   because the serial_collie.o is already compiled into the Sharp kernel,
   you do not have to load the generic module serial.o.  Well, I also tried
   the serial_collie.o as a module, while it was still compiled into the
   kernel.  There were no complaints when loading it, but the system froze
   unpredictably, so I had to do a soft-reset quite often.  Why can I load a
   module whose code is already in the kernel, I wonder...  Anyway, it does
   not work.  :( I tried inputattach in the --dump mode (you have to
   undefine a variable in the source and recompile) and it seems that there
   is nothing happening between the serial port and the keyboard.  The call
   for select (man 2 select) fails due to a timeout.

  SL-5x00 series.  You can buy an adaptor to a regular serial interface from them, but
  unfortunately, the plug is very thick and you cannot open the slide for the
  keyboard anymore. Hopefully, you can still plug an external keyboard into this port!
  You can at least plug the power cord into the adaptor so you do not have to
  run on battery. There are third-party adaptors available, which overcome
  this caveat.

   wrote to the iPAQ mailing list:
   "We (Nicolas Pitre and myself) have successfully ported BRLTTY to the iPaq
   and tested the setup by interfacing with a BrailleLite 18 through the
   serial port.
   
   BRLTTY is a program that allows access to the Linux text-mode console
   using various brands of Braille displays.
   
   The BrailleLite is a small electronic Braille notetaker device which can
   act as a small refreshable Braille display. It also has keys so I can not
   only read but also type.
   
   So there's just the iPaq and the BrailleLite device (with a horrible
   cable in between) and that's all I need to fully use the console on
   the iPaq (in text-mode). A pretty powerful setup, yet very small.
   
   At the Ottawa Linux Symposium in July, using a network card in my iPaq
   and borrowing the internet connection they supplied, I was actually able
   to logon to the net and go read my E-mail, using ssh, pine and lynx!
   
   It should be possible to duplicate this setup with other Braille display
   models or other PDAs."

   is a set of libraries and utilities for enabling Unix (mainly Linux)
   systems to communicate with a Psion palmtop over a serial line. On Linux, a
   connection over IrDA, using the IrCOMM feature is also possible. A shared
   library encapsulates the highlevel protocol (PsionLinkProtocol) and thus
   makes it easy to write applications without extensive knowledge of the
   protocol itself. A daemon (ncpd) handles the serial connection and provides
   it's services on a local TCP socket.

>&#13;   Tablet PCs are a special kind of notebooks. Usually without keyboard
   (or equipped with an external and remote keyboard), they feature a touchscreen
   (therefore they were also named Pen PCs) and access to wireless LAN.
   In a certain sense they can be compared with PDAs. Microsoft has
   created a special edition of their operating system for Tablet PCs
   and published a so-called specification. In 2003 the first Tablet PCs 
   according to this specification entered the market. Though there
   have been appropriate devices with Linux many years before. See the
   <A
HREF="http://tuxmobil.org/touch_laptops.html"

>
   and the
   <A

>
   and finally a
   <A
HREF="http://tuxmobil.org/tablet_unix.html"
TARGET="_top"
>survey about Linux on Tablet PCs, WebPads, NotePads and PenPCs</A
>.
   They are used for data acquisition in stores, in the field or in
   hospitals. Or as a book reader or webbrowser (therefore they are also named
   WebPads). Their hardware features require some dedicated Linux
   solutions.

   is an open source project for the implementation of the 
   Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) for use with browsers, 
   servers and tools. WAP is used by PDA devices, cell phones, 
   pagers and other wireless devices to transmit internet 
   content to these devices. The project is still in its 
   early stages and nothing can be downloaded yet.

   is a library to access GSM mobile phones through GSM modems. Features
   include: modification of phonebooks stored in the mobile phone or on
   the SIM card, reading and writing of SMS messages stored in the mobile
   phone, sending and reception of SMS messages. Additionally, some
   simple command line programs are provided to use these features.

   potential for WAP services, both from wireless operators and
   specialized service providers, will be realized as efficiently as
   possible.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Kannel also works as an SMS gateway for GSM networks. Almost all GSM
   phones can send and receive SMS messages, so this is a way to serve many
   more clients than just those using a new WAP phone.

   is a client/server software package that enables you to send messages
   to an alphanumeric pager. The client accepts a message from the user
   and forwards it to a server using SNPP. The server uses a modem to
   transmit the message to the recipient's paging service using the TAP
   protocol (also known as the IXO protocol).

   converts a (MIME) mail to a short message, allowing search/replace,
   conditional rules, date/time dependent actions, customizing the
   output format, etc. The output defaults to 160 characters, which is
   perfectly suitable for sending the text to a GSM telephone as an
   SMS message. This software does not include any code for actually
   sending the text to anything else but another program or stdout.

>email2sms</A
>
   is a filter written in Perl which converts an e-mail into a form
   suitable for sending as an SMS message. Its main advantage over
   the alternatives is that it uses the CPAN module
   <EM
>Lingua::EN::Squeeze</EM
> to compress the text
   down to as little as 40% of its original size, so you can
   get much more of your e-mail into the 160 character limit imposed
   by SMS. It is fully MIME compatible, and has many configurable
   options, including removal of quoted text. Ideal for use with
   procmail. A Perl script for sending the output to a typical
   e-mail to SMS web gateway is included.

   implements a client/server gateway to the SMS protocol.
   It requires the use of dedicated hardware though (a
   serial GSM module). Both SMS emission and reception are supported. The
   server only runs under Linux at the present time and also supports
   interactive mode via <B

   already exists for Linux, Solaris and HP-UX. A basic web interface is
   provided. A Win32 client is in the works.

>&#13;   Before setting up any hardware you should have a look into the BIOS.
   Often you may find a solution already there, e.g. options to set up 
   the display,
   APM or ACPI,
   DMA,
   IrDA,
   PCMCIA,
   sound,
   SpeedStep,
   and more.



</P
><P
>&#13;   If you run into unresolvable trouble when configuring the hardware,
   try a BIOS upgrade from the manufacturer. For this task you
   usually need one of the Microsoft so-called operating systems. Or
   at least a DOS disk or CD.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Flashing BIOSes has become often quite complex as both DOS and floppies
   are fading away. Things aren't any easier when running exclusively
   GNU/Linux. Luckily, it is possible to 
   <A
HREF="http://freshrpms.net/docs/bios-flash/"

>create a bootable CD-ROM</A

   with GNU/Linux, which enables one to actually flash a BIOS using a DOS utility
   without requiring Windows, MS-DOS or a floppy drive.
</P

   aims to replace the normal BIOS found on PCs, Alphas, and
   other machines with a Linux kernel that can boot Linux from a cold
   start. LinuxBIOS is primarily Linux - about 10 lines of patches to the
   current Linux kernel.  Additionally, the startup code - about 500

   patch for the linux-2.4/2.5 kernels:
   
   CPU clock frequency scaling for Linux, on x86 and ARM based
   processors. This module provides a user-space and standard kernel-space
   interface to this feature, along ARM system-on-a-chip devices to cope
   with processor clock changes. 
   
   Since the power consumed by a processor is directly related to the
   speed at which it is running, keeping the clock speed as low as
   possible allows you to get more run-time out of your battery. Some
   people use this to adjust their clock speed many times a second to
   optimise performance vs battery life. See also the

   that will make your CPU run cooler? Sounds
   pretty strange, huh? Let me explain: Have you ever thought of the
   fact that your CPU is idle most of the time when you're using
   your computer? For example, when you're using your word
   processor, writing emails, browsing the web, the CPU does nothing
   else than just wait for user input. In fact, it will use up to
   30W and produce substantial amounts of heat doing
   nothing.
   
   Good operating systems, like Linux, NT and OS/2 have a
   so-called "idle loop" - a loop that's always executed when
   the CPU has nothing to do. This loop consists of halt
   (HLT) instructions. 
   
   CPUs like the AMD K6, the Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX have a
   special feature called "suspend-on-halt". This means
   that everytime the CPU executes a hlt instruction, it
   will go into "suspend mode" for a short time. So, while
   the idle loop is being executed, the CPU will be in
   suspend mode, use much less power, and stay much cooler.
   
   Of course, this does not affect performance at all!
   The user won't even notice that his CPU is in suspend
   mode most of the time (unless he touches the
   heatsink).

   These cards are difficult to get, but some desktop WLAN PCI cards contain miniPCI cards. Often it is a tedious task to
   build them into a laptop. Kernel maintainer Theodore Tytso has written a 
   <A
HREF="http://www.thunk.org/tytso/linux/t40.html"
TARGET="_top"

   use a wireless PCMCIA or CF card
   instead. This solution may provide more flexibility, because you may use a PCMCIA or
   CF card in different devices and choose the Linux driver of your choice. You may also extend the wireless range by
   adding antennas to some cards. For Linux compatibility there is the

>12.4.4. Conclusion</H2

>&#13;   Though Linux support is not yet complete, some features of the Centrino(TM) technology already make it worthwhile to
   take into account when buying your next laptop. Though the new CPUs are named so similarly to existing ones that some
   people mix them up, they are completely different inside. Compared to the Pentium-4 Mobile CPU, the Pentium-M will
   allow a smaller form factor for laptops, making them more portable and lighter. Because of their higher clockspeed,
   the Pentium-4 CPUs have produced too much heat to build them into slimline notebook cases. Therefore, very flat
   notebooks have only been available from Apple or with a Pentium III Mobile CPU. Also, the battery power the Pentium-M
   consumes for a given level of performance will decrease, but I do not have a benchmark about how much the savings
   actually are yet. PENN Computing offers a nice

   Usually there are no problems with Linux and the keyboard.
   Though there are two minor caveats: First the
   <B
CLASS="command"
>setleds</B
> program might not work. Second the
   key mapping might not fit your needs. Some
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>UNIX</SPAN
> users and <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> users
   expect to find the &#60;CONTROL&#62; key to the left of the
   &#60;A&#62; key. Many PC-type keyboards have the
   &#60;CAPS-LOCK&#62; key there. You may use
   <B
CLASS="command"
>xmodmap</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>loadkeys</B
> to
   re-map the keyboard. Some laptops (e.g., Toshiba) allow you
   to swap the &#60;CAPS-LOCK&#62; and &#60;CONTROL&#62; keys. Mark
   Alexander offered this solution in the linux-laptop mailing
   list: On RedHat, it's a one-line patch to
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map</TT
> , or
   whatever file is referenced in

   The function key (often labelled Fn on the key) is usually used to
   switch on a simulated numeric keyboard, which is provided as a separate
   keypad on desktop keyboards. For those who don't want to use the
   simulation there are additional external numeric keypads
   available for PS/2 ports and I suppose USB ports.
   
   Also the function key may be used in combination with some F-keys to
   change display brightness, adjust the speaker volume or mute them,
   lock the keyboard, switch between external and internal display, use
   different suspend modes and more.  Sometimes these key combinations
   work out of the box with Linux. Some require dedicated tools, for
   these tools see the Hotkey chapter above.

   The power key often has different functions, besides power on and
   off it may be used to wake up the machine from suspend mode.
   This is usually achieved by pressing the power button for just a
   few seconds only. If you press it longer (app. more than 5 seconds)
   it will power down fully.

   With modern laptops supporting ACPI it's also possible to

>&#13;   It is important to remember that the HID driver handles those devices
   (or actually those interfaces on each device) that claim to comply with
   the Human Interface Device (HID) specification. However the HID
   specification doesn't say anything about what the HID driver should do
   with information received from a HID device, or where the information
   that is sent to a device comes from, since this is obviously dependent
   on what the device is supposed to be doing, and what the operating
   system is. Linux (at the operating system kernel level) supports four
   interfaces to a HID device - keyboard, mouse, joystick and a generic
   interface, known as the event interface.

   This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
   a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N.
   Though the default seems to be Y. So it may be enabled if you are
   unaware.
   I have got reports that SMP support enabled does interfere with APM.
   So with a single CPU machine like a laptop you are on the save side,
   when you N.

   into suspend or standby mode. An  interrupt  from  the  RTC  causes the
   computer to wake-up.  The program detects this event, by waiting for a
   leap  in  the kernel  time  and terminates successfully. If no time leap
   occurs within one minute, or something  goes wrong, the exit value will

   enables the possibility of suspending a machine. It doesn't need APM.
   You may suspend your machine by either pressing Sysrq-d or with

CLASS="command"
>swsusp</B

CLASS="command"
>shutdown -z</B
> (patch for

   saved in your active swaps. By the next booting the kernel detects the
   saved image, restores the memory from it and then it continues to run
   as before you've suspended. If you don't want the previous state to
   continue use the <B
CLASS="command"
>noresume</B
> kernel option. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   Software suspends may even be better than hibernate, because now I can
   suspend my Linux system, boot into Microsoft Windows, perform a few
   illegal operations and be shut down, and then restart my Linux setup
   exactly where I left off! This is something that cannot be done with
   hibernation, since that always restores the last state that you
   suspended from, be it Microsoft Windows or Linux. So if I want to switch
   to Microsoft Windows to play games or do anything else, I can leave my
   Linux desktop exactly as it is and return to how I left it.

   (modified by WH): Discharge the battery. If your
   battery runs only for about 20 minutes, you probably
   suffer from memory effects. Most laptops do not
   discharge the battery properly. With low powered
   devices like old computer fans they can be discharged
   completely. This removes memory effects. You should
   do so even with LiIon batteries, though they don't
   suffer much from memory effect (the manual of
   an <SPAN

   to cycle the batteries through a full
   charge/discharge cycle 3 times every few

As a first step, Intel has released PowerTOP, a tool that helps you find what
software is using the most power. By fixing (or closing) these applications or
processes, you can immediately see the power savings in the tool. You'll also
see the estimated time left for battery power if you are running a laptop. The

>&#13;   I don't use a docking station myself. They seem really expensive and I can't
   see any usefulness. Alright you have to deal with some more cables, but is
   it worth so much money? Docking stations are useful in an office
   environment when you have a permanent network connection, or need the
   docking station's expansion bus slots (e.g. for some excotic SCSI device).
</P

>&#13;   Also all docking stations I know are proprietary models, so if you
   change your laptop you have to change this device, too. I just found
   one exception a docking station which connects to your laptop via

   Mouse; 25-Pin Printer Port (LPT); IR Transceiver; Power (6 VDC). So it
   seems that a VGA port and a port to connect a desktop PC directly are
   missing. This device should work with Linux/<SPAN

   and an external keyboard and mouse. If your laptop supports an extra
   PS/2 port you may use a cheap solution a <EM

   which connects the PS/2 port to an external keyboard and an external

   "The main problem with docking stations is getting the operating

   you can examine the devices available in <TT

   and thus detect a docked state. With
   this in mind a few simple scripts is all you need to get your machine
   configured correctly in a docked state.
</P
><P
>&#13;   You may want to build support for the docking station hardware as
   modules instead of putting it directly into the kernel. This will save
   space in your kernel but your choice probably largely depends on how
   often you are docked.

P/N 83057 to check the Linux compatibility of such devices. Actually
this device should be named port replicator, because it does not have
any extension slots. 
This device doesn't have a VGA port to connect to an external
display. Only a few USB docking stations have this feature. It would
be nice to get a report whether a VGA port works or not.
Tested with laptop COMPAQ M700 (USB 1.1) and custom made kernel 2.6.1.
Note the port replicator didn't work with
an Apple PowerBook G4.

>&#13;   There are three kinds of modems available: internal,
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> card or external serial port modems. But
   some internal modems will not work with Linux these modems are usually
   called WinModem. This is caused by non-standard hardware. So you have to use either a
   <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> card modem or an external modem (serial or USB). The 
   <A
HREF="http://walbran.org/sean/linux/linmodem-howto.html"

   provide a survey about the modem controllers used in different laptops.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Quotation from the Kernel-FAQ: "9.Why aren't WinModems supported? (REG,
   quoting Edward S. Marshall) The problem is the lack of specifications
   for this hardware. Most companies producing so-called
   <EM
>WinModems</EM
> refuse to provide specifications which
   would allow non-Microsoft operating systems to use them. The basic
   issue is that they don't work like a traditional modem; they don't
   have a DSP, and make the CPU do all the work. Hence, you can't talk
   to them like a traditional modem, and you -need- to run the modem
   driver as a realtime task, or you'll have serious data loss issues
   under any kind of load. They're simply a poor design."
</P
><P
>&#13;   "<EM
>Win</EM
> modems are lobotomized modems which expect
   Windows to do some of their thinking for them. If you do not have
   Windows, you do not have a connection. "
</P
><P
>&#13;   Anyway, I have set up a page collecting information on laptops with internal modems at 
   <A
HREF="http://tuxmobil.org/hardware.html"
TARGET="_top"
>TuxMobil - Hardware</A

   . Maybe it's possible to run such modems with MS-Windows9x/NT 
   emulators like <B
CLASS="command"

   You can't connect an analog modem to an ISDN port and vice versa. Though

   connected to the serial port, a daemon that decodes and sends IR
   signals using this device driver, a mouse daemon that translates IR

   It prints either black, or color (3 color). I have had some problems

   All of them work very well together with Linux. Especially I like
   the cases for 2.5" hard disks, you may upgrade your current laptop
   hard disk and use the old one to put it into the external box to
   extend your hard disk space.
</P

>&#13;   Caveat: After wake up from suspend mode, the external hard drive
   can't work. To cure this problem these remedies might help:

   Disconnect the external drive and then plug it in again.

   Or use an AC adapter to power the external drive. Though this seems
   unconvenient in a suspend situation. But since the external drive
   gets the power from the adapter, there is no disconnection from
   power as will be if power is provided from USB.

><P
>&#13;   You probably wonder, why I include this topic here. But shortly after
   using my COMPAQ Armada 1592DT I recognized that the rear side of the
   machine (where the ports are arranged) was slightly damaged. Though I
   have taken much care when transporting the laptop, this was caused by
   putting the bag on the floor. It seems that the laptop has so much
   weight, that it bounces inside the bag on its own rear side. So I
   decided to put a soft pad into the bag before loading the laptop. A good
   bag is highly recommended if you take your laptop on trips, or take it
   home every night.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Laptops computers are frequently demolished in their carrying bag. The
   two main causes of demolition are poking the LC display and banging the
   edges. A good case has very stiff sides to spread out pokes, and lots of
   energy-absorbent padding around the edges to help when you whack it on
   the door jamb. Few cases actually have either of these features.

   PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) is an
   international standards body and trade association with over 200 member companies
   that was founded in 1989 to establish standards for Integrated Circuit cards and to
   promote interchangeability among mobile computers where ruggedness, low power,
   and small size were critical. As the needs of mobile computer users have changed, so
   has the PC Card Standard. By 1991, PCMCIA had defined an I/O interface for the
   same 68 pin connector initially used for memory cards. At the same time, the Socket
   Services Specification was added and was soon followed by the Card Services
   Specifcation as developers realized that common software would be needed to
   enhance compatibility.
   "</SPAN

   The cards are available in different formats: Type I, II, III.

   "PCMCIA (PC Card) support is now partially implemented in the main
   kernel source. Pay attention when you recompile your kernel.  If you
   need to use the <B

   the kernel's PCMCIA support. If you don't need to use the PCMCIA-CS
   modules (i.e. all the drivers you need are in the kernel sources), then
   don't compile them; you won't need anything in there.  Also, be sure to

>&#13;CONFIG_HOTPLUG
  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly. In many
  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers. Another
  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel. Get 
  <A
HREF="http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>agent software</A
>
  and install it. Then your kernel will automatically call out to a
  user mode "policy agent" (<B
CLASS="command"
>/sbin/hotplug</B
>) to
  load modules and set up software needed to use devices as
  you hotplug them.

   : "The term <EM

   describes the ability of a host that is able to move its network
   connection from one point on the Internet to another without changing
   its IP address or losing connectivity. Usually when an IP host changes
   its point of connectivity it must also change its IP address. IP
   Mobility overcomes this problem by allocating a fixed IP address to the
   mobile host and using IP encapsulation (tunneling) with automatic
   routing to ensure that datagrams destined for it are routed to the
   actual IP address it is currently using."

><P
>&#13;   From Martin J. Evans
   
   I have taken this recommendation: The first point to note is that
   <B
CLASS="command"
>init</B
> will take any arguments of the form
   <B
CLASS="command"
>name=value</B
> as environment variable assignments if
   they are not recognized as something else. This means you can set
   environment variables from the LILO boot prompt before your rc scripts
   run. I set the <B
CLASS="command"
>LOCATION</B
> environment variable
   depending on where I am when I boot Linux. e.g.

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;LILO: linux LOCATION=home
</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

   Or

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;LILO: linux LOCATION=work
</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

   Or simply

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;LILO: linux
</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

   where failing to set <B
CLASS="command"
>LOCATION</B
> means the same as
   <B
CLASS="command"
>LOCATION=home</B
> (i.e. my default). Instead of typing
   <B
CLASS="command"
>LOCATION=place</B
> each time you boot you can add an
   entry to your <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
> file and use the
   append instruction. e.g.

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;# Linux bootable partition for booting Linux at home
#
image = /vmlinuz
root = /dev/hda3
label = linux
read-only
# Linux bootable partition config ends
#
# Linux bootable partition for booting Linux at work
#
image = /vmlinuz
root = /dev/hda3
label = work
read-only
append="LOCATION=work"
# Linux bootable partition config ends
</PRE

   With the example above you can use "linux" 
   for booting at home and "work" for booting at work.
</P

>&#13;   Armed with the facility above, you can now edit the relevant rc scripts

>&#13;   This looks more complicated as it is. All it does is, that it redirectes
   outbound mail to server1 (SMART_HOST) and also mail for local users
   which are not known (LUSER_RELAY). That way, I can write email to my
   colleques without using their full email address. More important: the
   From line in my email points back to my MASQUARADE_AS domain and not
   directly to my laptop. If this where not the case, email returned with

>unison</A

   is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and
   Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories
   to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
   modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
   changes in each replica to the other.
   Unison was written by researchers with an eye for well-defined
   replication semantics: they were very fussy about safety, and made
   sure to handle gracefully things like premature termination etc.
   Unison is symmetric/bidirectional (unlike rsync), works fine with
   binaries (unlike cvs), and is a user-level program (unlike most
   distributed filesystems).  It also makes a reasonable attempt to
   synchronize transparently between Unix/Linux and Windows filesystems,
   which is no small feat.  Drawbacks: it does not do version control,
   and does not handle synchronization among more than 2 file trees.

   primary target of development is to provide
   support for flexible replication of directories,
   with disconnected operation and a persistent
   cache.  For example, we want to make it easy to
   manage copies of home directories on multiple
   computers, and solve the laptop/desktop
   synchronization problems. On a larger scale we aim
   to provide replication of large file repositories,
   for example to support high availability for
   servers.  InterMezzo was deeply inspired
   by the Coda File System, but totally
   re-designed and re-engineered.

>15.6. Connections to Servers</H1
><P
>&#13;   From Dirk Janssen &#60;dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu&#62;: Here are several good
   ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a
   separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a
   terminal server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and
   the better keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The
   easiest way to do this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from
   your desktop (running X) to the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure
   connection and, crucially, a secure X connection between the two
   machines. If you type, for example, <B
CLASS="command"
>emacs &#38;</B
> in
   the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while
   running on your laptop. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   There are various ways in which you can make this situation more
   productive/complicated. Emacs, for one thing, can open windows (called
   frames by emacs) on separate displays by using
   <B
CLASS="command"
>make-frame-on-display</B
>. This way, you can have the
   same emacs displaying on your desktop and your laptop: A dual headed
   system is born. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   For other programs, you usually have to decide at startup time on which
   screen you want them. To run them on the laptop screen, start them as
   usual. To run them on the desktop screen, start them from the ssh shell
   on the desktop or redirect their screens using the DISPLAY variable.
   Some programs also accept a <B
CLASS="command"
>-display</B
> option. Read the
   documentation on <B
CLASS="command"
>xauth</B
> on how to set this up. An easy
   way out is to find out which pseudo display ssh has created for you by
   typing <B
CLASS="command"
>echo $DISPLAY</B
> in the ssh shell. Assuming your
   desktop is called <B
CLASS="command"
>olli</B
> and your laptop
   <B
CLASS="command"
>stan</B
>, this will usually produce something like
   <B
CLASS="command"
>stan:10</B
>. This means that processes on stan (the
   laptop) display on what they think is the 10th screen of stan, which by
   some ssh magic is actually relayed (in a secure way) to the screen of
   olli.
</P
><P
>&#13;   There are some ways in which you can dynamically move windows from one
   machine to another. A very interesting approach is taken by
   <B
CLASS="command"
>xmove</B
>, but this program lacks a good user interface
   (any volunteers?). Xmove creates a pseudo screen (similar to the stan:10
   that ssh creates) and windows that have their DISPLAY set to this pseudo
   screen can be moved back and forth between real screens (provided all
   screens use the same color depth).
</P
><P
>&#13;   Alternatively, you can run an one of the several programs that open a
   <B
CLASS="command"
>virtual root window</B
>: A window on your desktop that
   contains other windows. It looks a lot like running an emulator. With
   these programs, you can start your processes on stan, then move all
   their windows to olli, then work for a while, and then move them back so
   you can continue working on stan. Hibernate your laptop and repeat ad
   infinitum. Check out xmx and VNC for this. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   If this is all too complicated for you, but you like to use the two
   screens at the same time, consider at least installing x2x. This little
   tool makes it possible to move your mouse from one screen to the other,
   and the keyboard focus goes with it. To run it, you need another ssh
   going from stan (the laptop) to olli (the desktop): ie. type
   <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh olli</B
> in a stan xterm. Keep this shell running and
   find out which pseudo screen was created with <B
CLASS="command"
>echo
   $DISPLAY</B
>. This will return something like
   <B
CLASS="command"
>olli:10</B
> (see above for explanation). Now, type this
   in any shell on olli: <B
CLASS="command"
>x2x -west -to olli:10</B
> (and I
   mean, in a shell that runs on olli and displays on olli, not an ssh
   shell) This creates a little black band to on the left (west) side of
   your desktop's screen. Whenever you move the mouse over this, the mouse
   on screen olli:10 will move. Because olli:10 is just an ssh-created
   alias for the screen of stan, the mouse on your laptop will move and you
   can type there by only moving your head, not your hands.
</P
><P
>&#13;   A note on X-security: Playing around with various screen programs is
   much easier if you issue an <B
CLASS="command"
>xhost +</B
> on either
   computer. But this is extremely unsafe. Do this only when you are not
   connected to any larger network. If you have everything working, spend
   some time on getting xauth to work. If you use xdm, it is usually easy.
   Otherwise, consider starting your Xserver with the same magic cookie all
   the time. This is less safe, but still pretty safe, and it means that
   you have to copy the cookies only once. Check the startup scripts
   (.xserverrc, .xinitrc, .xsession, etc) for something like
   <B
CLASS="command"
>cookie="MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 `keygen`"</B
> and change that
   into (invent your own cookie here): <B
CLASS="command"
>cookie="MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
   12345678901234567890abcdefabcdef"</B
>

   any good trophy shop. They'll glue it on for you too. You could use
   double-sided tape instead, but glue is more permanent. So it's easy to
   return, but will look beaten and abused if these are removed. You may
   even make an engravement into the laptop cover (inside). And even better
   into every removable part (hard disk, battery, CD/DVD drive, power
   unit).  If this machine ever gets to a repair office, I might get the
   machine back.  Make sure you remember to update the plates if you move.

>&#13;   In the case somebody unplugs the machine while under the xlock (without
   giving the password), then the daemon would detect it and could start
   doing some preventive action, such as:
   - playing a sound with maximum volume saying "I am getting stolen".
   - this daemon could also register to a fixed local server and do a ping
   every now and then. If the ping stops before the daemon unregister to
   the server, then server then can take other actions, such as sending
   SMS message, starting a video camera, in the room, etc.  The apm

>&#13;   There are a few reasons which might make it necessary to
   put Micorosoft DOS/Windows and Linux together on one laptop. Often the support for
   the flash ROM of <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>PCMCIA</SPAN
> cards and modems is not
   available for Linux, or you have to retrieve hardware information, which
   is not visible with Linux, due to a lack of support by some hardware
   manufacturers. I'm not sure whether these tasks can be performed under an
   emulation like DOS-EMU, WINE or VMware.

>&#13;   If you want Linux with X11, Netscape, etc., and
   Microsoft-Windows9x,NT,2000,XP things will be tight in a 1GB harddisk.

>&#13;   Often you get a preinstalled version of Microsoft-Windows on your laptop. If you
   just want to shrink the Windows partition, you need a tool to resize
   the partition. Or you can remove the partition first, repartition, then
   reinstall. Most of the following information I found at the page of

   <B

   drives (Drivespace, etc.). For long file names use

>&#13;   Repairing a laptop can be quite expensive if you don't have a
   manufacturer's warranty. Sometimes professional support is bad. But
   opening a laptop case can be difficult. Often the procedures to upgrade
   the memory and the harddisk are described in the manual. For further
   details, you should try to get the maintenance/technical manual. Just
   be extremely careful and make notes as to where each screw goes. You
   must get most of them back in the right hole or you could ruin the
   machine by damaging the system board. Also after you get all the screws
   to an assembly out (some will be hidden) the parts are usually held
   together with plastic clips molded in, so you still must exercise care
   to separate them. Sometimes you need certain tools, for instance TORX
   screw drivers or a solder kit. Good luck.

   support for many graphics cards, sound cards, SCSI and
   USB devices and other peripherals. KNOPPIX can be used
   as a Linux demo, educational CD, rescue system, or
   adapted and used as a platform for commercial software
   product demos.  It is not necessary to install anything
   on a hard disk.  Due to on-the-fly decompression, the CD
   can have up to 2 GB of executable software installed on
   it.  A kix (Knoppix mini CD) is now available in the

   is a very small Linux distribution that fits on one floppy disk.
   You need at least a 386 machine (FPU not necessary) with 8 mb ram to run
   HAL91. The entire system runs in ram, so you can remove the floppy after
   booting. The kernel supports IDE hard disks and ATAPI cdrom drives.
   Supported filesystems are ext2, iso9660 and vfat, optional encryption using
   AES is possible. Limited support for ethernet cards (NE2000 only) is also
   included. Support for scsi adapters, parallel zip drive and other ethernet
   cards is possible by loading kernel modules from an optional package.

   by Erich Boehm is a full featured linux system running on Intel PC's. The special thing is 
   that DLX comes with only one 3,5" floppydisk. DLX boots with a kernel &#62;= 1.3.89 and 
   starts a ramdisk image. In addition to that DLX also has a writeable ext2 
   filesystem of about 130 kb on the same disk to easily store configuration 
   scripts (survives booting, is not on the ramdisk !). Further is DLX fully 
   prepared for the paralell-port ZIP-Drive which allows you to mount 100 mb 
   disks. You can even put large programs like perl5 on the disk 
   because a special directory on the ZIP-disk is mounted as /usr/local/*!

   creates a bootable X Windows system
   that fits on two 1.44 MB floppies. The kernel (2.0.26) 
   includes networking (PPP and dialin script, NE2000, 
   3C509) and the driver for the parallel port ZIP drive as
   modules. The file system contains pppd, rlogin, tar 
   and ncftp and a small X Windows system. Requires a 
   Linux system (with 2.0.0 kernel or above) to create the 
   2 floppies.  The cramdisk floppy set will boot to "xdm" 
   on a 486/pentium with 16MB RAM.  For networking, the IP 
   addresses and/or ppp dialin sequence need to be set. 
   A method for modifying the floppy image is included.

>&#13;   Here are some comments and thoughts by Nat Makarevitch 
   
   about a possible approach which may
   reduce the disk activity under Linux (sparing energy, especially with
   noflushd) the file Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt of the Linux sourcetree
   documents some useful features, esp. in the 
   <TT
CLASS="filename"

   Under Linux 2.2 I used:

   especially under Linux 2.4 which uses its spare time to 'pre-save' the
   less-used memory pages into the swap, increasing the disk activity
   
   I tried to figure the more adequate parameters (Linux 2.4.9, 192 MB RAM,
   Toshiba 3480 laptop)
   
   beware: some of those parameters may be dangerous or useless (I have not
   gathered serious data about the practical efficiency).  moreover do not
   forget that delaying disk writes of data is intrinsically dangerous

>&#13;   Some more words about
   disks spin down with <B
CLASS="command"
>noflushd</B
> or
   <B
CLASS="command"
>hdparm</B
> utilities. The objective
   is to reduce hard disk usage to minimum, because on most laptops it
   is the primary source of noise and energy consumption. The "noflushd" daemon is a
   replacement of "update" which makes buffer updates on disk only when
   some other data is being read from the disk (the behavior of "update"
   is to flush buffers every 5 seconds, and it usually generates
   constant disk activity, so that the disk never becomes idle).
   "noflushd" also sets the disk spindown time and automatically calls
   "sync" before spindown.  The syntax is something like "noflushd -n 5
   /dev/hda". Using "noflushd" may cause loss of data if some files were
   edited while the disk was parked and not sync'ed, e.g. if the power
   was suddenly lost.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The <B
CLASS="command"
>hdparm</B
> utility can set the sleep time too, and also tune the
   IDE disk parameters for better performance. Make sure that the
   kernel IDE parameter "Use DMA by default when available" (section
   "Block devices") is enabled.
</P
><P
>&#13;   However, it is not enough to enable <B
CLASS="command"
>noflushd</B
>
   or IDE disk sleep time to make the disk 
   effectively silent, because the system in most
   default installations is running many cron jobs, writes to log files,
   uses swap and so on. This activity is not always desirable,
   especially if the computer is standalone (not on network) and is used
   mostly by one user.  Here are some recommendations.
</P
><P
>&#13;   First, the cron daemon and friends (anacron, atd, logrotate,
   sendmail / exim / ...) could be removed from the system if the
   services they run (such as, cleaning /tmp directories and logs,
   checking email etc.) are not needed.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Secondly, the syslogd configuration file
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/syslog.conf</TT
> should
   be modified to reduce the number of log files and messages
   logged, and also to have "-" signs before every file name (which
   means that the system will not have to sync the disk every time a
   message is logged).
</P
><P
>&#13;   Also, it is advisable to add "mark:none;" to the "syslog" strings,
   so that the "strich strich strich MARK strich strich strich"
   messages do not get written to the log files every half an hour.
   Typical Linux installations today have too many log files for the
   home user.
</P
><P
>&#13;   Finally, the disk may not go to sleep when a lot of swap space is
   in use. Type "free" and see how much swap is being used and how
   much free RAM is available. If you think there is enough free RAM
   to work without swap, or if there is a lot of swap used AND also
   a lot of free RAM, consider freeing the swap space ("su; swapoff
   -a; swapon -a") or switching the swap space off altogether ("su;
   swapoff -a"). Working without swap should be fine on systems with
   64MB or more of RAM.  (Working without swap will reduce the
   available memory, of course, and some software crashes without
   warning when it runs out of memory. But, adding swap will not
   prevent the crash resulting from some runaway memory consumuing
   software, it will only delay it, and it will make the system swap
   a lot before it happens.)
</P
><P
>&#13;   With these changes in the system, one could get the laptop to
   work for extended periods of time with its hard disk switched
   off.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The kernel can be configured with "Yes" to "APM Support" and
   "Enable console blanking using APM" (section "General setup").
   Then the LCD screen lamp will shut off in console mode (so not
   just the screen goes black, but also the lamp). In X mode, the
   same effect can be obtained with "xset +dpms" (enable DPMS
   function) and "xset s blank" (enable screen blanking). One can
   add these commands to the X window session or window manager
   initialization scripts.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The computer's BIOS energy savings options (hard disk sleep
   time, video blanking time and so on) are probably not
   useful and in some cases may even cause crashes.  Therefore
   they could be disabled in the laptop's BIOS.

   energy consumption of different computer types along the life cycle. The
   production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % less than 4
   years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer is used
   for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new
   computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the
   stand-bye-mode still 100 Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80
   Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 Watt. Therefore from the

   that didn't need the energy for a new production and which
   consumes less electricity while it is being used.

><P
>&#13;   The NeoMagic graphics chipset series NM20xx has been popular in
   laptops build around 1996.
   For a long time this graphics chip was only supported by commercial X11 servers,
   since the middle of 1998 RedHat provided a binary X11 server
   manufactured by PrecisionInsight. Since version 3.3.3 the appropriate 
   X11 server is also available in XFree86.

>G.2. Textmode 100x37</H1
><P
>&#13;   This chapter is a courtesy of Cedric Adjih 
 
   , though I have changed some minor parts. Please note: Another method to
   achieve a better resolution in text mode is the use of the framebuffer
   driver (as explained in the X-Windows chapter above). This method
   requires kernel reconfiguration (some Linux distributions include an
   appropriate kernel already) and a new entry (vga=NNN) in
   <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/lilo.conf</TT
>. In text mode it works even with
   VESA BIOSes before version 2.0, at least on the models I could test it.
   Though the SVGATextMode method could be faster (couldn't check this
   yet).
</P
><P
>&#13;   An apparently little known fact about the Neomagic chipset NM20xx is
   that you can run text mode in 100x37 (i.e. 800x600). This text mode is
   very nice (as opposed to the 80x25 which is ugly). I tried this with a
   HP OmniBook 800 and suppose it might work with other laptops using the
   NeoMagic chip, too.
</P
><P
>&#13;   The main problem is that is a bit difficult to set up, and if you're
   going wrong with the commands <B
CLASS="command"
>SVGATextMode</B
>
   or <B
CLASS="command"
>restoretextmode</B

"Scott Mueller goes where no computer book author has gone before right past all 
the warranty stickers, the hidden screws, and the fear factor to produce a 
real owner's manual that every laptop owner should have on his desk. 
This book shows the upgrades users can perform, the ones that are 
better left to the manufacturer, and how to use add-on peripherals 
to make the most of a laptop. The CD contains one-of-a-kind 
video showing just what's inside a portable PC."

>&#13;Chris Hurley, Michael Puchol, Russ Rogers, Frank Thornton: WarDriving - Drive, Detect, Defend, A Guide to Wireless Security, 2004
</P
><P
>&#13;
From the Publisher: 
"Wardriving has brought some of the top people in the wireless industry
together to put together a truly informative book on what wardriving is
and the tools that should be part of any IT department's arsenal that
either has wireless or is looking to deploy it." -John Kleinschmidt,
Michiganwireless.org Founder

The practice of WarDriving is a unique combination of hobby, sociological
research, and security assessment. The act of driving or walking through
urban areas with a wireless-equipped laptop to map both protected and
un-protected wireless networks has sparked intense debate amongst
lawmakers, security professionals, and the telecommunications industry.
This first ever book on WarDriving is written from the inside perspective
of those who have created the tools that make WarDriving possible and
those who gather, analyze, and maintain data on all secured and open
wireless access points in very major, metropolitan area worldwide. These
insiders also provide the information to secure your wireless network
before it is exploited by criminal hackers.

Wireless networks have become a way of life in the past two years. As more
wireless networks are deployed the need to secure them increases. This book
educates users of wireless networks as well as those who run the networks
about the insecurities associated with wireless networking. This effort is
called WarDriving. In order to successfully WarDrive there are hardware and
software tool required. This book covers those tools, along with cost
estimates and recommendations. Since there are hundreds of possible
configurations that can be used for WarDriving, some of the most popular are
presented to help readers decide what to buy for their own WarDriving setup.

Many of the tools that a WarDriver uses are the same tools that could be used
by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a wireless network. Since this
is not the goal of a WarDriver, the methodology that users can use to
ethically WarDrive is presented. In addition, complete coverage of WarDriving
applications, such as NetStumbler, MiniStumbler; and Kismet, are covered."

>&#13;Isidor Buchmann: Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers, 2001
</P
><P
>&#13;From the Publisher: 
"Batteries in a Portable World fills a definite need for practical
information about rechargeable batteries. Quite often, performance
specifications for batteries and chargers are based on ideal
conditions. Manufacturers carry out battery tests on brand new
equipment and in a protected environment, removed from the stress of
daily use. In Batteries in a Portable World, Mr. Buchmann observes the
battery in everyday life in the hands of the common user. By reading
Batteries in a Portable World, you will acquire a better understanding
of the strengths and limitations of the battery. You will learn how to
prolong battery life; become familiar with recommended maintenance
methods and discover ways to restore a weak battery, if such a method
is available for that battery type. Knowing how to take care of your
batteries prolongs service life, improves reliability of portable
equipment and saves money. Best of all, well-performing batteries need
replacement less often, reducing the environmental concern of battery
disposal."

   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
   automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
   formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
   markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
   by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
   called "Opaque". 
</P

>&#13;   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
   using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
   designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
   PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary
   word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
   are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by
   some word processors for output purposes only.

>&#13;   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
   such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
   License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
   do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
   most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
   beginning of the body of the text.

>K.2.3. 2. VERBATIM COPYING</H2
><P
>&#13;   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
   the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
   conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
   of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

>K.2.4. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H2
><P
>&#13;   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
   the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
   Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
   back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as
   the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full
   title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
   add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
   limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
   Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
   copying in other respects. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
   them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

>K.2.5. 4. MODIFICATIONS</H2
><P
>&#13;   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
   Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
   filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
   modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
   In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: 
</P
><P
>&#13;   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
   should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
   Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
   original publisher of that version gives permission.
</P
><P
>&#13;   B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
   together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
   (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
</P
><P
>&#13;   C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
   Version, as the publisher. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
</P
><P
>&#13;E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
   of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it
   an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
   the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
   entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
   authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
   add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
   sentence. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
   network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
   based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a
   network location for a work that was published at least four years
   before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
   it refers to gives permission. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve
   the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and
   tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
   given therein. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
   their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
   not considered part of the section titles. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
   included in the Modified Version. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
   in title with any Invariant Section. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
   the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
   sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
   Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
   titles must be distinct from any other section titles. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
   Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
   made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text
   for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
   the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
   but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
   previous publisher that added the old one. 
</P
><P
>&#13;   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
