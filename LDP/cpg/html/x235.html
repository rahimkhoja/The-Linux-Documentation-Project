> Now that the console was working, we could see the real problems. The system wasn't booting yet. Since we were working with C code, we traced the code, and found that a function called <TT
CLASS="function"
>sdram_size()</TT
> wasn't completing correctly.  The function probed a register for the size of the RAM, a register our board doesn't have.  We made the function return a given value of 128MB, it's an ugly hack, but our board doesn't have a way of knowing the amount of RAM.</P
><P
>Wwe had the same problems with a bunch of functions called todc_XXXX, mainly
<TT
CLASS="function"
>todc_get_rtc_time()</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="function"
>todc_set_rtc_time()</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="function"
>time_init()</TT
> since we don't have a RTC (real-time clock) chip on our board, and those functions were using it. For the time being, we made the <TT
CLASS="function"
>todc_XXX</TT
> function only set and get a constant date and time, since our board doesn't have a bios battery and so cannot keep time when powered off.</P
><P
>Once all this was done, we found <TT
CLASS="function"
>todc_calibrate_descr()</TT
>, which again uses the RTC chip. We had to replace that function with our own:
