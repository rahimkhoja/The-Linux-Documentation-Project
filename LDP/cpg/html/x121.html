>2.1. Creating a development environment</H1
><P
>The minimum requirments are obviously a development station and a target. However,
the recommended way of working is having a third host which acts as a server. The server
runs several services such as ftp, telnet, NFS, tftp (if needed) and CVS. The main role of
the server is to run CVS and track version control, however once you can boot the target
from network, the server will also hold the target images, and filesystem,
which makes development much easier.</P
><P
>Regardless, the first step is to install a tool-chain (compiler, linker etc.) for your 
target. The HardHat Linux cdrom includes all the needed files, and the installation sequence
is documented in the HardHat Linux documentation. During the installation, you must select 
your LSP (basic software for the selected board), and HardHat will install a set of tools 
and a kernel source tree matching your LSP.</P
><P
>We had a board that had vxWorks running on it, so we setup the target to boot 
using the standard vxWorks loader. Once the loader initiated, we used visionICE to take-over 
the target (so that vxWorks won't load an image file) and load a Linux image into the target. 
What you need to do at this point is get an ICE, connect it to the network and to the target -
through a JTAG connection - and install the ICE software on your host.</P
