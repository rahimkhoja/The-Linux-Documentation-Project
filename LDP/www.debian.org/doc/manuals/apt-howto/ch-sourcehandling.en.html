<br>Chapter 6 - Working with source packages

<h2><a name="s-source"></a>6.1 Downloading source packages</h2>

<p>
It's common in the world of free software to study source code or even make
corrections to buggy code.  To do this, you would need to download the source
of the program.  The APT system provides an easy way to obtain source code to
the many programs contained in the distribution, including all the files needed
to create a .deb for the program.
</p>

<p>
Another common use of Debian sources is to adapt a more recent version of a
program, from the unstable distribution, for example, for use with the stable
distribution.  Compiling a package against stable will generate .debs with
dependencies adjusted to match the packages available in this distribution.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, the <samp>deb-src</samp> entry in your
<samp>/etc/apt/sources.list</samp> should be pointed at unstable.  It should
also be enabled (uncommented).  See section <a
href="ch-basico.en.html#s-sources.list">The /etc/apt/sources.list file, Section
2.1</a>.
</p>

<p>
To download a source package, you would use the following command:
</p>

<pre>
     $ apt-get source packagename
</pre>

<p>
This will download three files: a <samp>.orig.tar.gz</samp>, a
<samp>.dsc</samp> and a <samp>.diff.gz</samp>.  In the case of packages made
specifically for Debian, the last of these is not downloaded and the first
usually won't have <samp>&quot;orig&quot;</samp> in the name.
</p>

<p>
The <samp>.dsc</samp> file is used by dpkg-source for unpacking the source
package into the directory <var>packagename-version</var>.  Within each
downloaded source package there is a <samp>debian/</samp> directory that
contains the files needed for creating the .deb package.
</p>

<p>
To auto-build the package when it's been downloaded, just add <samp>-b</samp>
to the command line, like this:
</p>

<pre>
     $ apt-get -b source packagename
</pre>

<p>
If you decide not to create the .deb at the time of the download, you can
create it later by running:
</p>

<pre>
     $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b
</pre>

<p>
from within the directory that was created for the package after downloading.
To install the package built by the commands above one must use the package
manager directly, like this:
</p>

<pre>
     # dpkg -i <var>file.deb</var>
</pre>

<p>
There's a difference between <code>apt-get</code>'s <samp>source</samp> method
and its other methods.  The <samp>source</samp> method can be used by normal
users, without needing special root powers.  The files are downloaded to the
directory from which the <samp>apt-get source package</samp> command was
called.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s-build-dep"></a>6.2 Packages needed for compiling a source package</h2>

<p>
Normally, specific headers and shared libraries need to be present in order for
a source package to be compiled.  All source packages have a field in their
control files called 'Build-Depends:' that indicates which additional packages
are needed for the package to be built from source.
</p>

<p>
APT has a simple way of downloading these packages.  Just run <samp>apt-get
build-dep package</samp>, where `package' is the name of the package you're
going to build.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
     # apt-get build-dep gmc
     Reading Package Lists... Done
     Building Dependency Tree... Done
     The following NEW packages will be installed:
       comerr-dev e2fslibs-dev gdk-imlib-dev imlib-progs libgnome-dev libgnorba-dev
       libgpmg1-dev 
     0 packages upgraded, 7 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1  not upgraded.
     Need to get 1069kB of archives. After unpacking 3514kB will be used.
     Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
</pre>

<p>
The packages that will be installed are the packages needed in order for
<code>gmc</code> to be built correctly.  It's important to note that this
command doesn't look for the source package of the program to be compiled.  You
will therefore need to run <samp>apt-get source</samp> separately to get it.
</p>

<p>
If all you want is checking what packages are needed to build a given package,
there's a variant of the <samp>apt-cache show</samp> command (see <a
href="ch-search.en.html">Getting information about packages., Chapter 5</a>,
which will show, among other informations, the <samp>Build-Depends</samp> line
that lists those information, the <samp>Build-Depends</samp> line that lists
those
</p>

<pre>
     # apt-cache showsrc <var>package</var>
</pre>
