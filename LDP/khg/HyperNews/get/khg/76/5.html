Linux Transparent proxy support (part of the firewalling stuff) is designed to do exactly this.<P>

There are basically two "halves" to transparent proxy:<OL>

<LI>You can <TT>bind</TT> to any address you like, instead of choosing from the addresses of interfaces on the machine.

<LI>You can collect SYN packets (generated by clients doing <TT>connect</TT>) on a port of your choice.  You can do a <TT>getsockname</TT> to find out what address+port number the client <EM>thinks</EM> it connected to, and there are more fields in the "from" parameter of <TT>recvfrom</TT> that you can use to find out where a datagram was destined.

</OL>

So if you want to connect to a server while pretending to have some other IP address, you simply do a <TT>bind</TT> system call on the socket before <TT>connect</TT>ing.  The address you bind to is the address you want to appear to be.  This is just like doing a <TT>bind</TT> with a specific IP address or port number when you want a specific network interface or when you want a port number below 1024 for <TT>rcmd</TT>-based services, except that now you specify an IP address other than your own.<P>

If you're doing UDP, then you might want to do this with the <TT>sendto</TT> and <TT>recvfrom</TT> system calls, in which case the source address is specified in the second 8 bytes of the socket address for the destination address in <TT>sendto</TT> and vice-versa for the source address in <TT>recvfrom</TT>.<P>

Put another way, when you do a <TT>sendto</TT>, you put the destination address in the "to" parameter as usual, but you also put the desired source address (which is not the "usual" one) in the "to" parameter + 8 bytes.  Note that you must OR in <TT>MSG_PROXY</TT> to the flags parameter for <TT>sendto</TT>/<TT>recvfrom</TT>.<P>

Note that in order to use any of the transparent proxy features you must be <TT>root</TT>.  Generally this is most useful when the host doing transparent proxy is a gateway or router of some kind, because impersonating host A when connecting to host B will only work if host B will normally try to send packets to host A through your host.
