<p>I can't write and maintain the KHG by myself.  In order
to make this a success, I need help from readers:
<ul>
<li>If you see something wrong, <b>respond</b> with a correction.
<li>If you see something missing, either respond to say that
it is missing, or respond with the missing piece.
<li>If something is unclear, try to find out what it is
saying and post a clarification.  Otherwise, post a request
for clarification.
<li>If you can answer a request for clarification, do so.
<li>In order to encourage me to continue providing this
service, <b>subscribe</b> to the pages in which you are
most interested.
</ul>

<p>Responses <b>do not</b> have to be perfect, or in
perfect english.  Think of this like a mailing list,
not a book.  When I incorporate responses into the
the main text (body) of an article, I'll edit it.
I'm good at editing, and I enjoy doing it, especially
when I don't have a deadline.

<p>If the KHG remains a simply personal effort, it will
become less and less relevant.  With your help, it can
become more and more worth reading.

<p>Thanks!
