<p>I also have a slow dialup link; I use a 14.4 modem
and I'm currently about 20 network hops away from the
home site.  So I understand how annoying it can be.

<p>Nevertheless, I'm not going to offer a tar file of
the KHG at this time.  The primary reason for going to
a web-based presentation was to make it interactive,
and pushing it off-line would make it less interactive.

<p>For now, you can use web mirroring packages to create
your own local mirror and read from there.
Several such packages are available, and since I don't
use any of them, I don't have details like names: can
someone else who knows please post details?

<p>For the future, it would be nice if someone is
interested enough in mirroring to write scripts for
the KHG that allow you to read it off-line, but also
allow you to respond.
However, I will only give my imprimatur to a system which:
<ul>
<li>Mirrors everything, including responses.  The
responses are just as much a part of the new KHG as
the bodies of the articles.
<li>Provides a reasonable method of posting responses
from the off-line state; preferably it will queue them
up, and the process of "mirroring" the KHG will involve
two steps:
<ol>
<li>Post any queued responses back to the original site
<li>Mirror the whole thing again.
</ol>
They need to happen in that order, obviously.
</ul>

<p>If anyone is interested in working on such a system,
they are welcome to.  I won't be working on it; I have
too many other things on my plate and I wouldn't use it,
so I'd be a lousy choice for building it.  The person
who writes the system really ought to be someone who
will use it...

<p>I would include a pointer to those scripts from within
the KHG if anyone wrote them to my satisfaction.
