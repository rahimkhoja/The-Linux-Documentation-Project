getwww doesn't seem to understand different port numbers.
It would be fine if there were a configuration option that
said "do follow links that are on the same site but have
different port numbers" or "don't follow links that are on
the same site but have different port numbers", but getwww
doesn't understand either...

<p>When getting the KHG from port 8080, getwww sees absolute
links without a port number specified, and assumes that they
should come from port 8080 instead of port 80.

<p>There's another bug, but I don't know whether its a but
in getwww or in my.  Richard says that "it's a good idea
to put ~johnsonm/index.html among the URLs to avoid" but
I can't make it actually avoid that, and I've tried a lot
of command-line arguments by now.  Has anyone made that
work?  I managed to make it not suck down my home page
by explicitly telling the server on port 8080 not to
serve public_html pages, but that means that the link
to the device driver paper it still tries to download
and leaves as a broken link (because of the port number
bug).  It would make more sense for it to leave it as
a remote link, I'd think.
