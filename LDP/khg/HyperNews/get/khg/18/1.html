<P>Well, there are several types of sockets: TCP and UDP go over 
the wire formatted as TCP or UDP packets, unix-domain sockets
don't generally go over the wire (they're used for interprocess
communication). These are some of the built-in socket types
that the kernel understands (i.e. it will handle the 
connection management stuff at the front of each of these
packet types). Raw sockets are used to generate/receive packets
of a type that the kernel doesn't explicitly support.
</P>

<P>An easy example that you're probably familiar with is PING.
Ping works by sending out an ICMP (internet control message
protocol - another IP protocol distinct from TCP or UDP) echo
packet. The kernel has built-in code to respond to echo/ping
packets; it has to in order to comply with the TCP/IP spec.
It doesn't have code to generate these packets, because it
isn't required. So, rather than create another system call
with associated code in the kernel to accomplish this, the
"ping packet generator" is a program in user space. It 
formats an ICMP echo packet and sends it out over a SOCK_RAW,
waiting for a response. That's why ping runs as set-uid root.
