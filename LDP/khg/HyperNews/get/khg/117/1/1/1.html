I'm sorry, I didn't notice that he was
talking about software interrupts in the BIOS.
Not paying close enough attention...

<p>In order to call anything in the BIOS, you need to put the
processor in VM86 mode.  From user mode, it is possible to
do that in vm86 mode if you map the BIOS into the process's
memory.  dosemu does this in order to use the video bios.
However, you won't be able to just call int 0x10.  Linux
reprograms the interrupt controller on boot.  You can put
code in to see what slot 0x10 points at and save that
pointer and call it directly.

<p>From kernel mode, you can look at how the APM bios calls
are made in the file /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/apm_bios.c
and copy how it is done there.  Even in kernel mode, you need
to get a pointer rather than blindly call int 0x10.  And for
16-bit bioses, you need segment/offset, then use them to do
an lcall.  See arch/i386/boot/setup.S and
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c for how these kinds of parameters
get passed into the kernel on startup.  The are recorded
before the kernel goes into protected mode at all.

<p>Note that this is completely dependent on not booting
with a protected-mode boot utility that starts up the
kernel already in 32-bit mode.  Several such utilities
exist, but they aren't much used at this point by Linux
folks.

<p><b>However,</b> calling the BIOS is <b>slow</b>.  It's
fine for the apm stuff that doesn't need to be
high-performance, but I wouldn't touch it for a video
driver.  Every call involves saving the processor state,
changing processor mode, calling the bios, changing
processor mode, and restoring the processor state.  Assuming
that you are calling into the kernel to do this, that's
really an extra set of context switches.  If you are doing
it in a user-level library, you have device contention to
deal with, as well as security issues, since you certainly
need to be root to do this.

<p>If I were in your shoes, I would try to use this interface
only to set up a framebuffer, and then have the X server
write to memory which is mmap()ed to that framebuffer.
That will probably be faster than thunking through a
16-bit bios call level for every screen operation...
There's a generic Linux framebuffer interface that is
used on Linux/m68k, Linux/PPC, Linux/SPARC, and I think
other platforms as well.  You can start looking at that
by reading /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/fbmem.c; I don't
know the interface in any detail and can't help you beyond
that.

<p>If the bios is a 32-bit bios, you can skip saving state;
that won't be such a problem.  But since it wants a real
mode address for a block in memory, I doubt that's the
case.

<p>Good luck, but I won't be able to be much more help than
this.
