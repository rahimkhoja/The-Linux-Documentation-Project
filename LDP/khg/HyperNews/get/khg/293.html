<PRE>Hi Every one
 I currently have kernel v2.0.27  running in my computer and would like to
 patch the rtlinux and do some experience on it.
 So what I have done so far is I downloaded the patches from this page,
 unzipped it and stored it in a disk.
 While listing the files in windows I got these directory names: rtinux-0.5
 and underneath this directory was kernel_patch and etc...</PRE>
<P>


<PRE> For mounting the files I used the following command in Linux:
 mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt
 But after the mounting in /mnt I had different garbled file names such as
 rtlinu~1 &amp; kernel~1. As Michael said I should use exts filesystems which
 now I am using the msdos ones.
 But the problem is how? Is there anyway I can convert the files from msdos
 to ext2 in Linux? Which command should I use? 
 "Please, I am stuck here :)"</PRE>
<P>


<PRE> Another problem was, I tried to patch those files to the kernel and it
 started asking me the question : File patch to,
  which files should i mention, or is it another problem because of the
 original problem?</PRE>
<P>


<PRE> Have a great day</PRE>
<P>


<PRE> Thanks in advance,</PRE>
