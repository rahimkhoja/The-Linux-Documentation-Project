<h3>Tour of the Linux kernel source</h3>

<p>By Alessandro Rubini, rubini@pop.systemy.it

<p>This chapter tries to explain the Linux source code in an
orderly manner, trying to help the reader to achieve a good
understanding of how the source code is laid out and how the
most relevant unix features are implemented. The target is to
help the experienced C programmer who is not accustomed to
Linux in getting familiar with the overall Linux design. That's
why the chosen entry point for the kernel tour is the kernel
own entry point: system boot.

<p>A good understanding of C language is required to understand
this material, as well as some familiarity with both Unix
concepts and the PC architecture. However, no C code will
appear in this chapter, but rather pointers to the actual code.
The finest issues of kernel design are explained in other
chapters of this guide, while this chapter tends to remain an
informal overview.

<p>Any pathname for files referenced in this chapter is
referred to the main source-tree directory, usually
/usr/src/linux.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">Most of the information
reported here is taken from the source code of Linux release
1.0. Nonetheless, references to later versions are provided at
times. Any paragraph within the tour with the <IMG
src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]"> image in front of it is meant to
underline changes the kernel has undergone after the 1.0
release. If no such paragraph is present, then no changes
occurred up to release 1.0.9-1.1.76.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">Sometimes a paragraph like
this occurs in the text. It is a pointer to the right sources
to get more information on the subject just covered. Needless
to say, <i>the source</i> is the primary source.

<h4>Booting the system</h4>

<p>When the PC is powered up, the 80x86 processor finds itself
in real mode and executes the code at address 0xFFFF0, which
corresponds to a ROM-BIOS address. The PC BIOS performs some
tests on the system and initializes the interrupt vector at
physical address 0. After that it loads the first sector of a
bootable device to 0x7C00, and jumps to it. The device is
usually the floppy or the hard drive. The preceding description
is quite a simplified one, but it's all that's needed to
understand the kernel initial workings.

<p>The very first part of the Linux kernel is written in 8086
assembly language (boot/bootsect.S). When run, it moves itself
to absolute address 0x90000, loads the next 2 kBytes of code
from the boot device to address 0x90200, and the rest of the
kernel to address 0x10000. The message ``<tt>Loading...</tt>''
is displayed during system load. Control is then passed to the
code in boot/Setup.S, another real-mode assembly source.

<p>The setup portion identifies some features of the host
system and the type of vga board. If requested to, it asks the
user to choose the video mode for the console. It then moves
the whole system from address 0x10000 to address 0x1000, enters
protected mode and jumps to the rest of the system (at 0x1000).

<p>The next step is kernel decompression. The code at 0x1000
comes from zBoot/head.S which initializes registers and invokes
<tt>decompress_kernel()</tt>, which in turn is made up of
zBoot/inflate.c, zBoot/unzip.c and zBoot/misc.c. The
decompressed data goes to address 0x100000 (1 Meg), and this is
the main reason why Linux can't run with less than 2 megs ram.
[It's been done in 1 MB with uncompressed kernels; see
<A href="http://rsphy1.anu.edu.au/~gpg109/mem.html">Memory Savers</a>--ED]

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">Encapsulation of the kernel
in a gzip file is accomplished by Makefile and utilities in the
zBoot directory. They are interesting files to look at.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">Kernel release 1.1.75 moved
the boot and zBoot directories down to arch/i386/boot. This
change is meant to allow true kernel builds for different
architectures. Nonetheless, I'll stick to i386-specific
information.

<p>Decompressed code is executed at address 0x1010000 <b>[Maybe
I've lost track of physical addresses, here, as I don't know
very well gas source code]</b>, where all the 32-bit setup is
accomplished: IDT, GDT and LDT are loaded, the processor and
coprocessor are identified, and paging is setup; eventually,
the routine <tt>start_kernel</tt> is invoked. The source for
the above operations is in boot/head.S. It is probably the
trickiest code in the whole kernel.

<p>Note that if an error occurs during any of the preceding
steps, the computer will lockup. The OS can't deal with errors
when it isn't yet fully operative.

<p><tt>start_kernel()</tt> resides in init/main.c, and never
returns. Anything from now on is coded in C language, left
aside interrupt management and system call enter/leave (well,
most of the macros embed assembly code, too).

<h4>Spinning the wheel</h4>

<p>After dealing with all the tricky questions,
<tt>start_kernel()</tt> initializes all the parts of the
kernel, specifically:
<ul>
<li>Sets the memory bounds and calls <tt>paging_init()</tt>.
<li>Initializes the traps, IRQ channels and scheduling.
<li>Parses the command line.
<li>If requested to, allocates a profiling buffer.
<li>Initializes all the device drivers and disk buffering,
as well as other minor parts.
<li>Calibrates the delay loop (computes the ``BogoMips'' number).
<li>Checks if interrupt 16 works with the coprocessor.
</ul>

<p>Finally, the kernel is ready to
<tt>move_to_user_mode()</tt>, in order to fork the
<tt>init</tt> process, whose code is in the same source file.
Process number 0 then, the so-called idle task, keeps running
in an infinite idle loop.

<p>The <tt>init</tt> process tries to execute /etc/init, or
/bin/init, or /sbin/init.

<p>If none of them succeeds, code is provided to execute
``/bin/sh /etc/rc'' and fork a root shell on the first
terminal.  This code dates back to Linux 0.01, when the OS was
made by the kernel alone, and no <tt>login</tt> process was
available.

<p>After <tt>exec()</tt>ing the init program from one of the
standard places (let's assume we have one of them), the kernel
has no direct control on the program flow. Its role, from now
on is to provide processes with system calls, as well as
servicing asynchronous events (such as hardware interrupts).
Multitasking has been setup, and it is now init which manages
multiuser access by <tt>fork()</tt>ing system daemons and login
processes.

<p>Being the kernel in charge of providing services, the tour
will proceed by looking at those services (the ``system
calls''), as well as by providing general ideas about the
underlying data structures and code organization.

<h4>How the kernel sees a process</h4>

<p>From the kernel point of view, a process is an entry in the
process table. Nothing more.

<p>The process table, then, is one of the most important data
structures within the system, together with the
memory-management tables and the buffer cache. The individual
item in the process table is the <tt>task_struct</tt>
structure, quite a huge one, defined in include/linux/sched.h.
Within the <tt>task_struct</tt> both low-level and high-level
information is kept--ranging from the copy of some hardware
registers to the inode of the working directory for the
process.

<p>The process table is both an array and a double-linked list,
as well as a tree. The physical implementation is a static
array of pointers, whose length is <tt>NR_TASKS</tt>, a
constant defined in include/linux/tasks.h, and each structure
resides in a reserved memory page. The list structure is
achieved through the pointers <tt>next_task</tt> and
<tt>prev_task</tt>, while the tree structure is quite complex
and will not be described here. You may wish to change
<tt>NR_TASKS</tt> from the default vaue of 128, but be sure to
have proper dependency files to force recompilation of all the
source files involved.

<p>After booting is over, the kernel is always working on
behalf of one of the processes, and the global variable
<tt>current</tt>, a pointer to a <tt>task_struct</tt> item, is
used to record the running one. <tt>current</tt> is only
changed by the scheduler, in kernel/sched.c. When, however, all
procecces must be looked at, the macro <tt>for_each_task</tt>
is used. It is conderably faster than a sequential scan of the
array, when the system is lightly loaded.

<p>A process is always running in either ``user mode'' or
``kernel mode''. The main body of a user program is executed in
user mode and system calls are executed in kernel mode. The
stack used by the process in the two execution modes is
different--a conventional stack segment is used for user mode,
while a fixed-size stack (one page, owned by the process) is
used in kernel mode.  The kernel stack page is never swapped
out, because it must be available whenever a system call is
entered.

<p>System calls, within the kernel, exist as C language
functions, their `official' name being prefixed by
`<tt>sys_</tt>'. A system call named, for example,
<tt><i>burnout</i></tt> invokes the kernel function
<tt>sys_<i>burnout</i>()</tt>.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">The system call mechanism is
described in chapter 3 of this guide. Looking at
<tt>for_each_task</tt> and <tt>SET_LINKS</tt>, in
include/linux/sched.h can help understanding the list and tree
structures in the process table.

<h4>Creating and destroying processes</h4>

<p>A unix system creates a process though the <tt>fork()</tt>
system call, and process termination is performed either by
<tt>exit()</tt> or by receiving a signal. The Linux
implementation for them resides in kernel/fork.c and
kernel/exit.c.

<p>Forking is easy, and fork.c is short and ready
understandable. Its main task is filling the data structure for
the new process. Relevant steps, apart from filling fields, are:
<ul>
<li>getting a free page to hold the <tt>task_struct</tt>
<li>finding an empty process slot (<tt>find_empty_process()</tt>)
<li>getting another free page for the <tt>kernel_stack_page</tt>
<li>copying the father's LDT to the child
<li>duplicating <tt>mmap</tt> information of the father
</ul>
<tt>sys_fork()</tt> also manages file descriptors and inodes.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">The 1.0 kernel offers some
vestigial support to threading, and the <tt>fork()</tt> system
call shows some hints to that. Kernel threads is
work-in-progress outside the mainstream kernel.

<p>Exiting from a process is trickier, because the parent
process must be notified about any child who exits. Moreover, a
process can exit by being <tt>kill()</tt>ed by another process
(these are Unix features). The file exit.c is therefore the
home of <tt>sys_kill()</tt> and the vairious flavours of
<tt>sys_wait()</tt>, in addition to <tt>sys_exit()</tt>.

<p>The code belonging to exit.c is not described here--it is
not that interesting. It deals with a lot of details in order
to leave the system in a consistent state. The POSIX standard,
then, is quite demanding about signals, and it must be dealt
with.

<h4>Executing programs</h4>

<p>After <tt>fork()</tt>ing, two copies of the same program are
running. One of them usually <tt>exec()</tt>s another program.
The <tt>exec()</tt> system call must locate the binary image of
the executable file, load and run it. The word `load' doesn't
necessarily mean ``copy in memory the binary image'', as Linux
supports demand loading.

<p>The Linux implementation of <tt>exec()</tt> supports
different binary formats. This is accomplished through the
<tt>linux_binfmt</tt> structure, which embeds two pointers to
functions--one to load the executable and the other to load the
library, each binary format representing both the executable
and the library. Loading of shared libraries is implemented in
the same source file as <tt>exec()</tt> is, but let's stick to
<tt>exec()</tt> itself.

<p>The Unix systems provide the programmer with six flavours of
the <tt>exec()</tt> function. All but one of them can be
implemented as library functions, and theLinux kernel
implements <tt>sys_execve()</tt> alone. It performs quite a
simple task: loading the head of the executable, and trying to
execute it. If the first two bytes are ``<tt>#!</tt>'', then
the first line is parsed and an interpreter is invoked,
otherwise the registered binary formats are sequentially tried.

<p>The native Linux format is supported directly within
fs/exec.c, and the relevant functions are
<tt>load_aout_binary</tt> and <tt>load_aout_library</tt>.  As
for the binaries, the function loading an ``a.out'' executable
ends up either in <tt>mmap()</tt>ing the disk file, or in
calling <tt>read_exec()</tt>.  The former way uses the Linux
demand loading mechanism to fault-in program pages when they're
accessed, while the latter way is used when memory mapping is
not supported by the host filesystem (for example the ``msdos''
filesystem).

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">Late 1.1 kernels embed a
revised msdos filesystem, which supports <tt>mmap()</tt>.
Moreover, the <tt>struct linux_binfmt</tt> is a linked list
rather than an array, to allow loading a new binary format as a
kernel module. Finally, the structure itself has been extended
to access format-related core-dump routines.

<h4>Accessing filesystems</h4>

<p>It is well known that the filesystem is the most basic
resource in a Unix system, so basic and ubiquitous that it
needs a more handy name--I'll stick to the standard practice of
calling it simply ``fs''.

<p>I'll assume the reader already knows the basic Unix fs
ideas--access permissions, inodes, the superblock,
<b>mount</b>ing and <b>umount</b>ing. Those concepts are well
explained by smarter authors than me within the standard Unix
literature, so I won't duplicate their efforts and I'll stick
to Linux specific issues.

<!--
% Fs code takes from 20 to 25\% of the kernel source tree.
% Actually, a Unix OS can't live without a filesystem,
% because any hardware access occurrs through a device driver, which in turn
% is identified by a filename within the filesystem. 
-->

<p>While the first Unices used to support a single fs type,
whose structure was widespread in the whole kernel, today's
practice is to use a standardized interface between the kernel
and the fs, in order to ease data interchange across
architectures. Linux itself provides a standardized layer to
pass information between the kernel and each fs module. This
interface layer is called VFS, for ``virtual filesystem''.

<p>Filesystem code is therefore split into two layers: the
upper layer is concerned with the management of kernel tables
and data structures, while the lower layer is made up of the
set of fs-dependent functions, and is invoked through the VFS
data structures.

All the fs-independent material resides in the fs/*.c files.
They address the following issues:
<ul>
<li>Managing the buffer chache (buffer.c);
<li>Responding to the <tt>fcntl()</tt> and <tt>ioctl()</tt> system calls (fcntl.c and ioctl.c);
<li>Mapping pipes and fifos on inodes and buffers (fifo.c, pipe.c);
<li>Managing file- and inode-tables (file_table.c, inode.c);
<li>Locking and unlocking files and records (locks.c);
<li>Mapping names to inodes (namei.c, open.c);
<li>Implementing the tricky <tt>select()</tt> function (select.c);
<li>Providing information (stat.c);
<li>mounting and umounting filesystems (super.c);
<li><tt>exec()</tt>ing executables and dumping cores (exec.c);
<li>Loading the various binary formats (bin_fmt*.c, as outlined above).
</ul>

<p>The VFS interface, then, consists of a set of relatively
high-level operations which are invoked from the fs-independent
code and are actually performed by each filesystem type. The
most relevant structures are <tt>inode_operations</tt> and
<tt>file_operations</tt>, though they're not alone: other
structures exist as well. All of them are defined within
include/linux/fs.h.

<p>The kernel entry point to the actual file system is the
structure <tt>file_system_type</tt>. An array of
<tt>file_system_type</tt>s is embodied within fs/filesystems.c
and it is referenced whenever a mount is issued. The function
<tt>read_super</tt> for the relevant fs type is then in charge
of filling a <tt>struct super_block</tt> item, which in turn
embeds a <tt>struct super_operations</tt> and a <tt>struct
<i>type</i>_sb_info</tt>. The former provides pointers to generic
fs operations for the current fs-type, the latter embeds
specific information for the fs-type.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">The array of filesystem types
has been turned in a linked list, to allow loading new fs types
as kernel modules. The function
(<tt>un</tt>-)<tt>register_filesystem</tt> is coded within
fs/super.c.

<h4>Quick Anatomy of a Filesystem Type</h4>

<p>The role of a filesystem type is to perform the low-level
tasks used to map the relatively high level VFS operations on
the physical media (disks, network or whatever). The VFS
interface is flexible enough to allow support for both
conventional Unix filesystems and exotic situations such as the
msdos and umsdos types.

<p>Each fs-type is made up of the following items, in addition
to its own directory:
<ul>
<li>An entry in the <tt>file_systems[]</tt> array (fs/filesystems.c);
<li>The superblock include file (include/linux/<i>type</i>_fs_sb.h);
<li>The inode include file (include/linux/<i>type</i>_fs_i.h);
<li>The generic own include file (include/linux/<i>type</i>_fs.h});
<li>Two <tt>#include</tt> lines within include/linux/fs.h, as well
as the entries in <tt>struct super_block</tt> and <tt>struct inode</tt>.
</ul>

<p>The own directory for the fs type contains all the real
code, responsible of inode and data management.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">The chapter about procfs
in this guide uncovers all the details about low-level code and
VFS interface for that fs type. Source code in fs/procfs is
quite understandable after reading the chapter.

<p>We'll now look at the internal workings of the VFS
mechanism, and the minix filesystem source is used as a working
example. I chose the minix type because it is small but
complete; moreover, any other fs type in Linux derives from the
minix one. The ext2 type, the de-facto standard in recent Linux
installations, is much more complex than that and its
exploration is left as an exercise for the smart reader.

<p>When a minix-fs is mounted, <tt>minix_read_super</tt> fills
the <tt>super_block</tt> structure with data read from the
mounted device. The <tt>s_op</tt> field of the structure will
then hold a pointer to <tt>minix_sops</tt>, which is used by
the generic filesystem code to dispatch superblock operations.

<p>Chaining the newly mounted fs in the global system tree
relies on the following data items (assuming <tt>sb</tt> is the
<tt>super_block</tt> structure and <tt>dir_i</tt> points to the
inode for the mount point):
<ul>
<li><tt>sb->s_mounted</tt> points to the root-dir inode
of the mounted filesystem (<tt>MINIX_ROOT_INO</tt>);
<li><tt>dir_i->i_mount</tt> holds <tt>sb->s_mounted</tt>;
<li><tt>sb->s_covered</tt> holds <tt>dir_i</tt>
</ul>

<p>Umounting will eventually be performed by
<tt>do_umount</tt>, which in turn invokes
<tt>minix_put_super</tt>.

<p>Whenever a file is accessed, <tt>minix_read_inode</tt> comes
into play; it fills the system-wide <tt>inode</tt> structure
with fields coming form <tt>minix_inode</tt>. The
<tt>inode->i_op</tt> field is filled according to
<tt>inode->i_mode</tt> and it is responsible for any further
operation on the file. The source for the minix functions just
described are to be found in fs/minix/inode.c.

<p>The <tt>inode_operations</tt> structure is used to dispatch
inode operations (you guessed it) to the fs-type specific
kernel functions; the first entry in the structure is a pointer
to a <tt>file_operations</tt> item, which is the
data-management equivalent of <tt>i_op</tt>. The minix fs-type
allows three instances of inode-operation sets (for
direcotries, for files and for symbolic links) and two
instances of file-operation sets (symlinks don't need one).

<p>Directory operations (<tt>minix_readdir</tt> alone) are to
be found in fs/minix/dir.c; file operations (read and write)
appear within fs/minix/file.c and symlink operations (reading
and following the link) in fs/minix/symlink.c.

<p>The rest of the minix directory implements the following
tasks:
<ul>
<li>bitmap.c manages allocation and freeing of inodes and blocks
(the ext2 fs, otherwise, has two different source files);
<li>fsynk.c is responsible for the <tt>fsync()</tt> system calls--it
manages direct, indirect and double indirect blocks (I assume
you know about them, it's common Unix knowledge);
<li>namei.c embeds all the name-related inode operations,
such as creating and destroying nodes, renaming and linking;
<li>truncate.c performs truncation of files.
</ul>

<h4>The console driver</h4>

<p>Being the main I/O device on most Linux boxes, the console
driver deserves some attention. The source code related to the
console, as well as the other character drivers, is to be found
in drivers/char, and we'll use this very directory as our
referenece point when naming files.

<p>Console initialization is performed by the function
<tt>tty_init()</tt>, in tty_io.c. This function is only
concerned in getting major device numbers and calling the init
function for each device set. <tt>con_init()</tt>, then is the
one related to the console, and resides in console.c.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">Initialization of the console
has changed quite a lot during 1.1 evolution.
<tt>console_init()</tt> has been detatched from
<tt>tty_init()</tt>, and is called directly by ../../main.c.
The virtual consoles are now dynamically allocated, and quite a
good deal of code has changed. So, I'll skip the details of
initialization, allocation and such.

<h5>How file operations are dispatched to the console</h5>

<p>This paragraph is quite low-level, and can be happily
skipped over.

<p>Needless to say, a Unix device is accessed though the
filesystem. This paragraph details all steps from the device
file to the actual console functions. Moreover, the following
information is extracted from the 1.1.73 source code, and it
may be slightly different from the 1.0 source.

<p>When a device inode is opened, the function
<tt>chrdev_open()</tt> (or <tt>blkdev_open()</tt>, but we'll
stich to character devices) in ../../fs/devices.c gets
executed. This function is reached by means of the structure
<tt>def_chr_fops</tt>, which in turn is referenced by
<tt>chrdev_inode_operations</tt>, used by all the filesystem
types (see the previous section about filesystems).

<p><tt>chrdev_open</tt> takes care of specifying the device
operations by substituting the device specific
<tt>file_operations</tt> table in the current <tt>filp</tt> and
calls the specific <tt>open()</tt>. Device specific tables are
kept in the array <tt>chrdevs[]</tt>, indexed by the majour
device number, and filled by the same ../../fs/devices.c.

<p>If the device is a tty one (aren't we aiming at the
console?), we come to the tty drivers, whose functions are in
<tt>tty_io.c</tt>, indexed by <tt>tty_fops</tt>. Thus,
<tt>tty_open()</tt> calls <tt>init_dev()</tt>, which allocates
any data structure needed by the device, based on the minor
device number.

<p>The minor number is also used to retrieve the actual driver
for the device, which has been registered through
<tt>tty_register_driver()</tt>. The driver, then, is still
another structure used to dispatch computation, just like
<tt>file_ops</tt>; it is concerned with writing and controlling
the device.  The last data structure used in managing a tty is
the line discipline, described later. The line discipline for
the console (and any other tty device) is set by
<tt>initialize_tty_struct()</tt>, invoked by <tt>init_dev</tt>.

<p>Everything we touched in this paragraph is
device-independent. The only console-specific particular is
that console.c, has registered its own driver during
<tt>con_init()</tt>. The line discipline, on the contrary, in
independent of the device.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">The <tt>tty_driver</tt>
structure is fully explained within
<tt>&lt;linux/tty_driver.h&gt;</tt>.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">The above information has
been extracted from 1.1.73 source code. It isn't unlikely for
your kernel to be somewhat different (``This information is
subject to change without notice'').

<h5>Writing to the console</h5>

<p>When a console device is written to, the function
<tt>con_write</tt> gets invoked. This function manages all the
control characters and escape sequences used to provide
applications with complete screen management. The escape
sequences implemented are those of the vt102 terminal; This
means that your environment should say <tt>TERM=vt102</tt> when
you are telnetting to a non-Linux host; the best choice for
local activities, however, is <tt>TERM=console</tt> because the
Linux console offers a superset of vt102 functionality.

<p><tt>con_write()</tt>, thus, is mostly made up of nested
switch statements, used to handle a finite state automaton
interpreting escape sequences one character at a time. When in
normal mode, the character being printed is written directly to
the video memory, using the current <tt>attr</tt>-ibute. Within
console.c, all the fields of <tt>struct vc</tt> are made
accessible through macros, so any reference to (for example)
<tt>attr</tt>, does actually refer to the field in the
structure <tt>vc_cons[currcons]</tt>, as long as
<tt>currcons</tt> is the number of the console being referred
to.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">Actually, <tt>vc_cons</tt> in
newer kernels is no longer an array of structures , it now is
an array of pointers whose contents are <tt>kmalloc()</tt>ed.
The use of macros greatly simplified changing the approach,
because much of the code didn't need to be rewritten.

<p>Actual mapping and unmapping of the console memory to screen
is performed by the functions <tt>set_scrmem()</tt> (which
copies data from the console buffer to video memory) and
<tt>get_scrmem</tt> (which copies back data to the console
buffer). The private buffer of the current console is
physically mapped on the actual video RAM, in order to minimize
the number of data transfers. This means that <tt>get</tt>- and
<tt>set</tt>-<tt>_scrmem()</tt> are <tt>static</tt> to console.c and
are called only during a console switch.

<h5>Reading the console</h5>

<p>Reading the console is accomplished through the
line-discipline.  The default (and unique) line discipline in
Linux is called <tt>tty_ldisc_N_TTY</tt>. The line discipline
is what ``disciplines input through a line''. It is another
function table (we're used to the approach, aren't we?), which
is concerned with reading the device. With the help of
<tt>termios</tt> flags, the line discipline is what controls
input from the tty: raw, cbreak and cooked mode;
<tt>select()</tt>; <tt>ioctl()</tt> and so on.

<p>The read function in the line discipline is called
<tt>read_chan()</tt>, which reads the tty buffer independently
of whence it came from. The reason is that character arrival
through a tty is managed by asynchronous hardware interrupts.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">The line discipline
<tt>N_TTY</tt> is to be found in the same tty_io.c, though
later kernels use a different n_tty.c source file.

<p>The lowest level of console input is part of keyboard
management, and thus it is handled within keyboard.c, in the
function <tt>keyboard_interrupt()</tt>.

<h5>Keyboard management</h5>

<p>Keyboard management is quite a nightmare. It is confined to
the file keyboard.c, which is full of hexadecimal numbers to
represent the various keycodes appearing in keyboards of
different manifacturers.

<p>I won't dig in keyboard.c, because no relevant information
is there to the kernel hacker.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/more.gif" alt="[MORE]">For those readers who are
really interested in the Linux keyboard, the best approach to
keyboard.c is from the last line upward. Lowest level details
occur mainly in the first half of the file.

<h5>Switching the current console</h5>

<p>The current console is switched through invocation of the
function <tt>change_console()</tt>, which resides in tty_io.c
and is invoked by both keyboard.c and vt.c (the former switches
console in response to keypresses, the latter when a program
requests it by invoking an <tt>ioctl()</tt> call).

<p>The actual switching process is performed in two steps, and
the function <tt>complete_change_console()</tt> takes care of
the second part of it. Splitting the switch is meant to
complete the task after a possible handshake with the process
controlling the tty we're leaving. If the console is not under
process control, <tt>change_console()</tt> calls
<tt>complete_change_console()</tt> by itself. Process
intervertion is needed to successfully switch from a graphic
console to a text one and viceversa, and the X server (for
example) is the controlling process of its own graphic console.

<h5>The selection mechanism</h5>

<p>``<tt>selection</tt>'' is the cut and paste facility for the
Linux text consoles. The mechanism is mainly handled by a
user-level process, which can be instantiated by either
selection or gpm. The user-level program uses <tt>ioctl()</tt>
on the console to tell the kernel to highlight a region of the
screen. The selected text, then, is copied to a selection
buffer. The buffer is a static entity in console.c. Pasting
text is accomplished by `manually' pushing characters in the
tty input queue. The whole selection mechanism is protected by
<tt>#ifdef</tt> so users can disable it during kernel
configuration to save a few kilobytes of ram.

<p>Selection is a very-low-level facility, and its workings are
hidden from any other kernel activity. This means that most
<tt>#ifdef</tt>'s simply deals with removing the highlight
before the screen is modified in any way.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">Newer kernels feature
improved code for selection, and the mouse pointer can be
highlighted independently of the selected text (1.1.32 and
later).  Moreover, from 1.1.73 onward a dynamic buffer is used
for selected text rather than a static one, making the kernel
4kB smaller.

<h5><tt>ioctl()</tt>ling the device</h5>

<p>The <tt>ioctl()</tt> system call is the entry point for user
processes to control the behaviour of device files. Ioctl
management is spawned by ../../fs/ioctl.c, where the real
<tt>sys_ioctl()</tt> resides. The standard <tt>ioctl</tt>
requests are performed right there, other file-related requests
are processed by <tt>file_ioctl()</tt> (same source file),
while any other request is dispatches to the device-specific
<tt>ioctl()</tt> function.

<p>The <tt>ioctl</tt> material for console devices resides in
vt.c, because the console driver dispatches ioctl requests to
<tt>vt_ioctl()</tt>.

<p><IMG src="../../../KHGicons/new.gif" alt="[NEW]">The information above refer
to 1.1.7x. The 1.0 kernel doesn't have the ``driver'' table,
and <tt>vt_ioctl()</tt> is pointed to directly by the
<tt>file_operations()</tt> table.

<p>Ioctl material is quite confused, indeed. Some requests are
related to the device, and some are related to the line
discipline. I'll try to summarize things for the 1.0 and the
1.1.7x kernels. Anything happened in between.

<p>The 1.1.7x series features the following approach:
tty_ioctl.c implements only line discipline requests (namely
<tt>n_tty_ioctl()</tt>, which is the only n_tty function
outside of n_tty.c), while the <tt>file_operations</tt> field
points to <tt>tty_ioctl()</tt> in tty_io.c. If the request
number is not resolved by <tt>tty_ioctl()</tt>, it is passed
along to <tt>tty->driver.ioctl</tt> or, if it fails, to
<tt>tty->ldisc.ioctl</tt>. Driver-related stuff for the console
it to be found in vt.c, while line discipline material is in
tty_ioctl.c.

<p>In the 1.0 kernel, <tt>tty_ioctl()</tt> is in tty_ioctl.c
and is pointed to by generic tty <tt>file_operations</tt>.
Unresolved requests are passed along to the specific ioctl
function or to the line-discipline code, in a way similar to
1.1.7x.

<p>Note that in both cases, the <tt>TIOCLINUX</tt> request is
in the device-independent code. This implies that the console
selection can be set by <tt>ioctl</tt>ling any tty
(<tt>set_selection()</tt> always operates on the foreground
console), and this is a security hole. It is also a good reason
to switch to a newer kernel, where the problem is fixed by only
allowing the superuser to handle the selection.

<!--
% Well, I'm telling Linus about the problem right now...
-->

<p>A variety of requests can be issued to the console device,
and the best way to know about them is to browse the source
file vt.c.
