<P>I am working on interfacing directly with the networking
device drivers on my linux box.  I have tracked down the 
functions for transmitting ( dev_queue_xmit() ) packets down to the driver level.
What I need to do is bypass the socket interface without
destroying it ... So that I can transmit my own packets or
my own design down to the wire ( I am using this for my job of
testing new networking hardware -- RMON probes mostly ) so I
need to be able to create both good and bad packets with most
any kind of data contained inside as RMON-2 will be able to 
pick apart a packet and identify its contents.
</P>

<P>We can build the packets, but we can't get them to the wire
through standard means.  I think that this can be accomplished
with the dev_queue_xmit() function.   Question is:  in the 
sk_buff structure what do I need to set up specifically so that
dev_queue_xmit() and the driver will simply pass my data to the
hardware without building the standard headers required by ethernet
and other network types?  I'll worry about that, and if I make
a mistake I will clean up the mess.  Any help is appreciated.
</P>

<P>TIA
