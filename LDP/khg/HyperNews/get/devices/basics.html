<h3>Device Driver Basics</h3>

<p>We will assume that you decide that you do not wish to write
a user-space device, and would rather implement your device in
the kernel.  You will probably be writing writing two files, a
<tt>.c</tt> file and a <tt>.h</tt> file, and possibly modifying
other files as well, as will be described below.  We will refer
to your files as foo.c and foo.h, and your driver will be the
<tt>foo</tt> driver.

<h4>Namespace</h4>

<p>One of the first things you will need to do, before writing
any code, is to name your device.  This name should be a short
(probably two or three character) string.  For instance, the
parallel device is the ``<tt>lp</tt>'' device, the floppies are
the ``<tt>fd</tt>'' devices, and SCSI disks are the
``<tt>sd</tt>'' devices.  As you write your driver, you will
give your functions names prefixed with your chosen string to
avoid any namespace confusion.  We will call your prefix
<tt>foo,</tt> and give your functions names like
<tt>foo_read(), foo_write(),</tt> etc.

<h4>Allocating memory</h4>

<p>Memory allocation in the kernel is a little different from
memory allocation in normal user-level programs.  Instead of
having a <tt>malloc()</tt> capable of delivering almost
unlimited amounts of memory, there is a <tt>kmalloc()</tt>
function that is a bit different:
<ul>
<li>Memory is provided in pieces whose size is a power of 2, except
that pieces larger than 128 bytes are allocated in blocks whose size
is a power of 2 minus some small amount for overhead.
You can request any odd size, but memory will not be used any more
efficiently if you request a 31-byte piece than it will if you request
a 32 byte piece.  Also, there is a limit to the amount of memory that
can be allocated, which is currently 131056 bytes.
<li><tt>kmalloc()</tt> takes a second argument, the priority.  This is
used as an argument to the <tt>get_free_page()</tt> function, where it
is used to determine when to return.  The usual priority is
<tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt>.  If it may be called from within an interrupt, use
<tt>GFP_ATOMIC</tt> and be truly prepared for it to fail (don't panic).
This is because if you specify <tt>GFP_KERNEL</tt>, <tt>kmalloc()</tt> may
sleep, which cannot be done on an interrupt.  The other option is
<tt>GFP_BUFFER</tt>, which is used only when the kernel is allocating buffer
space, and never in device drivers.
</ul>

<p>To free memory allocated with <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, use one of
two functions: <tt>kfree()</tt> or <tt>kfree_s()</tt>.  These
differ from <tt>free()</tt> in a few ways as well:
<ul>
<li><tt>kfree()</tt> is a macro which calls <tt>kfree_s()</tt> and acts
like the standard <tt>free()</tt> outside the kernel.
<li>If you know what size object you are freeing, you can speed
things up by calling <tt>kfree_s()</tt> directly.  It takes two
arguments:  the first is the pointer that you are freeing, as in the
single argument to <tt>kfree()</tt>, and the second is the size of the
object being freed.
</ul>

<p>See <A HREF="reference.html">Supporting Functions</a> for
more information on <tt>kmalloc()</tt>, <tt>kfree()</tt>, and
other useful functions.

<p>Be gentle when you use kmalloc.  Use only what you have to.
Remember that kernel memory is unswappable, and thus allocating
extra memory in the kernel is a far worse thing to do in the
kernel than in a user-level program.  Take only what you need,
and free it when you are done, unless you are going to use it
right away again.

<h4>Character vs. block devices</h4>

<p>There are two main types of devices under all Unix systems,
character and block devices.  Character devices are those for
which no buffering is performed, and block devices are those
which are accessed through a cache.  Block devices must be
random access, but character devices are not required to be,
though some are.  Filesystems can only be mounted if they are
on block devices.

<p>Character devices are read from and written to with two
function: <tt>foo_read()</tt> and <tt>foo_write()</tt>.  The
<tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> calls do not return until
the operation is complete.  By contrast, block devices do not
even implement the <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt>
functions, and instead have a function which has historically
been called the ``strategy routine.'' Reads and writes are done
through the buffer cache mechanism by the generic functions
<tt>bread(),</tt> <tt>breada(),</tt> and <tt>bwrite()</tt>.
These functions go through the buffer cache, and so may or may
not actually call the strategy routine, depending on whether or
not the block requested is in the buffer cache (for reads) or
on whether or not the buffer cache is full (for writes).  A
request may be asyncronous: <tt>breada()</tt> can request the
strategy routine to schedule reads that have not been asked
for, and to do it asyncronously, in the background, in the
hopes that they will be needed later.

<p>The sources for character devices are kept in drivers/char/,
and the sources for block devices are kept in drivers/block/.
They have similar interfaces, and are very much alike, except
for reading and writing.  Because of the difference in reading
and writing, initialization is different, as block devices have
to register a strategy routine, which is registered in a
different way than the <tt>foo_read()</tt> and
<tt>foo_write()</tt> routines of a character device driver.
Specifics are dealt with in
<A HREF="char.html#init">Character Device Initialization</a> and
<A HREF="block.html#init">Block Device Initialization</a>.

<h4>Interrupts vs. Polling</h4>

<p>Hardware is slow.  That is, in the time it takes to get
information from your average device, the CPU could be off
doing something far more useful than waiting for a busy but
slow device.  So to keep from having to <b>busy-wait</b> all
the time, <b>interrupts</b> are provided which can interrupt
whatever is happening so that the operating system can do some
task and return to what it was doing without losing
information.  In an ideal world, all devices would probably
work by using interrupts.  However, on a PC or clone, there are
only a few interrupts available for use by your peripherals, so
some drivers have to poll the hardware: ask the hardware if it
is ready to transfer data yet.  This unfortunately wastes time,
but it sometimes needs to be done.

<p>Some hardware (like memory-mapped displays) is as fast
as the rest of the machine, and does not generate output
asyncronously, so an interrupt-driven driver would be rather
silly, even if interrupts were provided.

<p>In Linux, many of the drivers are interrupt-driven, but some
are not, and at least one can be either, and can be switched
back and forth at runtime.  For instance, the <tt>lp</tt>
device (the parallel port driver) normally polls the printer to
see if the printer is ready to accept output, and if the
printer stays in a not ready phase for too long, the driver
will sleep for a while, and try again later.  This improves
system performance.  However, if you have a parallel card that
supplies an interrupt, the driver will utilize that, which will
usually make performance even better.

<p>There are some important programming differences between
interrupt-driven drivers and polling drivers.  To understand
this difference, you have to understand a little bit of how
system calls work under Unix.  The kernel is not a separate
task under Unix. Rather, it is as if each process has a copy of
the kernel.  When a process executes a system call, it does not
transfer control to another process, but rather, the process
changes execution modes, and is said to be ``in kernel mode.''
In this mode, it executes kernel code which is trusted to be
safe.

<p>In kernel mode, the process can still access the user-space
memory that it was previously executing in, which is done
through a set of macros: <tt>get_fs_*()</tt> and
<tt>memcpy_fromfs()</tt> read user-space memory, and
<tt>put_fs_*()</tt> and <tt>memcpy_tofs()</tt> write to
user-space memory.  Because the process is still running, but
in a different mode, there is no question of where in memory to
put the data, or where to get it from.  However, when an
interrupt occurs, any process might currently be running, so
these macros cannot be used--if they are, they will either
write over random memory space of the running process or cause
the kernel to panic.

<p>Instead, when scheduling the interrupt, a driver must also
provide temporary space in which to put the information, and
then sleep.  When the interrupt-driven part of the driver has
filled up that temporary space, it wakes up the process, which
copies the information from that temporary space into the
process' user space and returns.  In a block device driver,
this temporary space is automatically provided by the buffer
cache mechanism, but in a character device driver, the driver
is responsible for allocating it itself.

<h4>The sleep-wakeup mechanism</h4>

<b>[Begin by giving a general description of how sleeping is used
and what it does.  This should mention things like all processes
sleeping on an event are woken at once, and then they contend for the
event again, etc...]</b>

<p>Perhaps the best way to try to understand the Linux
sleep-wakeup mechanism is to read the source for the
<tt>__sleep_on()</tt> function, used to implement both the
<tt>sleep_on()</tt> and <tt>interruptible_sleep_on()</tt>
calls.
<pre>
static inline void __sleep_on(struct wait_queue **p, int state)
{
    unsigned long flags;
    struct wait_queue wait = { current, NULL };

    if (!p)
        return;
    if (current == task[0])
        panic("task[0] trying to sleep");
    current-&gt;state = state;
    add_wait_queue(p, &wait);
    save_flags(flags);
    sti();
    schedule();
    remove_wait_queue(p, &amp;wait);
    restore_flags(flags);
}
</pre>

<p>A <tt>wait_queue</tt> is a circular list of pointers to task
structures, defined in <tt>&lt;linux/wait.h&gt;</tt> to be
<pre>
struct wait_queue {
    struct task_struct * task;
    struct wait_queue * next;
};
</pre>
<tt>state</tt> is either <tt>TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE</tt> or
<tt>TASK_UNINTERUPTIBLE</tt>, depending on whether or not the
sleep should be interruptable by such things as system calls.
In general, the sleep should be interruptible if the device is
a slow one; one which can block indefinitely, including
terminals and network devices or pseudodevices.

<p><tt>add_wait_queue()</tt> turns off interrupts, if they were
enabled, and adds the new <tt>struct wait_queue</tt> declared
at the beginning of the function to the list <tt>p</tt>.  It
then recovers the original interrupt state (enabled or
disabled), and returns.

<p><tt>save_flags()</tt> is a macro which saves the process
flags in its argument.  This is done to preserve the previous
state of the interrupt enable flag.  This way, the
<tt>restore_flags()</tt> later can restore the interrupt state,
whether it was enabled or disabled. <tt>sti()</tt> then allows
interrupts to occur, and <tt>schedule()</tt> finds a new
process to run, and switches to it.  Schedule will not choose
this process to run again until the state is changed to
<tt>TASK_RUNNING</tt> by <tt>wake_up()</tt> called on the same
wait queue, <tt>p</tt>, or conceivably by something else.

<p>The process then removes itself from the
<tt>wait_queue</tt>, restores the orginal interrupt condition
with <tt>restore_flags()</tt>, and returns.

<p>Whenever contention for a resource might occur, there needs
to be a pointer to a <tt>wait_queue</tt> associated with that
resource.  Then, whenever contention does occur, each process
that finds itself locked out of access to the resource sleeps
on that resource's <tt>wait_queue</tt>.  When any process is
finished using a resource for which there is a
<tt>wait_queue</tt>, it should wake up and processes that might
be sleeping on that <tt>wait_queue</tt>, probably by calling
<tt>wake_up()</tt>, or possibly
<tt>wake_up_interruptible()</tt>.

<p>If you don't understand why a process might want to sleep,
or want more details on when and how to structure this
sleeping, I urge you to buy one of the operating systems
textbooks listed in the
<A HREF="../bib/bib.html">Annotated Bibliography</a> and look up
<b>mutual exclusion</b> and <b>deadlock</b>.

<h4>More advanced sleeping</h4>

<p>If the <tt>sleep_on()</tt>/<tt>wake_up()</tt> mechanism in
Linux does not satisfy your device driver needs, you can code
your own versions of <tt>sleep_on()</tt> and <tt>wake_up()</tt>
that fit your needs.  For an example of this, look at the
serial device driver (drivers/char/serial.c) in function
<tt>block_til_ready()</tt>, where quite a bit has to be done
between the <tt>add_wait_queue()</tt> and the
<tt>schedule()</tt>.

<h4>The VFS</h4>

<p>The Virtual Filesystem Switch, or <b>VFS</b>, is the
mechanism which allows Linux to mount many different
filesystems at the same time.  In the first versions of Linux,
all filesystem access went straight into routines which
understood the <tt>minix</tt> filesystem.  To make it possible
for other filesystems to be written, filesystem calls had to
pass through a layer of indirection which would switch the call
to the routine for the correct filesystem.  This was done by
some generic code which can handle generic cases and a
structure of pointers to functions which handle specific cases.
One structure is of interest to the device driver writer; the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure.

<p>From /usr/include/linux/fs.h:
<pre>
struct file_operations {
    int  (*lseek)   (struct inode *, struct file *, off_t, int);
    int  (*read)    (struct inode *, struct file *, char *, int);
    int  (*write)   (struct inode *, struct file *, char *, int);
    int  (*readdir) (struct inode *, struct file *, struct dirent *, int count);
    int  (*select)  (struct inode *, struct file *, int, select_table *);
    int  (*ioctl)   (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned int);
    int  (*mmap)    (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned long, size_t, int, unsigned long);
    int  (*open)    (struct inode *, struct file *);
    void (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
};
</pre>
Essentially, this structure constitutes a parital list of
the functions that you may have to write to create your driver.

<p>This section details the actions and requirements of the
functions in the <tt>file_operations</tt> structure.  It
documents all the arguments that these functions take.  <b>[It
should also detail all the defaults, and cover more carefully
the possible return values.]</b>

<h4>The <tt>lseek()</tt> function</h4>

<p>This function is called when the system call
<tt>lseek()</tt> is called on the device special file
representing your device.  An understanding of what the system
call <tt>lseek()</tt> does should be sufficient to explain this
function, which moves to the desired offset.  It takes these
four arguments:
<dl>
<dt><tt>struct inode * inode</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the inode structure for this device.
<dt><tt>struct file * file</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the file structure for this device.
<dt><tt>off_t offset</tt>
<dd>Offset <b>from origin</b> to move to.
<dt><tt>int origin</tt>
<dd>0 = take the offset from absolute offset 0 (the beginning).<br>
1 = take the offset from the current position.<br>
2 = take the offset from the end.
</dl>
<tt>lseek()</tt> returns <tt>-errno</tt> on error, or the absolute
position (&gt;= 0) after the lseek.

<p>If there is no <tt>lseek()</tt>, the kernel will take the
default action, which is to modify the <tt>file->f_pos</tt>
element.  For an <tt>origin</tt> of 2, the default action is to
return <tt>-EINVAL</tt> if <tt>file->f_inode</tt> is NULL,
otherwise it sets <tt>file->f_pos</tt> to
<tt>file->f_inode->i_size</tt> + <tt>offset</tt>.  Because of
this, if <tt>lseek()</tt> should return an error for your
device, you must write an <tt>lseek()</tt> function which
returns that error.

<h4>The <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> functions</h4>

<p>The read and write functions read and write a character
string to the device.  If there is no <tt>read()</tt> or
<tt>write()</tt> function in the <tt>file_operations</tt>
structure registered with the kernel, and the device is a
character device, <tt>read()</tt> or <tt>write()</tt> system
calls, respectively, will return <tt>-EINVAL</tt>.  If the
device is a block device, these functions should not be
implemented, as the VFS will route requests through the buffer
cache, which will call your strategy routine.  The
<tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> functions take these
arguments:
<dl>
<dt><tt>struct inode * inode</tt>
<dd>This is a pointer to the inode of the device special file which was
accessed.  From this, you can do several things, based on the
<tt>struct inode</tt> declaration about 100 lines into
/usr/include/linux/fs.h.  For instance, you can find the minor number
of the file by this construction: <tt>unsigned int minor =
MINOR(inode->i_rdev);</tt> The definition of the <tt>MINOR</tt> macro is in
<tt><linux/fs.h></tt>, as are many other useful definitions.  Read fs.h
and a few device drivers for more details, and see
<A HREF="reference.html">Supporting Functions</a>
for a short description.  <tt>inode->i_mode</tt>
can be used to find the mode of the file, and there are macros
available for this, as well.
<dt><tt>struct file * file</tt>
<dd>Pointer to file structure for this device.
<dt><tt>char * buf</tt>
<dd>This is a buffer of characters to read or write.  It is
located in <i>user-space</i> memory, and therefore must be
accessed using the <tt>get_fs*(), put_fs*(),</tt> and
<tt>memcpy*fs()</tt> macros detailed in <A
HREF="reference.html">Supporting Functions</a>.  User-space
memory is inaccessible during an interrupt, so if your driver
is interrupt driven, you will have to copy the contents of your
buffer into a queue.
<dt><tt>int count</tt>
<dd>This is a count of characters in <tt>buf</tt> to
be read or written.  It is the size of <tt>buf</tt>, and is how you know
that you have reached the end of <tt>buf</tt>, as <tt>buf</tt> is not
guaranteed to be null-terminated.
</dl>

<h4>The <tt>readdir()</tt> function</h4>

<p>This function is another artifact of
<tt>file_operations</tt> being used for implementing
filesystems as well as device drivers.  Do not implement it.
The kernel will return <tt>-ENOTDIR</tt> if the system call
<tt>readdir()</tt> is called on your device special file.

<h4>The <tt>select()</tt> function</h4>

<p>The <tt>select()</tt> function is generally most useful with
character devices.  It is usually used to multiplex reads
without polling--the application calls the <tt>select()</tt>
system call, giving it a list of file descriptors to watch, and
the kernel reports back to the program on which file descriptor
has woken it up.  It is also used as a timer.  However, the
<tt>select()</tt> function in your device driver is not
directly called by the system call <tt>select()</tt>, and so
the <tt>file_operations</tt> <tt>select()</tt> only needs to do
a few things. Its arguments are:
<dl>
<dt><tt>struct inode * inode</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the inode structure for this device.
<dt><tt>struct file * file</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the file structure for this device.
<dt><tt>int sel_type</tt> 
<dd>The select type to perform:
<table border>
<tr><td><tt>SEL_IN</tt></td><td>read</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>SEL_OUT</tt></td><td>write</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>SEL_EX</tt></td><td>exception</td></tr>
</table>
<dt><tt>select_table * wait</tt>
<dd>If <tt>wait</tt> is not NULL and there is no error condition caused by
the select, <tt>select()</tt> should put the process to sleep, and
arrange to be woken up when the device becomes ready, usually through
an interrupt.  If <tt>wait</tt> is NULL, then the driver should quickly
see if the device is ready, and return even if it is not.  The
<tt>select_wait()</tt> function does this already.
</dl>

<p>If the calling program wants to wait until one of the
devices upon which it is selecting becomes available for the
operation it is interested in, the process will have to be put
to sleep until one of those operations becomes available.  This
does <b>not</b> require use of a <tt>sleep_on*()</tt> function,
however.  Instead the <tt>select_wait()</tt> function is used.
(See <A HREF="reference.html">Supporting Functions</a> for the
definition of the <tt>select_wait()</tt> function).  The sleep
state that <tt>select_wait()</tt> will cause is the same as
that of <tt>sleep_on_interruptible()</tt>, and, in fact,
<tt>wake_up_interruptible()</tt> is used to wake up the
process.

<p>However, <tt>select_wait()</tt> will not make the process go
to sleep right away.  It returns directly, and the
<tt>select()</tt> function you wrote should then return.  The
process isn't put to sleep until the system call
<tt>sys_select()</tt>, which originall called your
<tt>select()</tt> function, uses the information given to it by
the <tt>select_wait()</tt> function to put the process to
sleep. <tt>select_wait()</tt> adds the process to the wait
queue, but <tt>do_select()</tt> (called from
<tt>sys_select()</tt>) actually puts the process to sleep by
changing the process state to <tt>TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE</tt> and
calling <tt>schedule()</tt>.

<p>The first argument to <tt>select_wait()</tt> is the same
<tt>wait_queue</tt> that should be used for a
<tt>sleep_on()</tt>, and the second is the
<tt>select_table</tt> that was passed to your <tt>select()</tt>
function.

<p>After having explained all this in excruciating detail, here
are two rules to follow:
<ol>
<li>Call <tt>select_wait()</tt> if the device is not ready, and return 0.
<li>Return 1 if the device is ready.
</ol>

<p>If you provide a <tt>select()</tt> function, do not provide
timeouts by setting <tt>current-&gt;timeout</tt>, as the
<tt>select()</tt> mechanism uses <tt>current-&gt;timeout</tt>,
and the two methods cannot co-exist, as there is only one
<tt>timeout</tt> for each process.  Instead, consider using a
timer to provide timeouts.  See the description of the
<tt>add_timer()</tt> function in
<A HREF="reference.html">Supporting Functions</a>
for details.

<h4>The <tt>ioctl()</tt> function</h4>

<p>The <tt>ioctl()</tt> function processes ioctl calls.  The
structure of your <tt>ioctl()</tt> function will be: first
error checking, then one giant (possibly nested) switch
statement to handle all possible ioctls.  The ioctl number is
passed as <tt>cmd</tt>, and the argument to the ioctl is passed
as <tt>arg</tt>.  It is good to have an understanding of how
<tt>ioctls</tt> ought to work before making them up.  If you
are not sure about your ioctls, do not feel ashamed to ask
someone knowledgeable about it, for a few reasons: you may not
even need an ioctl for your purpose, and if you do need an
ioctl, there may be a better way to do it than what you have
thought of.  Since ioctls are the least regular part of the
device interface, it takes perhaps the most work to get this
part right.  Take the time and energy you need to get it right.

<p>The first thing you need to do is look in
Documentation/ioctl-number.txt, read it, and pick an unused number.
Then go from there.
<dl>
<dt><tt>struct inode * inode</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the inode structure for this device.
<dt><tt>struct file * file</tt>
<dd>Pointer to the file structure for this device.
<dt><tt>unsigned int cmd</tt>
<dd>This is the ioctl command.  It is
generally used as the switch variable for a case statement.
<dt><tt>unsigned int arg</tt>
<dd>This is the argument to the command.
This is user defined.   Since this is the same size as a
<tt>(void *)</tt>, this can be used as a pointer to user space, accessed
through the fs register as usual.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>Returns:</b>
<dd><tt>-errno</tt> on error<br>
Every other return is user-defined.
</dl>

If the <tt>ioctl()</tt> slot in the <tt>file_operations</tt> structure is
not filled in, the VFS will return <tt>-EINVAL</tt>.  However, in
all cases, if <tt>cmd</tt> is one of <tt>FIOCLEX</tt>, <tt>FIONCLEX</tt>,
<tt>FIONBIO</tt>, or <tt>FIOASYNC</tt>, default processing will be done:
<dl>
<dt><tt>FIOCLEX</tt> (0x5451)
<dd>Sets the close-on-exec bit.
<dt><tt>FIONCLEX</tt> (0x5450)
<dd>Clears the close-on-exec bit.
<dt><tt>FIONBIO</tt> (0x5421)
<dd>If <tt>arg</tt> is non-zero, set <tt>O_NONBLOCK</tt>,
otherwise clear <tt>O_NONBLOCK</tt>.
<dt><tt>FIOASYNC</tt> (0x5452)
<dd>If <tt>arg</tt> is non-zero, set <tt>O_SYNC</tt>,
otherwise clear <tt>O_SYNC</tt>.  <tt>O_SYNC</tt> is not yet implemented,
but it is documented here and parsed in the kernel for completeness.
</dl>
Note that you have to avoid these four numbers when creating
your own ioctls, since if they conflict, the VFS ioctl code
will interpret them as being one of these four, and act
appropriately, causing a very hard-to-track-down bug.

<h4>The <tt>mmap()</tt> function</h4>

<dl>
<dt><tt>struct inode * inode</tt>
<dd>Pointer to inode structure for device.
<dt><tt>struct file * file</tt>
<dd>Pointer to file structure for device.
<dt><tt>unsigned long addr</tt>
<dd>Beginning of address in main memory
to <tt>mmap()</tt> into.
<dt><tt>size_t len</tt>
<dd>Length of memory to <tt>mmap()</tt>.
<dt><tt>int prot</tt>
<dd>One of:
<table border>
<tr><td><tt>PROT_READ</tt></td><td>region can be read.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>PROT_WRITE</tt></td><td>region can be written.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>PROT_EXEC</tt></td><td>region can be executed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>PROT_NONE</tt></td><td>region cannot be accessed.</td></tr>
</table>
<dt><tt>unsigned long off</tt>
<dd>Offset in the file to <tt>mmap()</tt> from.
This address in the file will be mapped to address <tt>addr</tt>.
</dl>

<h4>The <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>release()</tt> functions</h4>

<dl>
<dt><tt>struct inode * inode</tt>
<dd>Pointer to inode structure for device.
<dt><tt>struct file * file</tt>
<dd>Pointer to file structure for device.
</dl>

<p><tt>open()</tt> is called when a device special files is
opened.  It is the policy mechanism responsible for ensuring
consistency.  If only one process is allowed to open the device
at once, <tt>open()</tt> should lock the device, using whatever
locking mechanism is appropriate, usually setting a bit in some
state variable to mark it as busy.  If a process already is
using the device (if the busy bit is already set) then
<tt>open()</tt> should return <tt>-EBUSY</tt>.  If more than
one process may open the device, this function is responsible
to set up any necessary queues that would not be set up in
<tt>write()</tt>.  If no such device exists, <tt>open()</tt>
should return <tt>-ENODEV</tt> to indicate this. Return 0 on
success.

<p><tt>release()</tt> is called only when the process closes
its last open file descriptor on the files. <b>[I am not sure
this is true; it might be called on every close.]</b> If
devices have been marked as busy, <tt>release()</tt> should
unset the busy bits if appropriate.  If you need to clean up
<tt>kmalloc()</tt>'ed queues or reset devices to preserve their
sanity, this is the place to do it.  If no <tt>release()</tt>
function is defined, none is called.

<h4>The <tt>init()</tt> function</h4>

<p>This function is not actually included in the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure, but you are required to
implement it, because it is this function that registers the
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure with the VFS in the first
place--without this function, the VFS could not route any
requests to the driver.  This function is called when the
kernel first boots and is configuring itself.  The init
function then detects all devices.  You will have to call your
<tt>init()</tt> function from the correct place: for a
character device, this is <tt>chr_dev_init()</tt> in
drivers/char/mem.c.

<p>While the <tt>init()</tt> function runs, it registers your
driver by calling the proper registration function.  For
character devices, this is <tt>register_chrdev()</tt>. (See
<A HREF="reference.html">Supporting Functions</a>
for more information on the registration functions.)
<tt>register_chrdev()</tt> takes three arguments: the major
device number (an int), the ``name'' of the device (a string),
and the address of the <tt><i>device</i>_fops</tt>
<tt>file_operations</tt> structure.

<p>When this is done, and a character or block special file is
accessed, the VFS filesystem switch automagically routes the
call, whatever it is, to the proper function, if a function
exists.  If the function does not exist, the VFS routines take
some default action.

<p>The <tt>init()</tt> function usually displays some
information about the driver, and usually reports all hardware
found.  All reporting is done via the <tt>printk()</tt>
function.
