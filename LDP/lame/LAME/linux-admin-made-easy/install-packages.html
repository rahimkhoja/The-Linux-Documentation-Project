>Next, you'll be presented with a list of system components and asked
to specify which ones should be installed.  If you are an experienced
Linux user, you can pick and choose according to your needs.  If you are
new to Linux, you'll likely want to select the bottom option,
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Everything"</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>What I usually do is select the components I know I'll need, and
then enable the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Select individual
packages</TT
>"</SPAN
> option, which allows me to control the
installation in finer detail.</P
><P
>Once you have chosen your desired components, select
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Ok</TT
>"</SPAN
> to begin installation.  If you have
enabled the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Select individual packages</TT
>"</SPAN
>,
you'll be asked the specify which individual packages should be
installed.  This is fairly straightforward, and if you are unsure of what
a given package is for, you can press the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#60;<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F1</B
>&#62;</TT
> key for a brief
description of what it does.</P
><P
>Don't worry if you make a mistake choosing (or not choosing) a
package or two.  After all, all the packages are on your CD-ROM (or other
source media), so you can use the handy Red Hat RPM tool to make
adjustments after your system is up and running (see <A
HREF="using-rpm.html"
>Section 10.1</A
> for details).</P
><P
>After you have chosen the packages you wish to install, the
installation program will now format the partitions you have defined.  
This may take several minutes, especially for larger partitions or if
you've enabled bad block checking, so please don't think your system has
frozen during this procedure!</P
><P
>After the format completes, Red Hat Linux will begin installation of
the selected packages.  This should take between five and fifteen minutes
to complete, depending on the speed of your system.</P
