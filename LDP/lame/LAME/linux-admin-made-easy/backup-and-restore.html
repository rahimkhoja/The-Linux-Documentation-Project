>Performing regular backups should be considered one of a responsible
system administrator's top priorities.  Although Linux is an extremely
reliable operating system, failures can, do, and probably will occur.  
They may be caused by hardware failure, power outages, or other unforeseen
problems.</P
><P
>More likely will be those problems caused by human error, resulting in
undesired changes to, or even deletions of, crucial files.  If you are
hosting users on your system, you will most certainly be requested to
restore an inadvertently deleted file or two.</P
><P
>If you perform regular backups, preferably on a daily basis (at least
for user files which are updated often), you will hopefully reduce the
possibility of, and increase your recovery from, such file lossage.</P
><P
>The safest method of doing backups is to record them on separate media,
such as tape, removable drive, writeable CD, etc., and then store your
backup sets in a location separate from your Linux system.  Sometimes this
may not be practical -- perhaps you do not have a fire-proof vault in
which you can store your backup tapes!  Or perhaps you do not have access
to such an external backup system in the first place.  Nonetheless, backups
can still be performed, albeit on a slightly limited basis.</P
><P
>At my place of employment, I perform backups on several Linux
servers. Depending on the situation, some of these backup sets are
written to tapes, others are written to a separate server over the
network, while still others are simply written to a separate disk
partition (for example, in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/archive/</TT
></TT
>'' file system) by an
automatic cron job (perhaps because the server is in a remote location,
for which a daily visit to perform a tape backup is impractical or
impossible).</P
><P
>At home, I do not have an external backup system, nor do I have
massive amounts of available disk space to write a backup image.  
Therefore, I instead back up only my user files on
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/</TT
></TT
>'' as well as some
customized configuration files in
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/</TT
></TT
>'', writing the backup set
to a separate disk partition.</P
