><P
>To begin setting up your new Red Hat system, either boot from the
installation CD, or insert the installation diskette in the system's A:
drive, and reboot or power-on the system.  After a few moments, the Red
Hat installation program screen should appear.</P
><P
>In most cases, you can just press <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&#60;Enter&#62;</TT
>
to begin the installation process, but if you are a more experienced user
who knows exactly how your hardware devices should be set up, you can
enter ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>expert</TT
>'' for the additional information and
prompts this feature provides.  (If you do nothing, the default
installation procedure will start in about 10 to 15 seconds after the
installation screen first appears.)</P
><P
>You will then be asked to choose your language (usually
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>English</TT
>"</SPAN
>) and your keyboard type (even
in Canada I choose <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>US 101-key</TT
>"</SPAN
>), as well
as where you are installing from (such as from your CD-ROM or over the
network). Red Hat is very flexible in where it can be installed
from.</P
><P
>Most likely you will choose ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Local CDROM</TT
>'' to
install from your Red Hat CD-ROM (which should be inserted into your
CD-ROM device).  However, if your system is not equipped with a CD-ROM
device, there are a number of other installation methods you can
choose.</P
><P
>If you have another Linux system (or any other operating system that
supports NFS file mounting), you can use ``NFS'' to install from an NFS
mount.  To do this, you'll need to have your CD-ROM mounted in the other
system (or otherwise have the Red Hat distribution tree somewhere on the
other system -- it is possible to download everything via FTP and then
install from your other system's hard drive), make sure you have an entry
in your /etc/exports file allowing access by the new system to the
appropriate directory (see <A
HREF="nfs-services.html"
>Section 7.6</A
> for details
on how to set up and use NFS), and then enter the appropriate details.  
Here's an example walk-through:</P

>Now, from your new system, you can choose
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NFS</TT

to provide information on your network card, as well as your IP settings.  
You'll likely use static IP settings if your system is sitting on a local
LAN, or DHCP settings if, for example, your system is connected to a
cable modem.  Enter the settings as appropriate for your new
system.</P
></LI

STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"

>You'll then be asked to enter the NFS server name and Red
Hat directory. For our example system, we would type in
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>spock</TT
>'' as the NFS server name, and
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/mnt/cdrom/</TT
></TT

directory.</P

><P
>There are other ways of installing Red Hat, such as using a Samba
(Windows-style networking) connection, from an existing partition (such
as your DOS or Windows 95 partition) on your hard drive, or via FTP.  
Check the Red Hat users guide for more details on installing using these
methods, or just try to struggle through them (the procedures are really
not very difficult!)</P
><P
>Once you have chosen your installation source, Red Hat will ask you
if you wish to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install</TT
>"</SPAN
> or
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Upgrade</TT
>"</SPAN
> your system.  As you are
installing a new system, you should choose
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Install</TT
>"</SPAN
>.  (As an aside, I'm a fairly
anal person who <EM
>never</EM
> upgrades new distribution
releases over existing systems -- I guess having suffered through so many
problems with Microsoft products I have developed a significant mistrust
for upgrading systems as a whole.  I prefer to install from scratch, and
simply restore from backup my personal/user and local site files.)</P
><P
>The installation program will then ask you if you have a SCSI
adapter.  If you answer yes, you'll be asked to choose the appropriate
driver.  In some circumstances, Red Hat will be able to detect your
adapter automatically.</P
><P
>Next, you'll be asked to set up your file systems (ie. partition
one or more drives for Linux).  There are two tools available for setting
up these partitions, including the Red Hat-supplied <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Disk
Druid</TT
>"</SPAN
>, and the standard Linux
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/fdisk</TT
>"</SPAN
> utility.</P
><P
>Both tools are similar in function, allowing you to specify the
partition types and sizes.  However, Disk Druid seems to be a bit more
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"user friendly"</SPAN
>, and a bit more complete than fdisk.  In
fact, if you use fdisk to partition your drives, you'll then be presented
with the Disk Druid screen for specifying your mount points
<EM
>anyway</EM
>.  That being said, as an ex-Slackware user, I
personally always use fdisk -- force of habit, I guess!  :-)</P
><P
>The next section will detail how and why you should set up your partition
information.</P
