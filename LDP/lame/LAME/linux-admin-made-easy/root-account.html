><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
> account is the most privileged account on a
Unix system.  This account gives you the ability to carry out all facets
of system administration, including adding accounts, changing user
passwords, examining log files, installing software, etc.</P
><P
>When using this account it is crucial to be as careful as possible.  
The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
> account has no security restrictions imposed upon
it.  This means it is easy to perform administrative duties without
hassle.  However, the system assumes you know what you are doing, and will
do exactly what you request -- no questions asked.  Therefore it is easy,
with a mistyped command, to wipe out crucial system files.</P
><P
>When you are signed in as, or acting as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
>, the
shell prompt displays '#' as the last character (if you are using bash).  
This is to serve as a warning to you of the absolute power of this
account.</P
><P
>The rule of thumb is, never sign in as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
> unless
absolutely necessary.  While <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
>, type commands carefully
and double-check them before pressing return.  Sign off from the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root"</SPAN
> account as soon as you have accomplished the task you
signed on for.  Finally, (as with any account but especially important
with this one), keep the password secure!</P
