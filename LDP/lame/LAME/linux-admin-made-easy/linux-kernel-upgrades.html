></H1
><P
>From time to time it may be wise to upgrade your Linux kernel.  
This will allow you to keep up with the new features and bug fixes as they
become available.  Or, perhaps, you are running Linux on new or specialty
hardware, or wish to enable certain features for which a custom kernel is
needed.</P
><P
>This section will describe upgrading and customizing a new kernel.  
It isn't as difficult as you might think!</P
><P
>Announcements of new kernel versions can be obtained through various
sources, including the <A
HREF="news:comp.os.linux.announce"
TARGET="_top"
>comp.os.linux.announce</A
> newsgroup, as well as on the
<A
HREF="http://freshmeat.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://freshmeat.net/</A
>
and <A
HREF="http://slashdot.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://slashdot.org/</A
>
web sites.</P
><P
>Please note that there are currently two <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"streams"</SPAN
> of
kernel development -- one stream is considered <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"stable"</SPAN
>
releases, while the other stream is considered <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"development"</SPAN
>
releases.  For mission critical applications such as an Internet server,
it is highly recommended that you use the stable releases and stay away
from the development kernels.</P
><P
>The difference between the two streams is that, with the development
kernels, new as-yet untested hardware drivers, filesystems, and other
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"cutting edge"</SPAN
> developments are introduced on a regular basis. 
These kernels are for use by hackers only -- people who don't mind having
to reboot their system, should a kernel bug rear its ugly head.</P
><P
>The stable kernels introduce new features and drivers only after they have
been thoroughly tested.  Minor releases in this stream also serve to clean
up any remaining bugs that are found and corrected.</P
><P
>The two streams use version numbers which are numbered differently to
help distinguish between them.  The stable kernels are numbered with
the second number even (eg. 2.0.35, 2.0.36, 2.2.4) while the development
kernels are numbered with the second number odd (eg. 2.1.120, 2.1.121,
2.3.0).</P
><P
>The latest stable kernel is always made available in source as well
as pre-compiled binary formats on the <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/updates/"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/updates/</A
> FTP site.  Download the
desired kernel packages for your version and platform (for example, you
would want to navigate to the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/6.1/i386/</TT
></TT
>'' directory and
download the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>kernel-*.i386.rpm</TT
></TT
>''
files for the 6.1 version on the Intel platform).</P
><DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
><B
>Note: </B
>Note: You do not need to download the kernel sources file unless you
are planning on building a custom kernel yourself (see <A
HREF="kernel-custom.html"
>Section 10.6</A
> for details on building a custom
kernel).</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV
><P
>Sometimes, you may find it necessary to use a kernel that has not
yet been made available as an RPM.  In this case, you can find the latest
kernels from the <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.kernel.org</A
> FTP site, in the
<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/"
TARGET="_top"
>/pub/linux/kernel/</A
> directory.  Change to the appropriate major
version subdirectory (eg.
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>v2.0</TT
></TT
>''), which contains all
kernel releases up to the most current one.  Download the desired kernel
package (for example, the compressed tarball for version 2.0.36 would be
called ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>linux-2.0.36.tar.gz</TT
></TT
>''
for the Intel platform) and untar it in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src</TT
></TT
>'' directory.</P
><DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
><B
>Note: </B
>Note: Most user-installed applications not installed from RPM should
be untarred under the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/src/</TT
></TT
>'' directory by
convention, but this is a kernel tree so we'll make an exception in this
case. :-)</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV
><P
>Please be aware that if you decide to upgrade your kernel by
downloading a tarball, you will most certainly need to configure, compile,
and install it yourself.  Unless you have special needs that require the
very latest development kernel, I <EM
>strongly</EM
> recommend
you upgrade your kernel through Red Hat-provided RPM files -- these are
preconfigured and precompiled for you, although you can compile a custom
kernel from RPM files as well should you wish.</P
