><P
>I've been using Linux for several years, and I like to think I know
a bit about the operating system and what it can and cannot do.  As I'm an
avid USENET reader, I follow the latest developments and of course, the
various flame-wars that invariably crop up (those darn cross-posting
advocacy people! ;-) ).  I've seen my share of myths (often called
<EM
>FUD</EM
> -- <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"</SPAN
> which
seems to be a common tactic used by commercial technology vendors to
frighten their market away from competing technologies) that more than a
few people believe.  So, let me try to run down a few of the more common
ones and attempt to shatter them.  :-)</P

><P
>Some people seem to have the notion that, because a piece of
software was written by volunteers with no profit motive in mind, that the
results must clearly be inferior to commercial-grade offerings.</P
><P
>This may have been true in the past (I mean, there
<EM
>was</EM
> a lot of freeware which was absolute garbage in
the DOS and early Windows world), but it is most certainly not true in
recent days.</P
><P
>The power of the Internet has made it possible to bring together
some of the brightest minds in the globe, allowing collaboration on
projects they find interesting.  The people who have put a hand into
developing Linux or the thousands of GNU utilities and applications
packages are from a diverse background, and all of them have different
personal reasons for wanting to contribute.</P
><P
>Some are hard-core hackers who develop for the love of coding,
others have a need for something (for example, a network traffic monitor
for a LAN at work) and decide to write it themselves, others are academics
and computer scientists who are using Linux for its research
qualities.</P
><P
>Unlike a commercial offering where a package is developed and sold,
source code excluded, to the end-user, code used in Linux is scrutinized,
debugged, and improved upon by anyone who has the interest and ability.
This act of peer-review is one of the reasons that Linux offers the high
reliability and high performance that it does.</P
><P
>Don't forget:  The Internet itself was built and runs almost
exclusively on Open Source projects.  The e-mail you exchange on a daily
basis with people around the world has an 80% chance of being handled on
one or both ends by Sendmail, the web pages you browse while
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Surfin' the Web"</SPAN
> are served to you by Apache on over 50% of
the world's web sites.  Reliable enough for you?</P

><P
>Hearing this myth somewhat sickens me.  And supposedly the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"other"</SPAN
> vendors <EM
>do</EM
> offer support?  I've
had personal experience with one very popular commercial operating system,
where the vendor's so-called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"support"</SPAN
> was completely
useless.</P
><P
>First of all, there <EM
>is</EM
> support for Linux.  
Yes, commercial support.  There are some companies that can provide as
much support as you are willing to pay for; offering telephone and e-mail
support, many offering to come right to your door to deal with the
problem!</P
><P
>However, in 99% of the situations you will run into with Linux, you
will be able to accomplish what you wish if you can simply get the answer
to a question or two.  This is easily accomplished on USENET or on any of
the many mailing lists available!</P
><P
>I've never had a problem I couldn't find a solution to, by either
searching on <A
HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.dejanews.com/</A
>, or by asking in one of the
comp.os.linux.* newsgroups. Normally I can receive an answer to any of the
support issues I ask about within three to twelve hours of my
posting.</P
><P
>Another interesting aspect of Linux is that, because the source code
for the entire kernel and most of the other operating system components is
freely available, key-support issues such as security, denial of service,
or CPU bugs (such as Intel's <EM
>F00F</EM
> fatal exception)
are tracked down and solved <EM
>very</EM
> quickly -- usually
an order of magnitude faster than solutions offered for similar or
identical problems on the commercial offerings.  So, where's the
commercial support!?</P
><P

beyond the scope of this document.  However, for further myth debunking,
