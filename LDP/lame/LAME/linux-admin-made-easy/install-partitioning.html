></H1
><P
>Why partition, anyway?  Well, although it is possible to get a
perfectly functioning Linux system running on a single-partition system,
and, in fact, is a bit easier to configure this way, there are a number of
benefits from partitioning one or more of your storage devices into
multiple partitions.</P
><P
>While it is true that Linux will operate just fine on a disk with
only one large partition defined, there are several advantages to
partitioning your disk for at least the four main file systems (root,
usr, home, and swap).  These include:</P
><P
>First, it may reduce the time required to perform file system checks
(both upon bootup and when doing a manual fsck), because these checks can
be done in parallel.  (By the way, <EM
>NEVER</EM
> run an fsck
on a mounted file system!!!  You will almost certainly regret what happens
to it.  The exception to this is if the file system is mounted read-only,
in which case it is safe to do so.)  Also, file system checks are a lot
easier to do on a system with multiple partitions.  For example, if I knew
my /home partition had problems, I could simply unmount it, perform a file
system check, and then remount the repaired file system (as opposed to
booting my system with a rescue diskette into single-user mode and doing
the repairs).</P
><P
>Second, with multiple partitions, you can, if you wish, mount one or
more of your partitions as read-only.  For example, if you decide that
everything in /usr will not be touched even by root, you can mount the
/usr partition as read-only.</P
><P
>Finally, the most important benefit that partitioning provides is
protection of your file systems.  If something should happen to a file
system (either through user error or system failure), on a partitioned
system you would probably only lose files on a single file system.  On a
non-partitioned system, you would probably lose them on all file
systems.</P
><P
>This little fact can be a big plus.  For example, if your root
partition is so corrupted you can't boot, you can basically boot from the
rescue diskette set, mount your root partition, and copy what you can (or
restore from backup; see <A
HREF="backup-and-restore.html"
>Chapter 8</A
> for
details on how files can be backed up and restored), to another partition
such as home, and then reboot once again using the emergency boot disk,
typing <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>mount root=/dev/hda3</TT
>"</SPAN
> (assuming the
partition containing your temporary root file system is on the third
partition of hda) and boot your fully functional Linux box.  Then you can
run an fsck on your unmounted corrupt root partition.</P
><P
>I <EM
>have</EM
> had personal experience in file system
catastrophies, and I was very grateful for having had the damage limited
due to the use of multiple partitions.</P
><P
>Finally, since Linux allows you to set up other operating system(s)
(such as Windows 95/98/NT, BeOS, or what-have-you), and then dual- (or
triple-, ...)  boot your system, you might wish to set up additional
partitions to take advantage of this.  Typically, you would want to set up
at least one separate partition for each operating system.  Linux includes
a decent boot loader (called LILO on Intel-based systems, although much
the same thing is available as MILO on Alpha, and SILO on Sparc) which
allows you to specify which operating system you want to boot at power on,
with a time-out default boot of your favorite operating system (probably
Linux, right?)</P
><P
>You should partition a disk (or disks) according to your needs.  In
my experience on Intel, Alpha, and Sparc platforms, for a fairly loaded
system (feature-wise), doing a fair amount of tasks (as a desktop system
at home, or as an Internet server at work), I have found the following
approximation of space works pretty effectively for determining a
partition size.</P

>Given:

A given disk of X Mb/Gb          (eg. 2 Gb)
(Or, more than one disk with a combined total of X Mb/Gb)

Calculate:

(swap) about double main RAM     (eg. 64 Mb system gets 128 Mb swap)
/ (root)  about 10% of available (eg. 200 Mb)
/home about 20% of available     (eg. 400 Mb)
/usr any remaining space         (eg. 1272 Mb)

/var (optional -- see below)
/boot (optional -- see below)
/archive (optional -- see below)</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Of course, the above amounts are approximate guidelines only.  
Obviously you are going to want to juggle those percentages around a bit
depending on what you are going to use your Linux system for.  If you are
going to be doing stuff like adding lots of bulky applications such as
WordPerfect or Netscape, or perhaps adding Japanese character support, you
would probably benefit from a bit more /usr space.</P
><P
>I <EM
>always</EM
> seem to have a lot of space available
on /home, so if your users aren't doing much (or you have imposed strict
quota sizes), or you aren't offering shell accounts and personal web
pages, etc., you probably could lower /home space and raise /usr.</P
><P
>Here is a description of the various mount points and file system
information, which may give you a better idea of how to best define your
partition sizes for your own needs:</P

><EM
>/ (root)</EM
> - used to store things like
temporary files, the Linux kernel and boot image, important binary files
(things that are needed before Linux can mount the /usr partition), and
more importantly log files, spool areas for print jobs and outgoing
e-mail, and user's incoming e-mail.  It is also used for temporary space
when performing certain operations, such as building RPM packages from
source RPM files.  Therefore, if you have a lot of users with a lot of
e-mail, or think you will need plenty of temporary space, you might want
more space available.  The partition type should be left as the default of
83 (Linux native).  In addition, you'll probably toggle the bootable flag
on this partition to allow boot information to be stored
here.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>/usr/</EM
> - should be the largest
partition, because most of the binary files required by Linux, as well as
any locally installed software, web pages, Squid proxy cache, Samba share
services, some locally-installed software log files, etc. are stored here.  
The partition type should be left as the default of 83 (Linux
native).</P

> - typically if you aren't
providing shell accounts to your users, you don't need to make this
partition very big.  The exception is if you are providing user home pages
(such as school web pages), in which case you might benefit from making
this partition larger.  Again, the partition type should be left as the
default of 83 (Linux native).</P

><EM
>(swap)</EM
> - Linux provides something
called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"virtual memory"</SPAN
> to make a larger amount of memory
available than the physical RAM installed in your system.  The swap
partition is used with main RAM by Linux to accomplish this.  As a rule of
thumb, your swap partition should be at least double the amount of
physical RAM installed in your system.</P
><P
>If you have more than one physical hard drive in your system, you
can create multiple swap partitions.  This can improve the performance of
swapping by taking advantage of parallel disk access.  For example, on a
256 Mb system with four drives, I would probably create four 128 Mb swap
partitions, for a total of 256 Mb RAM, 512 Mb swap (for a combined total
of 768 Mb available as virtual memory).  The partition type needs to be
changed to 82 (Linux swap).</P

>Note: </B
>Note: It is a common misconception that Linux has a 128 Mb
swap size limit.  This was true in the past, but in modern Linux
distributions, the size depends on your architecture (for example, Intel
systems can have swap sizes as large as 2 Gb).  Type ``<TT

>/var/</EM
> (optional) - You may wish to
consider splitting up your / (root) partition a bit further.  The /var
directory is used for a great deal of runtime storage, including mail
spools (both ingoing and outgoing), print jobs, process locks, etc.  
Having this directory mounted under / (root) may be a bit dangerous
because a large amount of incoming e-mail (for example), may suddenly fill
up the partition.  Since bad things can happen (eg. system crash?) when
the / (root) partition fills up, having /var on its own partition may
avoid such problems.  I've had success in taking whatever space I've
allocated to / (root), perhaps doubling it, and then creating separate
partitions for / (root) and for /var.  The partition type should be left
as the default of 83 (Linux native).</P

><EM
>/boot/</EM
> (optional) - In some
circumstances (such as a system set up in a software RAID configuration)
it may be necessary to have a separate partition from which to boot the
Linux system.  This partition would allow booting and then loading of
whatever drivers are required to read the other file systems.  The size of
this partition can be as small as a couple Mb; I recommend approximately
10 Mb (which should give you plenty of room to store the kernel, initial
RAMdisk image, and perhaps a backup kernel or two).  The partition type
should be left as the default of 83 (Linux native).</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: Bullet"
><P
><EM
>/archive/</EM
> (optional) - If you have
any extra space lying around, perhaps you would benefit from a partition
for a directory called, for example, /archive. You can then use the
/archive directory to store backup material, large or infrequently
accessed files, samba file services, or whatever else you can find a use
for it.  The partition type can be left as the default of 83 (Linux
native), or if you want to access it from both Linux as well as from
another operating system, you could change it to a different ID, such as 6
(DOS 16-bit &#62;=32M).</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>As extra drive(s) are added, further partitions can be added to the
new drives, mounted at various mount-points as required -- this means a
Linux system never needs to worry about running out of space.  As an
example, if in the future it is clear that sda6 is starting to get filled
up, we could add another drive, set a nicely sized partition with a
mount-point at /usr/local -- and then transfer all the information from
/usr/local over to the new drive.  But no system or application component
would <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

where it was located.</P
