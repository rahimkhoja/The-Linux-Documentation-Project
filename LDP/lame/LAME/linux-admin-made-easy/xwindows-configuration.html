>The X Window System, aka <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X"</SPAN
> (commonly and incorrectly
known by many as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X-Windows"</SPAN
>) is a GUI which sits on top of
Linux.  Unlike Microsoft Windows, the X Window System can look and operate
in a large variety of different ways.  It can operate very primitively or
very advanced, look beautiful or ugly, be sleek and fast or bloated and
slow (each of which are subjective qualities which cause as many arguments
among users as the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Linux vs. Microsoft NT"</SPAN
> debate seems
to).</P
><P
>Getting X working properly can range from simple to hair-pulling
complicated!  It is a common complaint among users who are new to Linux,
and I've fought with configuration settings countless times myself, so I'm
completely empathic about this.  Fortunately, such configuration is becoming
easier and more automated in the newer distributions of Linux.  In fact,
if you are using Red Hat 6.1 you will probably not have to worry about this
issue.</P
><P
>Although in a majority of cases X can be configured automatically,
there are exceptions; I would recommend you know or find out the type of
video card and amount of video RAM your system has installed, as well as
the type of monitor and its horizontal and vertical synch rates (this
information is usually available in the back pages of the monitor's users
guide, or can be found on the WWW).</P
