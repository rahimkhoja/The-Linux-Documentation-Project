log files are recycled, the available capacity stays fairly stable (an

>Tip: If this file-system is growing rapidly, concentrate your
efforts in the /var/spool/mail directory -- look for huge mailboxes
(something like ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>find /var/spool/mail -size +1000k</TT
>''
would display a list of mailboxes larger than 1Mb in size). If you find a
file much larger than 1,000,000 bytes in size, the user probably isn't
retrieving their mail, is on a high-volume mailing list, or their e-mail
package isn't configured to remove the mail from the server.  Contact the
user and/or clear the mail file, using <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

mailbox</TT
>"</SPAN

CLASS="LITERAL"

Joe Smith's mail box).  Also check the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

need to be cleaned out on an occasional basis (usually old tin* files left
over from aborted newsreader sessions, old print files, etc).</P

This is the largest file-system, and is also fairly slow-growth.  The log
files for the web pages may also be stored here, and grow in size; check
and trim them periodically as needed.  On my machines, at the beginning of
each month the current web log files are moved to month summary logs (eg.
access_log.11 for November's log entries).  At the end of the year these
logs are all deleted and the cycle starts again (which means each January
1st should see a fair improvement in available space).</P

``<TT

them).  There may be log file(s) that are getting too large (if, perhaps,
the web site received a high number of visits). If, however, the logs are
purged automatically on a regular basis as I have them, you shouldn't run
into any problems with space here (indeed, as the logs are used for
statistical analysis of my site's traffic I'd rather not have to delete
them if possible).  Another place to check for potentially deletable files
is in ``<TT

mounted on /dev/hda3, contains all the user directories and personal
files.  Unless you are giving out shell accounts, most of these will be
useless and inaccessible to the user (these directories are created when
each users' accounts are created, and can later be used to forward the
user's mail, etc.).  However shell account users, as well as any non-shell
accounts which have web pages (eg. personal web pages) will probably have
them stored here.  In addition, main server pages are stored here in the
/home/httpd directory under Red Hat, while other distributions usually
place them in the /usr file system (see <A

portion (approximately 70%) of this drive for disk-to-disk full current
