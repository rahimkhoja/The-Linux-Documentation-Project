>There is an excellent tool called ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>linuxconf</TT
>''
which can make many configuration issues easier to do.  Linuxconf runs on
whatever means of display environment it has available to it -- you can
run it from the console, over a telnet session, and as a GUI-based tool
under X and it will automatically start up in the appropriate
manner.</P

>If you need to adjust your system time, modify your network
settings, set up file systems, perform user administration, as well as
perform many other administrative and configuration duties, you should
give this tool a try. The only caveat I would give is that, at the time of
this writing, the GUI-based tool is still a bit <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"buggy"</SPAN
> and
at times may stop responding to mouse clicks.  However, this tool is a
promising work in progress, and future revisions should become quite
usable.</P
