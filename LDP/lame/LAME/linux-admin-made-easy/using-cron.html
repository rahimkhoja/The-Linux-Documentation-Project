>Like most Linux users, you may find it necessary to schedule
repetitive tasks to be run at a certain time.  Such tasks can occur as
frequently as once a minute, to as infrequently as once a year.  This
scheduling can be done by using the ``cron'' facilities.</P
><P
>The cron facilities as implemented in Linux are fairly similar to
those available in other Unix implementations.  However, Red Hat has
adopted a slightly different way of scheduling tasks than is usually done
in other distributions of Linux.  Just as in other distributions,
scheduling information is placed in the system
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>crontab</TT
></TT
>'' file (locating in the
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/</TT
></TT
>'' directory), using the
following format:</P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>minute hour day month year command</PRE
></TD

></TABLE
><P
>You can specify each time component as an integer number (eg. 1
through 12 for the months January through December), or specify one or
more components as ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>*</TT
>'' characters which will be
treated as wildcards (eg. * in the month component means the command will
run at the given day and time in <EM
>every</EM
> month.  Here
are some examples:</P

># Mail the system logs at 4:30pm every June 15th.
30 16 15 06 * for x in /var/log/*; do cat ${x} | mail postmaster; done

# Inform the administrator, at midnight, of the changing seasons.

00 00 20 12 * echo 'Time for 5 months of misery.  ;-('</PRE

>Note that commands which produce output to standard out (ie. a
terminal) such as the examples above using ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>echo</TT
>''
will have their output mailed to the ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>root</TT
>'' account.  
If you want to avoid this, simply pipe the output to the null device as
follows:</P

>00 06 * * * echo 'I bug the system administrator daily at 6:00am!' &#62;/dev/null</PRE

><P
>In addition to the standard ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>crontab</TT
>'' entries,
Red Hat adds several directories:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>/etc/cron.hourly/
/etc/cron.daily/
/etc/cron.weekly/</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>As their names suggest, executable files can be placed in any of
these directories, and will be executed on an hourly, daily, or weekly
basis. This saves a bit of time when setting up frequent tasks; just place
the executable script or program (or a symbolic link to one stores
elsewhere) in the appropriate directory and forget about it.</P
