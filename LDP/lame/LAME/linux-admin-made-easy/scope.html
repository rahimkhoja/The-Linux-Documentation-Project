>This documentation will attempt to summarize the installation and
configuration, as well as the day-to-day administrative and maintenance
procedures that should be followed to keep a Linux-based server or desktop
system up and running.  It is geared to an audience of both corporate as
well as home users.  It is not intended to be a full overview of Unix
operations, as there are several good texts available as well as on-line
documentation which can be referred to in cases where more detailed
information is required.</P
><P
>In general, your Linux system can operate with a minimum of user
maintenance.  Routine tasks, such as rotating and discarding of system
logs, are automated.  Therefore, for the most part, even with very little
user intervention, Linux will hum along doing its job.  However, in cases
of custom needs or system failure this documentation may prove
useful.</P
><P
>I currently use Linux both at home and at my place of employment.  
It has served me well, and has worked as a reliable Internet and
file/print service for my employer for over four years now.</P
