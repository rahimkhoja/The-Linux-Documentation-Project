>The GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) is a windowing
environment that enhances your X window environment.  It is full-featured,
including a large selection of applications you may find useful.  
However, at the time of this writing, GNOME still has a few minor bugs,
meaning you may have to put up with errant behaviour at times.  However, it
is fairly stable and definitely usable!</P
><P
>If you're using Red Hat 6.1, the latest version of GNOME (at least,
the latest at the time of this writing!) is included with the
distribution.  Otherwise, you will need to download the latest RPM
distribution of the package.  At the time of this writing, the RPM files
for Red Hat 6.0 i386 systems can be found at <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/RHAD/redhat-6.0/i386/"

>ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/RHAD/redhat-6.0/i386/</A

mirror site).</P

>Contrary to popular belief, GNOME is actually
<EM

> a Window manager, but instead sits on top of your
favorite one, providing added functionality to it.  Therefore, once you
have installed GNOME, you should decide which window manager you wish to
use, and create a ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.xinitrc</TT
></TT
>''
file in your directory which loads the appropriate window manager and
starts GNOME.  The file should look something like this:</P

run GNOME on top of it.</P
