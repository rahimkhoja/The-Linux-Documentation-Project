>&#13;      By now you should have organized your document; you collected bits of raw information
      and inserted them into the outline.
      Your next challenge is to massage all of the raw data you've collected 
	  into a readable, entertaining and understandable whole. If you are
	  working from an existing document make sure any new pieces of
	  information are in the best possible places.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      It has taken quite a bit of work to get to the point where you can
      actually start writing, hasn't it? Well, the hard work begins to pay
      off for you now. At this stage, you can begin to really use your
      imagination and creativity to communicate this heap of information. 
		Don't be too clever though! Your readers are already struggling with 
		new concepts--do not make them struggle to understand your language
		as well.
    </P

>&#13;	  There are a number of classic guides to writing--many
	  of which are available on-line. 
	  Their language will
	  seem old, but the messages are still valuable to authors today.
	  These are listed in . Also listed in the
	  resources section are a variety of sites that have 
	  information specific to technical writing.

>&#13;	  The Author Guide wouldn't be complete without
	  mentioning the Plain Language movement. Although
	  directed at simplifying government documents, <A
HREF="http://www.blm.gov/nhp/NPR/pe_toc.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Writing user-friendly
	  documents</A
> is quite useful. It includes before and after

	  a nod toward <A

>4.1.1. Writing Style and Style Guides</H2
><P
>&#13;	  There are a number of industry style guides which define how language
	  should be used in documents. A common example for American English is
	  the <A
HREF="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>Chicago Manual
	  of Style</A
>. It defines things like: whether a period (.) should be inside or
	  outside of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"quotes"</SPAN
>; and the format for citing 
	  another document. A style guide helps to keep documents
	  consistent--most corporations will follow a style guide to 
	  format media releases and other promotional material. 
	  Style guides mays also define how words should be spelled 
	  (is it color or colour?).
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  The LDP does not require a specific style
	  guide; however, you should use a consistent style throughout your
	  document. Your document should be spell checked for a single
	  language (e.g. American English vs. British English).
	  The <A
HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/"
TARGET="_top"
>Reviewer's HOWTO</A
> currently lists a number of
	  conventions for LDP documents and it is as close as it
	  gets to an official LDP Style Guide.

>&#13;	  You can save yourself a lot of time in the editing phase if you
	  decide how you will write your document ahead of time. If you are
	  taking over someone else's document you may need to either: modify
	  your own style to fit the current document; or edit the
	  document so that it melds with the style you would like to
	  use from now on.

>&#13;      From a writing style perspective, use of the
	  first-person in a HOWTO adds to its charm--an attribute most 
	  other documentation sorely lacks. Don't be afraid

CLASS="QUOTE"
