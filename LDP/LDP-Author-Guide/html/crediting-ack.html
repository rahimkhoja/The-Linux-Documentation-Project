>Your document should have an <SPAN

>"Acknowledgments"</SPAN
> section,
      in which you mention everyone who has contributed to your document in
      any meaningful way. You should include translators and converters, as well as
      people who have sent you lots of good feedback, perhaps the person who taught
      you the knowledge you are now passing on, and anybody else who was instrumental
      in making the document what it is. Most authors put this section at the end
      of their document.

>When someone else assists in the production of an
	 LDP document,
    you should give them proper attribution, and there are DocBook tags
    designed to do this. This section will show you the tags you should
    use, as well as other ways of giving credit where credit is due.
    Crediting editors is easy - there is already an
    <TT
CLASS="sgmltag"
>&#60;editor&#62;</TT
>tag in DocBook.
    But there are two special cases where you need to credit someone,
    but DocBook doesn't provide a special tag. These are <EM
>translators</EM
>
    and <EM
>converters</EM
>.</P
><P
>A <EM
>converter</EM
> is someone
    who performs a source code conversion, for instance from HTML to DocBook XML.
    Source code conversions help the LDP achieve long term goals for meta-data,
    and allow us to distribute documentation in many different formats.</P
><P
>Translators take your original document and translate it into other
    human-readable languages, from English to Japanese for example, or from German
    to English. Each translation allows many more people all over the world
    to make use of your document and of the Linux operating system!</P
><P
>&#13;		We recommend that 
		you acknowledge converters in the comment for the
      initial version released in the new format, and 
		we recommend that you credit translators in each 
		version which they have translated.</P
