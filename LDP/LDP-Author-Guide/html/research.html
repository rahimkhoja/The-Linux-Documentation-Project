>&#13;	  While you are working on your outline you will most likely research 
	  your topic--especially to confirm the document you are about to 
	  write does not yet exist! Here are a few pointers that will keep
	  you from pulling out your hair later:
	</P

><UL
><LI
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Compile your resources as you research. </B
>It is almost guaranteed you will not remember where to
			find a critical piece of information when you need it most. It
			will help to bookmark important (and even not so important)
			pages as you go. Make sure the bookmark's title reflects why the
			page is important to you.
			If there are multiple key ideas in one page, you may want to bookmark the
			same page with different titles.</P

><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Assume your most important resource will disappear. </B
>The dreaded <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Error 404: Page not found"</SPAN
>. Even if you have
			bookmarked a page it may not be there when you return to it. If
			a page contains a really critical piece of information: make a
			copy. You may do this by creating a text file with the title of 
			the document, the author's name, the page's URL and the text of 
			the page into a text file on your computer. You might also
			choose to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"print"</SPAN
> the file to a PDF (save as or convert to PDF format will
			capture the original URL on the page if you're using a smart
			browser).</P
></DIV

><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Start your <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Resources"</SPAN
> page now. </B
>As you find pages of interest add them to a Resources
			document. You may do this by exporting your bookmarks or by
			keeping a separate text file with the Resources sorted by
			sub-category. A little effort now will save you a lot of time
			later.</P

><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Write down subject areas as you go. </B
>If you are card sorting you may find it particularly
			useful to write topic cards as you find pages that cover that
			specific topic. At the top of the card write the subject area.
			In the main area of the card write a few notes about what you
			might cover under this topic--include the titles of pages that
			contain important information. If a sub-topic gets too big you
			may want to divide it into multiple cards.</P

><B
>Separate generic information from version-specific
			information. </B
>A new version of the software that you describe might be released the day after you release your document.
			Other things, like where to download
			the software, won't change. Alternatively, you may 
			choose to document old problems with specific software as a way
			of encouraging readers to upgrade to the latest version available:
			<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Version X of the software is known for a specific bug.
			The bug was fixed as of Version Y."</SPAN
>
			</P
></DIV
></LI
><LI
><DIV
CLASS="formalpara"
><P
><B
>Save all related emails. </B
>People will often have interesting insight into the
			problem that you are writing about. Any questions that are asked
			about your topic should be addressed in the final document. If
			you are writing about software make sure to ask people what
			system they are using. Add information in your document about
			which system configurations your instructions have been tested
			on. (Having lots of friends with moderately different
			configurations can be very beneficial!)
			All of these personal experiences can add
			greatly to your final documentation.</P
