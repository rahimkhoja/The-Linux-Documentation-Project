>1.1. A Brief History of GNU/Linux</H1
><P
>In the early 90's GNU/Linux systems consisted of little more than a
    beta-quality Linux kernel and a small collection of software ported from
    the GNU project. It was a true hacker's operating system. There were no
    CD-ROM's or GUI installation tools; everything had to be compiled and
    configured by the end user. Being a Linux Expert meant knowing your system
    inside and out.</P
><P
>Toward the middle of the decade several GNU/Linux distributions
    began appearing. One of the first was <A

>Slackware</A
> in 1993 and since then
    there have been many others. Even though there are many "flavors" of Linux
    today, the main purpose of the distribution remains the same. The
    distribution automates many of the tasks involved in GNU/Linux
    installation and configuration taking the burden off of the system
    administrator. Being a Linux Expert now means knowing which button to
    click in the GUI administration tool.</P
><P
>Recently there has been a yearn for a return to the "good old days"
    of Linux when men were men, sysadmins were hardcore geeks and everything
    was compiled from source code. A notable indication of this movement was
    the publication of the Linux-From-Scratch-HOWTO version 1.0 by Gerard
    Beekmans in 1999. Being a Linux Expert once again means knowing how to do
    it yourself.</P
