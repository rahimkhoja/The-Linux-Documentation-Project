>An operating system by itself is not much fun. What makes an OS
    great is the applications that can be run on top of it. Unfortunately,
    Pocket Linux currently does not have much room for anything other than
    system programs. Still, it would be nice to expand the system just enough
    to host some cool applications. Obviously a full-blown X-Windows GUI is
    out of the question, but running a small console based program should be
    within our reach.</P
><P
>Rather than doing a typical "hello world" program as an example,
    application hosting will be demonstrated using a console based audio
    player called mp3blaster. Building mp3blaster offers more technical
    challenge than "hello world" and the finished product should be a lot more
    fun. However, it should not be construed that a console-based jukebox is
    the only application for Pocket Linux. On the contrary, after completing
    this phase the reader should have the knowledge and tools to build almost
    any console-based program he or she desires.</P
><P
>So what will it take to turn a pocket-sized GNU/Linux system into a
    pocket-sized mp3 player? A few things are listed below.</P
