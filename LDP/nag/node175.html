If you want to use a serial line as a dial-in port, you have to enable
a getty process on this port.  However, some getty
implementations aren't really suitable for this, because you usually
want to use a serial port for dialing in and out.  You therefore have
to make sure to use a getty that is able to share the line with
other programs like uucico, or minicom. One program that
does this is uugetty from the getty_ps package.  Most
 distributions have it; check for uugetty in your
/sbin directory.  Another program I am aware of is Gert
Doering's mgetty, which also supports reception of facsimiles.
You can also obtain the latest versions of these from
sunsite.unc.edu as either binary or source.
<P>
Explaining the differences in the way uugetty and mgetty
handle logins is beyond the scope of this little section; for more
information, please refer to the Serial HOWTO by Grag Hankins, as well
as the documentation that comes along with getty_ps and
mgetty.
