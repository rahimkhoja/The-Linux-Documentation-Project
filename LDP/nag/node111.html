<P>
Before pppd parses its command line arguments, it scans several
files for default options.  These files may contain any valid command
line arguments, spread out across an arbitrary number of lines.
comments are introduced by has signs.
<P>
The first options file is /etc/ppp/options, which is always scanned
when pppd starts up.  Using it to set some global defaults is a good
idea, because it allows you to keep your users from doing several things
that may compromise security.  For instance, to make pppd require
some kind of authentication (either PAP or CHAP) from the peer, you would
add the auth option to this file.  This option cannot be
overridden by the user, so that it becomes impossible to establish a PPP
connection with any system that is not in our authentication databases.
<P>
<A NAME="4543"></A>
The other option file, which is read after /etc/ppp/options, is
.ppprc in the user's home directory. It allows each user to
specify her own set of default options.
<P>
A sample /etc/ppp/options file might look like this:
<Pre>
           # Global options for pppd running on vlager.vbrew.com
           auth                 # require authentication
           usehostname          # use local hostname for CHAP
           lock                 # use UUCP-style device locking
           domain vbrew.com     # our domain name

 
</pre>
<A NAME="4167"></A>
<A NAME="4168"></A>
The first two of these options apply to authentication and will be
explained below.  The lock keyword makes pppd comply
to the standard UUCP method of device locking.  With this convention,
each process that accesses a serial device, say /dev/cua3,
creates a lock file named LCK..cua3 in the UUCP spool directory
to signal that the device is in use. This is necessary to prevent any
other programs such as minicom or uucico to open the
serial device while used by PPP.
<P>
The reason to provide these options in the global configuration file
is that options such as those shown above cannot be overridden, and so
provide for a reasonable level of security. Note however, that some
options can be overridden later; one such an example is the
connect string.
