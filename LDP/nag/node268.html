The most widely known message is cancel, with which a user may
cancel an article sent by her earlier. This effectively removes the
article from the spool directories, if it exists. The cancel
message is forwarded to all sites that receive news from the groups
affected, regardless of whether the article has been seen already or
not. This is to take into account the possibility that the original
article has been delayed over the cancelation message. Some news
systems allow users to cancel other person's messages; this is of course
a definite no-no.
