UUCP's task is to copy files from one system to another, and to request
execution of certain commands on remote hosts. Of course, you as an
administrator would want to control what rights you grant other
systems-- allowing them to execute any command on your system is
definitely not a good idea.

By default, the only commands Taylor UUCP allows other systems to
execute on your machine are rmail and rnews, which are
commonly used to to exchange email and Usent news over UUCP. The default
search path used by uuxqt is a compile-time option, but should
usually contain /bin, /usr/bin, and /usr/local/bin.
To change the set of commands for a particular system, you can use the
commands keyword in the sys file. Similarly, the search
path can be changed with the command-path statement.  For
instance, you may want to allow system pablo to execute the
rsmtp command in addition to rmail and
rnews:<A HREF="footnode.html#6617"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
