Now, of course, sending datagrams from one host to another is not the
whole story. If you log into quark, you want to have a reliable
connection between your rlogin process on erdos and the
shell process on quark. Thus, the information sent to and fro must
be split up into packets by the sender, and reassembled into a character
stream by the receiver. Trivial as it seems, this involves a number of
hairy tasks.
<P>
A very important thing to know about IP is that, by intent, it is not
reliable. Assume that ten people on your Ethernet started downloading the
latest release of XFree86 from GMU's FTP server. The amount of traffic
generated by this might be too much for the gateway to handle, because it's
too slow, and it's tight on memory. Now if you happen to send a packet to
quark, sophus might just be out of buffer space for a moment
and therefore unable to forward it.  IP solves this problem by simply
discarding it. The packet is irrevocably lost.  It is therefore the
responsibility of the communicating hosts to check the integrity and
completeness of the data, and retransmit it in case of an error.
<P>
This is performed by yet another protocol, TCP, or <em>Transmission
Control Protocol</em>, which builds a reliable service on top of IP.  The
essential property of TCP is that it uses IP to give you the illusion
of a simple connection between the two processes on your host and the
remote machine, so that you don't have to care about how and along
which route your data actually travels.  A TCP connection works
essentially like a two-way pipe that both processes may write to and
read from. Think of it as a telephone conversation.
<P>

TCP identifies the end points of such a connection by the
IP-addresses of the two hosts involved, and the number of a
so-called <a href="node15.html">port</a> on each host. Ports may be viewed as
attachment points for network connections. If we are to strain the
telephone example a little more, one might compare IP-addresses
to area codes (numbers map to cities), and port numbers to local
codes (numbers map to individual people's telephones).
<P>
In the rlogin example, the client application (rlogin)
opens a port on erdos, and connects to port 513 on
quark, which the rlogind server is known to listen to.
This establishes a TCP connection. Using this connection,
rlogind performs the authorization procedure, and then spawns
the shell. The shell's standard input and output are redirected to
the TCP connection, so that anything you type to rlogin
on your machine will be passed through the TCP stream and be
given to the shell as standard input.
