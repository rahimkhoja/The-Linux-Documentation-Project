There is no true standard configuration of electronic mail transport and
delivery agents and there is no ``one true directory structure.''
<P>
Accordingly, it is necessary to ensure that all the various pieces of the
system (USENET news, mail, TCP/IP) agree on the location of the local mail
delivery program (lmail, deliver, etc.), remote mail delivery
program (rmail), and the mail transport program (sendmail or
smail). Such assumptions are not generally documented, although use of
the strings command can help determine what files and directories are
expected.  The following are some problems we've seen in the past with some
of the commonly available  binary distributions and sources.
<P>
<UL><LI>
	Some versions of the NET-2 distribution of TCP/IP have services
	defined for a program called umail rather than
	sendmail.<LI>
	There are various ports of elm and mailx that look for
	a delivery agent of /usr/bin/smail rather than sendmail.<LI>
	Sendmail+IDA has a built-in local mailer for deliver, but
	expects it to be located in /bin rather than the more typical
	 location of /usr/bin.
<P>

<P>
Rather than go through the trouble of building all the mail clients from
sources, we generally fake it with the appropriate soft links...
