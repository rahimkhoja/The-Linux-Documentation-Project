Now, that was rather simple. Nevertheless, you might want to automate
the above steps so that you only have to invoke a simple command that
performs all steps shown above. This is what dip is
for.<A HREF="footnode.html#4006"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> The current release as of this writing is version-3.3.7. It has been
patched very heavily by a number of people, so that you can't speak of
<em>the</em> dip program anymore. These different strains of
development will hopefully be merged in a future release.
<P>
dip provides an interpreter for a simple scripting language that
can handle the modem for you, convert the line to SLIP mode, and
configure the interfaces.  This is rather primitive and restrictive, but
sufficient for most cases. A new release of dip may feature a
more versatile language one day.

To be able to configure the SLIP interface, dip requires root
privilege. It would now be tempting to make dip setuid to
root, so that all users can dial up some SLIP server without
having to give them root access. This is very dangerous, because setting
up bogus interfaces and default routes with dip may disrupt
routing on your network badly.  Even worse, this will give your users
the power to connect to <em>any</em> SLIP server, and launch dangerous
attacks on your network. So if you want to allow your users to fire up a
SLIP connection, write small wrapper programs for each prospective SLIP
server, and have these wrappers invoke dip with the specific
script that establishes the connection. These programs can then safely
be made setuid root.<A HREF="footnode.html#4007"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
