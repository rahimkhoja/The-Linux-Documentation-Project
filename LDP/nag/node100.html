The get command is dip's way of setting a variable.
The simplest form is to set a variable to a constant, as used

throughout the above example. You may, however, also prompt the
user for input by specifying the keyword ask instead
of a value:
<P>
<pre>
           DIP> get $local ask
           Enter the value for $local: 
</pre>
<P>
A third method is to try to obtain the value from the remote host.
Bizarre as it seems first, this is very useful in some cases:
Some SLIP servers will not allow you to use your own IP-address on the
SLIP link, but will rather assign you one from a pool of addresses
whenever you dial in, printing some message that informs you about
the address you have been assigned. If the message looks something
like this ``Your address: 193.174.7.202'', then the following
piece of dip code would let you pick up the address:
<P>
<pre> 
	wait address: 10
	get $locip remote
</pre>
