Taylor UUCP also allows you to fine-tune file transfers in great
detail.  At one extreme, you can disable transfers to and from a
particular system.  Just set request to no, and
the remote system will not be able either to retrieve files from your
system or send it any files.  Similarly, you can prohibit your users
from transferring files to or from a system by setting
transfer to no.  By default, users on both the
local and the remote system are allowed to up- and download files.
<P>
In addition, you can configure the directories to and from which files may
be copied. Usually, you will want to restrict access from remote systems
to a single directory hierarchy, but still allow your users to send
files from their home directory. Commonly, remote users will be allowed
to receive files only from the public UUCP directory, /var/spool/uucppublic.
This is the traditional place to make files publicly available; very
much like FTP servers on the Internet.  It is commonly referred to using
the tilde character.
<P>
Therefore, Taylor UUCP provides four different commands to configure the
directories for sending and receiving files. They are
local-send, which specifies the list of directories a user may
ask UUCP to send files from; local-receive, which gives the
the list of directories a user may ask to receive files to; and
remote-send and remote-receive, which do the
analogous for requests from a foreign system.
Consider the following example:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
The local-send command allows users on your host to send any
files below /home and from the public UUCP directory to
pablo. The local-receive command allows them to
receive files either to the world-writable receive directory in
the uucppublic, or any world-writable directory below /home.  The
remote-send directive allows pablo to request files
from /var/spool/uucppublic, except for files below the incoming and
receive directories. This is signaled to uucico by
preceding the directory names with exclamation marks. Finally, the
last line allows pablo to upload any files to incoming.
<P>
One of the biggest problems with file transfers using UUCP is that
will only receive files to directories that are world-writable.
This may tempt some users to set up traps for other users, etc.
However, there's no way escaping this problem except disabling UUCP
file transfers altogether.
