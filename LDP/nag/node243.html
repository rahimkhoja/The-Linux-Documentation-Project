<P>
To build a sendmail.cf file customized for your site, you have to
write a sendmail.m4 file, and process it with m4.
In /usr/local/lib/mail/CF, you find a sample file called
sample.m4.  Copy it to yourhostname.m4, and edit
it to reflect the situation of your site.
<P>
The sample file is set up for a UUCP-only site that has domainized
headers and talks to a smart host.  Sites like this only need to edit
a few items.
<P>
In the current section, I will only give a short overview of the
macros you have to change. For a complete description of what they do,
please refer to the earlier discussion of the sendmail.m4.

<P>
To create the sendmail.cf file, execute the command
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
This processes the yourhostname.m4 file and creates
yourhostname.cf from it.
<P>
Next, you should test whether the configuration file you've created
does what you expect it to do.  This is explained in the following two
sections.
<P>
Once you're happy with its behavior, copy it into place with the
command:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
<A NAME="8450"></A>
<A NAME="8451"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="8452"></A>
<A NAME="8453"></A>
At this point, your sendmail system is ready for action.  Put the following
line in the appropriate startup file (generally /etc/rc.inet2).  You
can also execute it by hand to have the process start up now.
