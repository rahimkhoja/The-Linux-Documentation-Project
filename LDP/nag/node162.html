The port and speed options are used to select
the device used for calling the remote system, and the maximum
speed to which the device should be set.<A HREF="footnode.html#6030"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> A system entry may use either option alone, or both options
in conjunction.  When looking up a suitable device in the port
file, only those ports are selected that have a matching port name
and/or speed range.
<P>
Generally, using the speed option should suffice. If you have
only one serial device defined in port, uucico will always
pick the right one, anyway, so you only have to give it the desired
speed.  If you have several modems attached to your systems, you still
often don't want to name a particular port, because if uucico
finds that there are several matches, it tries each device in turn until
it finds an unused one.
