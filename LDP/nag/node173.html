UUCP provides a mechanism to have other systems execute file transfers
on your behalf.  For instance, this allows you to make seci
retrieve a file from uchile for you, and send it to your
system.  The following command would achieve this:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
This technique of passing a job through several systems is called
<em>forwarding</em>.   In the above example, the reason to use forwarding
may be that seci has UUCP access to uchile, but your
host doesn't.  However, if you run a UUCP system, you would want to
limit the forwarding service to a few hosts you trust not to run up
a horrendous phone bill by making you download the latest X11R6 source
release for them.
<P>
By default, Taylor UUCP disallows forwarding altogether. To enable
forwarding for a particular system, you can use the forward
command.  This command specifies a list of sites the system may
request you to forward jobs to and from. For instance, the UUCP
administrator of seci would have to add the following lines to
the sys file to allow pablo to request files from
uchile:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
The forward-to entry for uchile is necessary so that
any files returned by it are actually passed on to pablo.
Otherwise UUCP would drop them. This entry uses a variation of the
forward command that permits uchile only to send
files to pablo through seci; not the other way round.
<P>
To permit forwarding to any system, use the special keyword ANY
(capital letters required).
