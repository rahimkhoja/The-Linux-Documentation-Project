If you are running a site with two or more hosts connected by a LAN, you
will have to designate one host that handles your UUCP connection with
the outside world. Between the hosts on your LAN, you will most probably
want to exchange mail with SMTP over TCP/IP.  Assume we're back at the
Virtual Brewery again, and vstout is set up as the UUCP gateway.

In a networked environment, it is best to keep all user mailboxes on a
single file system, which is NFS-mounted on all other hosts. This allows
users to move from machine to machine, without having to move their mail
around (or even worse, check some three or four machines for
newly-arrived mail each morning). Therefore, you also want to make
sender addresses independent from the machine the mail was written on.
It is common practice to use the domain name all by itself in the sender
address, instead of a hostname.  Janet User, for example, would specify
janet@vbrew.com instead of janet@vale.vbrew.com.  We
will explain below how to make the server recognize the domain name as a
valid name for your site.

A different way of keeping all mailboxes on a central host is to use
POP or IMAP.  POP stands for <em>Post Office Protocol</em> and lets
users access their mailboxes over a simple TCP/IP connection.  IMAP,
the <em>Interactive Mail Access Protocol</em>, is similar to POP, but
more general. Both clients and servers for IMAP and POP have been
ported to , and are available from sunsite.unc.edu below
/pub/Linux/system/Network.
