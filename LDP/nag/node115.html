In the example above, we had pppd dial up c3po and establish
an IP link.  No provisions were taken to choose a particular IP-address on
either end of the link.  Instead, we picked vlager's address as the
local IP-address, and let c3po provide its own.  Sometimes, however,
it is useful to have control over what address is used on one or the other
end of the link.  pppd supports several variations of this.
<P>
To ask for particular addresses, you generally provide pppd with
the following option:
<Pre>
           local addr:remote addr


</Pre>
where local_addr and remote_addr may be specified
either in dotted quad notation, or as hostnames.<A HREF="footnode.html#4282"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> This makes pppd attempt to use the first address as its own
IP-address, and the second as the peer's. If the peer rejects either of
them during IPCP negotiation, no IP-link will be established.<A HREF="footnode.html#4549"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
If you want to set only the local address, but accept any address the
peer uses, you simply leave out the remote_addr part. For
instance, to make vlager use the IP-address 130.83.4.27
instead of its own, you would give it 130.83.4.27: on the
command line.  Similarly, to set the remote address only, you would
leave the local_addr field blank. By default, pppd
will then use the address associated with your hostname.

Some PPP servers that handle a lot of client sites assign addresses
dynamically: addresses are assigned to systems only when calling in, and
are claimed after they have logged off again. When dialing up such a
server, you must make sure that pppd doesn't request any particular
IP-address from the server, but rather accept the address the server asks
you to use. This means that you mustn't specify a local_addr
argument. In addition, you have to use the noipdefault option,
which makes pppd wait for the peer to provide the IP-address instead
of using the local host's address.
