The current  network code supports various brands of Ethernet
cards. Most drivers were written by Donald Becker
(becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov), who authored a family of
drivers for cards based on the National Semiconductor-8390 chip; these
have become known as the Becker Series Drivers.  There are also
drivers for a couple of products from D-Link, among them the D-Link
pocket adaptor that allows you to access an Ethernet through a
parallel port. The driver for this was written by Bj&#248;rn Ekwall
(bj0rn@blox.se). The DEPCA driver was written by David
C.-Davies (davies@wanton.lkg.dec.com).
