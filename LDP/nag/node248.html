Frequently, Internet hosts will have trouble getting mail into misconfigured
remote sites.  There are several variants of this problem, but the general
symptom is that mail is bounced by the remote system or never gets there at
all.
<P>
These problems can put the local system administrator in a bad position
because your users generally don't care that you don't personally administer
every system worldwide (or know how to get the remote administrator to fix
the problem).  They just know that their mail didn't get through to the
desired recipient on the other end and that you're a likely person to complain
to.
<P>
A remote site's configuration is their problem, not yours.  In all cases, be
certain to <em>not</em> break your site in order to communicate with a
misconfigured remote site. If you can't get in touch with the Postmaster at
the remote site to get them to fix their configuration in a timely manner,
you have two options.
<P>

	It is generally possible to force mail into the remote system
	successfully, although since the remote system is misconfigured,
	replies on the remote end might not work...but then that's the
	remote administrator's problem.
<P>
	You can fix the bad headers in the envelope on your outgoing messages
	only by using a domaintable entry for their host/domain that
	results in the invalid information being corrected in mail
	originating from your site:
<P>
	<P><P><LI>
	Frequently, misconfigured sites `bounce' mail back to the sending
	system and effectively say ``that mail isn't for this site'' because
	they do not have their PSEUDONYMNS or equivalent set
	properly in their configuration.  It is possible to totally strip off
	all hostname and domain information from the envelope of messages
	going from your site to them.
<P>
	The ! in the following mailertable delivers mail to
	their remote site making it appear to their sendmail as if it
	had originated locally on their system.  Note that this changes only
	the envelope address, so the proper return address will still show up
	in the message.
<P>

Regardless, even if you get mail into their system, there is no guarantee that
they can reply to your message (they're broken, remember...) but then their
users are yelling at their administrators rather than your users yelling at
you.
