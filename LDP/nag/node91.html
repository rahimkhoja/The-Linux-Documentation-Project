There are a few tools that can help you with your tasks as a BIND
administrator. I will briefly describe two of them here.
Please refer to the documentation that comes with these tools for
information on how to use them.

hostcvt is a tool that helps you with your initial
BIND configuration by converting your /etc/hosts file
into master files for named. It generates both the forward
(A) and reverse mapping (PTR) entries, and takes care of aliases
and the like. Of course, it won't do the whole job for you, as you may
still want to tune the timeout values in the SOA record, for instance,
or add MX records and the like. Still, it may help you save a few
aspirins. hostcvt is part of the BIND source, but can also
be found as a standalone package on a few  FTP servers.

After setting up your name server, you may want to test your
configuration.  The ideal (and, to my knowledge) only tool for
this is dnswalk, a perl-based package that 
walks your DNS database, looking for common mistakes and
verifying that the information is consistent. dnswalk
has been released on comp.sources.misc recently, and
should be available on all FTP sites that archive this group
(ftp.uu.net should be a safe bet if you don't know
of any such site near you).
