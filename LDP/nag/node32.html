Dynamic routing based on RIP chooses the best route to some destination
host or network based on the number of ``hops'', that is, the gateways a
datagram has to pass before reaching it. The shorter a route is, the
better RIP rates it. Very long routes with 16 or more hops are regarded
as unusable, and are discarded.
<P>
To use RIP to manage routing information internal to your local
network, you have to run gated on all hosts. At boot time,
gated checks for all active network interfaces.  If there is
more than one active interface (not counting the loopback interface),
it assumes the host is switching packets between several networks, and
will actively exchange and broadcast routing information. Otherwise,
it will only passively receive any RIP updates and update the local
routing table.
<P>
When broadcasting the information from the local routing table,
gated computes the length of the route from the so-called
<em>metric value</em> associated with the routing table entry. This
metric value is set by the system administrator when configuring the
route and should reflect the actual cost of using this route. Therefore,
the metric of a route to a subnet the host is directly connected to
should always be zero, while a route going through two gateways should
have a metric of two. However, note that you don't have to bother about
metrics when you don't use RIP or gated.
