The program that provides domain name service on most  machines is
usually called named (pronounced <em>name-dee</em>). This is a
server program originally developed for BSD providing name service to
clients, and possibly to other name servers. The version currently 
used on most  installations seems to be BIND-4.8.3. The new
version, BIND-4.9.3, is being Beta-tested at the moment, and should be
available on  soon.
<P>
This section requires some understanding of the way the Domain Name
System works. If the following discussion is all Greek to you, you may
want to re-read chapter-<A HREF="node23.html#tcpip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, which has some more information
on the basics of DNS.

named is usually started at system boot time, and runs until
the machine goes down again.  It takes its information from a
configuration file called /etc/named.boot, and various files
that contain data mapping domain names to addresses and the like. The
latter are called <em>zone files</em>.  The formats and semantics of
these files will be explained in the following section.
<P>
To run named, simply enter
<pre>
           # /usr/sbin/named
</pre>
at the prompt. named will come up, read the named.boot
file and any zone files specified therein. It writes its process id to
/var/run/named.pid in ASCII, downloads any zone files from primary
servers, if necessary, and starts listening on port 53 for DNS
queries.<A HREF="footnode.html#3689"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
