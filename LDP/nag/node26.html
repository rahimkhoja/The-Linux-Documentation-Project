Now that you've seen how IP-addresses are made up, you may be wondering
how they are used on an Ethernet to address different hosts. After all,
the Ethernet protocol identifies hosts by a six-octet number that has
absolutely nothing in common with an IP-address, doesn't it?
<P>
<A NAME="858"></A>
Right. That's why a mechanism is needed to map IP-addresses onto
Ethernet addresses. This is the so-called <em>Address Resolution
Protocol</em>, or ARP. In fact, ARP is not confined to Ethernets at all,
but is used on other types networks such as ham radio as well.  The
idea underlying ARP is exactly what most people do when they have to
find Mr. X. Ample in a throng of 150-people: they go round, calling
out his name, confident that he will respond if he's there.
<P>
When ARP wants to find out the Ethernet address corresponding to a
given IP-address, it uses a feature of Ethernet known as
``broadcasting,'' where a datagram is addressed to all stations on the
network simultaneously. The broadcast datagram sent by ARP contains a
query for the IP-address. Each receiving host compares this to its own
IP-address, and if it matches, returns an ARP reply to the inquiring
host. The inquiring host can now extract the sender's Ethernet address
from the reply.
<P>
Of course you might wonder how a host may know on which of the
zillions of Ethernets throughout the world it is to find the desired
host, and why this should even be an Ethernet. These questions all
involve what is called routing, namely finding out the physical
location of a host in a network.  This will be the topic of the
following section.
<P>
For a moment, let's talk about ARP a little longer. Once a host has
discovered an Ethernet address, it stores it in its ARP cache,
so that it doesn't have to query for it the next time it wants to
send a datagram to the host in question. However, it is unwise to
keep this information forever; for instance, the remote host's
Ethernet card may be replaced because of technical problems, so the 
ARP entry becomes invalid. To force another query for the IP-address,
entries in the ARP cache are therefore discarded after some time.

Sometimes, it is also necessary to find out the IP-address associated
with a given Ethernet address. This happens when a diskless machine
wants to boot from a server on the network, which is quite a common
situation on local area networks. A diskless client, however, has
virtually no information about itself-- except for its Ethernet
address! So what it basically does is broadcast a message containing a
plea for boot servers to tell it its IP-address. There's another
protocol for this, named <em>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol</em>, or
RARP. Along with the BOOTP protocol, it serves to define a procedure
for bootstrapping diskless clients over the network.
