DNS organizes host names in a hierarchy of domains.  A domain is a
collection of sites that are related in some sense--- be it because
they form a proper network (e.g. all machines on a campus, or all hosts
on BITNET), because they all belong to a certain organization (like the
U.S. government), or because they're simply geographically close. For
instance, universities are grouped in the edu domain, with each
University or College using a separate <em>subdomain</em> below which
their hosts are subsumed. Groucho Marx University might be given the
groucho.edu domain, with the LAN of the Mathematics Department
being assigned maths.groucho.edu.  Hosts on the departmental
network would have this domain name tacked onto their host name; so
erdos would be known as erdos.maths.groucho.edu.  This is
called the <em>fully qualified domain name</em>, or FQDN, which uniquely
identifies this host world-wide.

Figure-<A HREF="node36.html#introfigdns"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows a section of the name space.  The entry
at the root of this tree, which is denoted by a single dot, is quite
appropriately called the <em>root domain</em>, and encompasses all other
domains. To indicate that a host name is a fully qualified domain name,
rather than a name relative to some (implicit) local domain, it is
sometimes written with a trailing dot. This signifies that the name's
last component is the root domain.

Depending on its location in the name hierarchy, a domain may be
called top-level, second-level, or third-level. More levels of
subdivision occur, but are rare. These are a couple of top-level
domains you may see frequently:
<pre>


            edu (Mostly US) educational institutions like universities, etc.


            com Commercial organizations, companies.


            org Non-commercial organizations. Often private UUCP networks  are
                in this domain.


            net Gateways and other administrative host on a network.


            mil US military institutions.


            gov US government institutions.


           uucp Officially, all site names formerly used as UUCP names without
                domain, have been moved to this domain.


</pre>

Technically, the first four of these belong to the US part of the
Internet, but you may also see non-US sites in these domains. This is
especially true of the net domain.  However, mil
and gov are used exclusively in the US.
<P>
Outside the US, each country generally uses a top-level domain of its
own named after the two-letter country code defined in ISO-3166.
Finland, for instance, uses the fi domain, fr is used by
France, de by Germany, or au by Australia etc.  Below
this top-level domain, each country's NIC is free to organize host
names in whatever way they want. Australia, for example, has
second-level domain similar to the international top-level domains,
named com.au, edu.au, and so on.  Others, like Germany,
don't use this extra level, but rather have slightly longish names that
refer directly to the organizations running a particular domain. For
example, it's not uncommon to see host names like
ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de. Chalk that up to German
efficiency.
<P>
Of course, these national domains do not imply that a host below that
domain is actually located in that country; it only signals that the
host has been registered with that country's NIC. A Swedish manufacturer
might have a branch in Australia, and still have all its hosts
registered with the se top-level domain.
<P>
Now, organizing the name space in a hierarchy of domain names nicely
solves the problem of name uniqueness; with DNS, a host name has to be
unique only within its domain to give it a name different from all
other hosts world-wide. Furthermore, fully qualified names are quite
easy to remember.  Taken by themselves, these are already very good
reasons to split up a large domain into several subdomains.
<P>
<A NAME="1551"></A>
<A NAME="1552"></A>
<A NAME="1553"></A>
But DNS does even more for you than than this: it allows you to delegate
authority over a subdomain to its administrators.  For example, the
maintainers at the Groucho Computing Center might create a subdomain for
each department; we already encountered the maths and
physics subdomains above.  When they find the network at the
Physics Department too large and chaotic to manage from outside (after
all, physicists are known to be an unruly bunch of people), they may
simply pass control over the physics.groucho.edu domain to the
administrators of this network.  These are then free to use whatever
host names they like, and assign them IP addresses from their network in
whatever fashion the like, without outside interference.
<P>
<A NAME="1557"></A>
<A NAME="1746"></A>
To this end, the name space is split up into <em>zones</em>, each rooted
at a domain. Note the subtle difference between a zone and a domain:
the <em>domain</em> groucho.edu encompasses all hosts at the
Groucho Marx University, while the <em>zone</em> groucho.edu
includes only the hosts that are managed by the Computing Center
directly, for example those at the Mathematics Department.  The hosts
at the Physics Department belong to a different zone, namely
physics.groucho.edu.  In figure-<A HREF="node36.html#introfigdns"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, the start
of a zone is marked by a small circle to the right of the domain name.
