Recently, there have been proposals to amend the RFC-822 standard to
support various types of messages, such as plain text, binary data,
Postscript files, etc. The set of standards and RFCs covering these
aspects are commonly referred to as MIME, or Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions.  Among other things, this also lets the recipient know if a
character set other than standard ASCII has been used when writing the
message, for example using French accents, or German umlauts.  This is
supported by elm to some extent.
<P>
The character set used by  internally to represent characters is
usually referred to as ISO-8859-1, which is the name of the standard it
conforms to. It is also known as Latin-1.  Any message using characters
from this character set should have the following line in its header:
<PRE>
           Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
</PRE>
The receiving system should recognize this field and take appropriate
measures when displaying the message. The default for
text/plain messages is a charset value of
us-ascii.
<P>
To be able to display messages with character sets other than ASCII,
elm must know how to print these characters. By default, when
elm receives a message with a charset field other than
us-ascii (or a content type other than text/plain,
for that matter), it tries to display the message using a command called
metamail. Messages that require metamail to be displayed
are shown with an `M' in the very first column in the overview
screen.
<P>
Since ' native character set is ISO-8859-1, calling
metamail is not necessary to display messages using this
character set. If elm is told that the display understands
ISO-8859-1, it will not use metamail but will display the message
directly instead. This can be done by setting the following option in
the global elm.rc:
<PRE>
           displaycharset = iso-8859-1
</PRE>
Note that you should set this options even when you are never going to
send or receive any messages that actually contain characters other than
ASCII. This is because people who do send such messages usually
configure their mailer to put the proper Content-Type: field into
the mail header by default, whether or not they are sending ASCII-only
messages.
<P>
However, setting this option in elm.rc is not enough.  The
problem is that when displaying the message with its built-in pager,
elm calls a library function for each character to determine
whether it is printable or not. By default, this function will only
recognize ASCII characters as printable, and display all other
characters as ``?''.  You may overcome this by setting the
environment variable LC_CTYPE to ISO-8859-1, which
tells the library to accept Latin-1 characters as printable. Support for
this and other features is available since libc-4.5.8.
<P>
When sending messages that contain special characters from ISO-8859-1,
you should make sure to set two more variables in the elm.rc
file:
<PRE>
           charset = iso-8859-1
           textencoding = 8bit
</PRE>
This makes elm report the character set as ISO-8859-1 in the mail
header, and send it as an 8 bit value (the default is to strip all
characters to 7 bit).
<P>
Of course, any of these options can also be set in the private
elmrc file instead of the global one.
