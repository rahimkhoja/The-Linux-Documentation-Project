The central file that controls your resolver setup is host.conf.
It resides in /etc and tells the resolver which services
to use, and in what order.
<P>
Options in host.conf must occur on separate lines. Fields may be
separated by white space (spaces or tabs). A hash sign (#)
introduces a comment that extends to the next newline.
<P>
The following options are available:
<dl>
<dt><b>          order </b><dd> This determines the order in which the resolving services are tried. Valid options are :
<ul><li><b>bind</b> for querying  the  name  server
                <li><b>hosts</b> for lookups in /etc/hosts
		<li><b>nis</b> for NIS lookups.  
	</ul>
<dd>	Any or all of them may be  specified.  The  order  in  which  they
                appear on the line determines the order in which the respective
                services are tried.
<dt><b>multi</b><dd> Takes on or off as  options.  This  determines  if  a  host  in
                /etc/hosts  is  allowed to have several IP addresses, which is
                usually referred to as being ``multi-homed''. This flag has no
                effect on DNS or NIS queries.


<dt><b>        nospoof</b><dd>   As explained in the previous chapter, DNS allows you to find
                the hostname belonging to an  IP  address  by  using  the  in-
                addr.arpa  domain.  Attempts by name servers to supply a false
                hostname are called ``spoofing''. To guard against  this,  the
                resolver may be configured to check if the original IP address
                is in fact associated with the hostname obtained. If not,  the
                name  is  rejected  and  an  error  returned. This behavior is
                turned on by setting nospoof on.


<dt><b>          alert </b><dd>This option takes on or off as arguments.  If it is turned on,
                any  spoof attempts (see above) will cause the resolver to log
                a message to the syslog facility.


<dt><b>           trim</b><dd> This option takes a domain name as an argument, which will  be
                removed from hostnames before lookup. This is useful for hosts
                entries, where you might only want to specify hostnames  with-
                out  local  domain.   A lookup of a host with the local domain
                name appended will have this removed, thus allowing the lookup
                in /etc/hosts to succeed.


              	trim  options  accumulate, making it possible to consider
                your host as being local to several domains.

A sample file for vlager is shown below:
<pre>
           # /etc/host.conf
           # We have named running, but no NIS (yet)
           order   bind hosts
           # Allow multiple addrs
           multi   on
           # Guard against spoof attempts
           nospoof on
           # Trim local domain (not really necessary).
           trim    vbrew.com.
