When capitalizing the access tokens like xfer or
read in the nntp_acces file, nntpd requires the
authorization from the client for the respective operations. For
instance, when specifying a permission of Xfer or
XFER, nntpd will not let the client transfer articles
to your site unless it passes authorization.
<P>
The authorization procedure is implemented by means of a new NNTP
command named AUTHINFO. Using this command, the client
transmits a user name and a password to the NNTP server.  nntpd
will validate them by checking them against the /etc/passwd
database, and verify that the user belongs to the nntp group.
<P>
The current implementation of NNTP authorization is only experimental,
and has therefore not been implemented very portably.  The result of
this is that it works only with plain-style password databases; shadow
passwords will not be recognized.
