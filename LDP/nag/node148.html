<P>
Those who don't find everything they need in this chapter should read
the documentation that comes along with the package.  This is a set of
texinfo files that describe the setup using the Taylor configuration
scheme.  Texinfo can be converted to DVI and to GNU info files using
tex and makeinfo, respectively.

If you want to use BNU or even (shudder!) Version-2 configuration files, 
there is a very good book, ``Managing UUCP and Usenet''
([<A HREF="#reillyuucp"></A>]).  I find it very useful. Another good source for
information about UUCP on Linux is Vince Skahan's UUCP-HOWTO, which is
posted regularly to comp.os.linux.announce.
<P>
There's also a newsgroup for the discussion of UUCP, called
comp.mail.uucp.  If you have questions specific to Taylor UUCP,
you may be better off asking them there, rather than on the
comp.os.linux groups.
