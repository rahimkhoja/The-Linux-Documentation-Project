To use SLIP or PPP, you have to configure some basic networking features
as described in the previous chapters, of course. At the least, you have
to set up the loopback interface, and provide for name resolution. When
connecting to the Internet, you will of course want to use DNS.  The
simplest option is to put the address of some name server into your
resolv.conf file; this server will be queried as soon as the SLIP
link is activated. The closer this name server is to the point where you
dial in, the better.
<P>
However, this solution is not optimal, because all name lookups will
still go through your SLIP/PPP link. If you worry about the bandwidth this
consumes, you can also set up a <em>caching-only</em> name server.  It
doesn't really serve a domain, but only acts as a relay for all DNS
queries produced on your host. The advantage of this scheme is that it
builds up a cache, so that most queries have to be sent over the serial
line only once. A named.boot file for a caching-only server looks
like this:
<pre>
           ; named.boot file for caching-only server
           directory                            /var/named

           primary       0.0.127.in-addr.arpa   db.127.0.0 ; loopback net
           cache         .                      db.cache   ; root servers
</pre>
In addition to this name.boot file, you also have to set up
the db.cache file with a valid list of root name servers.
This is described toward the end of the Resolver Configuration
chapter.
