<P>
All protocols allow for some variation in packet sizes, timeouts, and
the like.  Usually, the defaults provided work well under standard
circumstances, but may not be optimal for your situation.  The <em>g</em>
protocol, for instance, uses window sizes from 1 to 7, and packet sizes
in powers of 2 ranging from 64 through 4096.<A HREF="footnode.html#6627"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>  If your telephone line is usually so noisy that it drops more than
5 percent all packets, you should probably lower the packet size and
shrink the window.  On the other hand, on very good telephone lines
the protocol overhead of sending ACKs for every 128 bytes may prove
wasteful, so that you might increase the packet size to 512 or even
1024.
<P>
Taylor UUCP provides a mechanism to suit your needs by tuning these
parameters with the protocol-parameter command in the
sys file.  For instance, to set the <em>g</em>-protocol's packet
size to 512 when talking to pablo, you have to add:

The tunable parameters and their names vary from protocol to protocol.
For a complete list of them please refer to the documentation enclosed
in the Taylor UUCP source.
