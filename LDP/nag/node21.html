Another very important aspect of system administration in a network
environment is protecting your system and users from intruders.
Carelessly managed systems offer malicious people many targets:  attacks
range from password guessing to Ethernet snooping, and the damage caused
may range from faked mail messages to data loss or violation of your
users' privacy. We will mention some particular problems when discussing
the context they may occur in, and some common defenses against them.
<P>
This section will discuss a few examples and basic techniques in dealing
with system security.  Of course, the topics covered can not treat all
security issues you may be faced with exhaustively; they merely serve to
illustrate the problems that may arise.  Therefore, reading a good book
on security is an absolute must, especially in a networked system.
Simon Garfinkel's ``Practical UNIX Security'' (see [<A HREF="#security"></A>]) is
highly recommendable.
<P>
System security starts with good system administration. This includes
checking the ownership and permissions of all vital files and directories,
monitoring use of privileged accounts, etc. The COPS program, for instance,
will check your file system and common configuration files for unusual
permissions or other anomalies. It is also wise to use a password suite
that enforces certain rules on the users' passwords that make them hard to
guess. The shadow password suite, for instance, requires a password to have
at least five letters, and contain both upper and lower case numbers and
digits.

When making a service accessible to the network, make sure to give it
``least privilege,'' meaning that you don't permit it to do things that
aren't required for it to work as designed. For example, you should make
programs setuid to root or some other privileged account only
when they really need this. Also, if you want to use a service for only
a very limited application, don't hesitate to configure it as
restrictively as your special application allows. For instance, if you
want to allow diskless hosts to boot from your machine, you must provide
the TFTP (trivial file transfer service) so that they can download basic
configuration files from the /boot directory. However, when used
unrestricted, TFTP allows any user anywhere in the world to download any
world-readable file from your system. If this is not what you want,
why not restrict TFTP service to the /boot directory?<A HREF="footnode.html#747"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="675"></A>
Along the same line of thought, you might want to restrict certain
services to users from certain hosts, say from your local network. 
In chapter-<A HREF="node124.html#appl"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, we introduce tcpd which does this for
a variety of network applications.
<P>
Another important point is to avoid ``dangerous'' software. Of course,
any software you use can be dangerous, because software may have bugs
that clever people might exploit to gain access to your system. Things
like these happen, and there's no complete protection against this.
This problem affects free software and commercial products
alike.<A HREF="footnode.html#748"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> However, programs that require special privilege are inherently more
dangerous than others, because any loophole can have drastic
consequences.<A HREF="footnode.html#749"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> If you install a setuid program for network purposes be doubly careful
that you don't miss anything from the documentation, so that you don't
create a security breach by accident.
<P>
<A NAME="750"></A>
You can never rule out that your precautions might fail, regardless how
careful you have been. You should therefore make sure you detect
intruders early. Checking the system log files is a good starting point,
but the intruder is probably as clever, and will delete any obvious
traces he or she left. However, there are tools like
tripwire<A HREF="footnode.html#684"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> that allow you to check vital system files to see if their contents or
permissions have been changed.  tripwire computes various strong
checksums over these files and stores them in a database.  During
subsequent runs, the checksums are re-computed and compared to the stored
ones to detect any modifications.
