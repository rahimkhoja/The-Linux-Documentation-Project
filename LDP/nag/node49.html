A complete list of supported boards is available in
the Ethernet HOWTOs posted monthly to comp.os.linux.announce
by Paul Gortmaker.<A HREF="footnode.html#2215"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
Here's a list of the more widely-known boards supported by Linux. The
actual list in the HOWTO is about three times longer. However, even if
you find your board in this list, check the HOWTO first; there are
sometimes important details about operating these cards. A case in point
is the case of some DMA-based Ethernet boards that use the same DMA
channel as the Adaptec 1542 SCSI controller by default. Unless you move
either of them to a different DMA channel, you will wind up with the 
Ethernet board writing packet data to arbitrary locations on your hard
disk.

      3Com EtherLink Both 3c503 and 3c503/16 are supported, as are  3c507  and
                3c509.   The  3c501  is  supported, too, but is too slow to be
                worth buying.


      Novell Eagle NE1000 and NE2000, and a  variety  of  clones.  NE1500  and
                NE2100 are supported, too.


      Western Digital/SMC WD8003  and  WD8013 (same as SMC Elite and SMC Elite
                Plus) are supported, and also the newer SMC Elite 16 Ultra.


      Hewlett Packard HP 27252, HP 27247B, and HP J2405A.
      D-Link DE-600 pocket adaptor, DE-100, DE-200, and DE-220-T.   There's
                also a patch kit for the DE-650-T, which is a PCMCIA card.(4)


      DEC DE200 (32K/64K), DE202, DE100, and DEPCA rev E.


      Allied Teliesis AT1500 and AT1700.

To use one of these cards with , you may use a pre-compiled
kernel from one of the major  distributions. These generally
have drivers for all of them built in. In the long term, 
however, it's better to roll your own kernel and compile in only those
drivers you actually need.
