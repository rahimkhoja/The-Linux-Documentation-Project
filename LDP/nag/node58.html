In this chapter, we will go through all the steps necessary to setting
up TCP/IP networking on your machine. Starting with the assignment of
IP-addresses, we will slowly work our way through the configuration of
TCP/IP network interfaces, and introduce a few tools that come quite
handy when hunting down problems with your network installation.

<P>
Most of the tasks covered in this chapter you will generally have to
do only once. Afterwards, you have to touch most configuration files
only when adding a new system to your network, or when you reconfigure
your system entirely. Some of the commands used to configure TCP/IP,
however, have to be executed each time the system is booted. This is
usually done by invoking them from the system /etc/rc scripts.
<P>
Commonly, the network-specific part of this procedure is contained
in a script called rc.net or rc.inet. Sometimes, you will
also see two scripts named rc.inet1 and rc.inet2, where the
former initializes the kernel part of networking, while the latter
starts basic networking services and applications. Throughout
the following, I will adhere to the latter concept.
<P>
Below, I will discuss the actions performed by rc.inet1, while
applications will be covered in later chapters. After finishing this
chapter, you should have established a sequence of commands that
properly configure TCP/IP networking on your computer. You should then
replace any sample commands in rc.inet1 with your commands, make
sure rc.inet1 is executed at startup time, and reboot your
machine.  The networking rc scripts that come along with your
favorite  distribution should give you a good example.
