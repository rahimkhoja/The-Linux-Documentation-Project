Sometimes it is desirable to have multiple entries for a single system,
for instance if the system can be reached on different modem lines.
With Taylor UUCP, you can do this by defining a so-called <em>alternate</em>.
<P>
An alternate entry retains all settings from the main system entry, and
and specifies only those values that should be overridden in the default
system entry, or added to it.  An alternate is offset from the system
entry by a line containing the keyword alternate.
<P>
To use two phone numbers for pablo, you would modify its
sys entry in the following way:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
When calling pablo, uucico will now first dial 123-456,
and if this fails, try the alternate.  The alternate entry retains all
settings from the main system entry, and overrides only the telephone
number.
