<P>
The echo command serves as a debugging aid, in that using
echo on makes dip echo to the console everything sends
to the serial device. This can be turned off again by calling
echo off.
<P>
dip also allows you to leave script mode temporarily and
enter terminal mode. In this mode, you can use dip just
like any ordinary terminal program, writing to the serial line
and reading from it. To leave this mode, enter Ctrl-].
