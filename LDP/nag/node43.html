<P>
Most  distributions come along with boot disks that
work for all common types of PC hardware.  This means that the kernel
on those disks has all sorts of drivers configured in that you will
never need, but which waste precious system memory because parts
of the kernel cannot be swapped out. Therefore, you will generally
roll your own kernel, including only those drivers you actually need or
want.
<P>
When running a  system, you should be familiar with building a
kernel. The basics of this are explained in Matt Welsh's ``Installation and
Getting Started'' Guide, which is also part of the  Documentation
Project's series.  In this section, we will therefore discuss only those
configuration options that affect networking.
<P>
When running make config, you will first be asked general
configurations, for instance whether you want kernel math emulation or
not, etc. One of these asks you whether you want TCP/IP networking
support. You must answer this with y to get a kernel capable of
networking.
