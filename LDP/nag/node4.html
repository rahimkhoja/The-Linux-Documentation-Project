The idea of networking is probably as old as telecommunications itself.
Consider people living in the stone age, where drums may have been used
to transmit messages between individuals. Suppose caveman A wants to
invite caveman B for a game of hurling rocks at each other, but they
live too far apart for B to hear A banging his drum. So what are A's
options? He could 1)-walk over to B's place, 2)-get a bigger drum, or
3)-ask C, who lives halfway between them, to forward the message. The
last is called networking.
<P>
Of course, we have come a long way from the primitive pursuits and
devices of our forebears. Nowadays, we have computers talk to each other
over vast assemblages of wires, fiber optics, microwaves, and the like,
to make an appointment for Saturday's soccer match.<A HREF="footnode.html#255"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> In the following, we will deal with the means and ways by which this
is accomplished, but leave out the wires, as well as the soccer part.

We will describe two types of networks in this guide: those based on
UUCP, and those based on TCP/IP. These are protocol suites and software
packages that supply means to transport data between two computers.  In
this chapter, we will look at both types of networks, and discuss their
underlying principles.

We define a network as a collection of <em>hosts</em> that are able to
communicate with each other, often by relying on the services of a
number of dedicated hosts that relay data between the participants.
Hosts are very often computers, but need not be; one can also think of
X-terminals or intelligent printers as hosts. Small agglomerations of
hosts are also called <em>sites</em>.

Communication is impossible without some sort of language or code. In
computer networks, these languages are collectively referred to as
<em>protocols</em>. However, you shouldn't think of written protocols
here, but rather of the highly formalized code of behavior observed
when heads of state meet, for instance.  In a very similar fashion,
the protocols used in computer networks are nothing but very strict
rules for the exchange of messages between two or more hosts.
