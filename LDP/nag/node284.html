To make a Null Printer Cable for use with a PLIP connection, you need
two 25-pin connectors (called DB-25) and some 11-conductor cable.
The cable must be at most 15-meters long.
<P>
If you look at the connector, you should be able to read tiny numbers
at the base of each pin, from 1 for the pin top left (if you hold the 
broader side up) to 25 for the pin bottom right. For the Null Printer 
cable, you have to connect the following pins of both connectors
with each other:

All remaining pins remain unconnected. If the cable is shielded,
the shield should be connected to the DB-25's metallic shell
on one end only.
