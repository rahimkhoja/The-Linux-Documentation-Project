There is a number of commands dip provides to configure your
serial line and modem. Some of these are obvious, such as
port, which selects a serial port, and speed,
databits, stopbits, and parity, which set
the common line parameters.
<P>
The modem command selects a modem type. Currently, the
only type supported is HAYES (capitalization required).
You have to provide dip with a modem type, else it will
refuse to execute the dial and reset commands.
The reset command sends a reset string to the modem;
the string used depends on the modem type selected. For
Hayes-compatible modems, this is ATZ.
<P>
The flush code can be used to flush out all responses
the modem has sent so far. Otherwise a chat script following the
reset might be confused, because it reads the OK
responses from earlier commands.
<P>
The init command selects an initialization string to be passed
to the modem before dialing. The default for Hayes modems is
``ATE0 Q0 V1 X1'', which turns on echoing of commands and long
result codes, and selects blind dialing (no checking of dial tone).
<P>
The dial command finally sends the initialization string to
the modem and dials up the remote system. The default dial command for
Hayes modems is ATD.
