<P>
These commands help implement simple chat scripts in dip.
send outputs its arguments to the serial line. It does not
support variables, but understands all C-style backslash character
sequences such as n and b.  The tilde
character () is used as an abbreviation for carriage
return/newline.
<P>
wait takes a word as an argument, and scans all input
on the serial line until it recognizes this word. The word itself
may not contain any blanks. Optionally, you may give wait
a timeout value as second argument; if the expected word is not
received within that many seconds, the command will return
with an $errlvl value of one.
<P>
The sleep statement may be used to wait for a certain amount
of time, for instance to patiently wait for any login sequence
to complete. Again, the interval is specified in seconds.
