If you know for sure that smail is lacking TCP network support,
you have to get the source. It is probably included in your
distribution, if you got it via CD-ROM, otherwise you may get it from
the net via FTP.<A HREF="footnode.html#7801"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
When compiling smail, you had best start with the set of
configuration files from Vince Skahan's newspak distribution. To
compile in the TCP networking driver, you have to set the
DRIVER_CONFIGURATION macro in the conf/EDITME file to either
bsd-network or arpa-network.  The former is suitable for LAN
installations, but the Internet requires arpa-network.  The
difference between these two is that the latter has a special driver for
BIND service that is able to recognize MX records, which the former
doesn't.
