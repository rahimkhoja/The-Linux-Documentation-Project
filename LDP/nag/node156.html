As with TCP/IP-based networking, your host has to have a name for UUCP
networking. As long as you simply want to use UUCP for file transfers to
or from sites you dial up directly, or on a local network, this name
does not have to meet any standards.<A HREF="footnode.html#5965"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
However, if you use UUCP for a mail or news link, you should think about
having the name registered with the UUCP Mapping project. The UUCP
Mapping Project is described in chapter-<A HREF="node186.html#mail"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. Even if you
participate in a domain, you might consider having an official UUCP name
for your site.
<P>
Frequently, people choose their UUCP name to match the first component
of their fully qualified domain name. Suppose your site's domain
address is swim.twobirds.com, then your UUCP host name would be
swim.  Think of UUCP sites as knowing each other on a
first-name basis.  Of course, you can also use a UUCP name completely
unrelated to your fully qualified domain name.
<P>
<A NAME="5969"></A>
However, make sure not to use the unqualified site name in mail
addresses unless you have registered it as your official UUCP
name.<A HREF="footnode.html#5970"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> At the very best, mail to an unregistered UUCP host will vanish in
some big black bit bucket. If you use a name already held by some other
site, this mail will be routed to that site, and cause its postmaster
no end of headaches.
<P>
By default, the UUCP suite uses the name set by hostname as the
site's UUCP name. This name is commonly set in the /etc/rc.local
script.  If your UUCP name is different from what you set your host name
to, you have to use the hostname option in the config
file to tell uucico about your UUCP name. This is described
below.
