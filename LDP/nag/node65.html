After setting up your hardware as explained in the previous chapter, you
have to make these devices known to the kernel networking software.  A
couple of commands are used to configure the network interfaces, and
initialize the routing table. These tasks are usually performed from the
rc.inet1 script each time the system is booted.  The basic tools for
this are called <A HREF="node73.html">ifconfig</A> (where ``if'' stands for interface), and
route.
<P>
ifconfig is used to make an interface accessible to the kernel
networking layer. This involves the assignment of an IP-address and other
parameters, and activating the interface, also known as ``taking up.''
Being active here means that the kernel will send and receive IP-datagrams
through the interface.  The simplest way to invoking it is
<Pre>
           ifconfig interface ip-address
 
</Pre>
which assigns ip-address to interface and activates it.
All other parameters are set to default values. For instance, the
default subnet mask is derived from the network class of the IP-address,
such as 255.255.0.0 for a class-B address.  ifconfig is
described in detail at the end of this chapter.
<P>
route allows you to add or remove routes from the kernel routing
table. It can be invoked as
<Pre>
           route [add|del] target
</Pre>
where the add and del arguments determine whether
to add or delete the route to target.
