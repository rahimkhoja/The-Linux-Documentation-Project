When using a PLIP link to connect two machines, things are a
little different from what you have to do when using an Ethernet.
The former are so-called <em>point-to-point</em> links, because
they involve only two hosts (``points''), as opposed
to broadcast networks.
<P>
As an example, we consider the laptop computer of some employee at
the Virtual Brewery that is connected to vlager via PLIP.
The laptop itself is called vlite, and has only one
parallel port. At boot time, this port will be registered as
plip1. To activate the link, you have to configure the
plip1 interface using the following commands:<A HREF="footnode.html#3180"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<Pre>
           # ifconfig plip1 vlite pointopoint vlager
           # route add default gw vlager
 
</pre>
The first command configures the interface, telling the kernel that this
is a point-to-point link, with the remote side having the address of
vlager. The second installs the default route, using
vlager as gateway.  On vlager, a similar ifconfig
command is necessary to activate the link (a route invocation is
not needed):
<Pre>
           # ifconfig plip1 vlager pointopoint vlite

 
</Pre>
The interesting point is that the plip1 interface on
vlager does not have to have a separate IP-address, but may also
be given the address 191.72.1.1.<A HREF="footnode.html#2854"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
Now, we have configured routing from the laptop to the Brewery's
network; what's still missing is a way to route from any of the
Brewery's hosts to vlite. One particularly cumbersome way is
to add a specific route to every host's routing table that names 
vlager as a gateway to vlite:
<pre>
           # route add vlite gw vlager

 
</Pre>
<A NAME="2860"></A>
<A NAME="2861"></A>
<A NAME="3181"></A>
<A NAME="2863"></A>
<A NAME="2864"></A>
A much better option when faced with temporary routes is to use dynamic
routing.  One way to do so is to use gated, a routing daemon,
which you would have to install on each host in the network in order
to distribute routing information dynamically.  The easiest way,
however, is to use <em>proxy</em> ARP. With proxy ARP, vlager will
respond to any ARP query for vlite by sending its own Ethernet
address. The effect of this is that all packets for vlite will wind
up at vlager, which then forwards them to the laptop. We will come
back to proxy ARP in section-<A HREF="#ifaceverifyarp"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> below.
<P>
Future Net-3 releases will contain a tool called plipconfig
which will allow you to set the IRQ of the printer port to use. Later,
this may even be replaced by a more general ifconfig command.
