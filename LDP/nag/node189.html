<A NAME="mailaddress"></A>
For electronic mail, an address is made up of at least the name of a
machine handling the person's mail, and a user identification recognized
by this system. This may be the recipient's login name, but may also be
anything else. Other mail addressing schemes, like X.400, use a more
general set of ``attributes'' which are used to look up the recipient's
host in an X.500 directory server.
<P>
The way a machine name is interpreted, i.e. at which site your message
will finally wind up, and how to combine this name with the recipient's
user name greatly depends on the network you are on.
<P>
Internet sites adhere to the RFC-822 standard, which requires a notation
of user@host.domain, where host.domain is the host's fully
qualified domain name. The middle thing is called an ``at'' sign.
Because this notation does not involve a route to the destination host
but gives the (unique) hostname instead, this is called an <em>absolute</em>
address.
<P>
In the original UUCP environment, the prevalent form was
path!host!user, where path described a sequence of hosts
the message had to travel before reaching the destination host.
This construct is called the <em>bang path</em> notation, because an
exclamation mark is loosely called a ``bang''.  Today, many UUCP-based
networks have adopted RFC-822, and will understand this type of
address.
<P>
Now, these two types of addressing don't mix too well. Assume an address
of hostA!user@hostB. It is not clear whether the `@' sign
takes precedence over the path, or vice versa: do we have to send the
message to hostB, which mails it to hostA!user, or should it
be sent to hostA, which forwards it to user@hostB?
<P>
Addresses that mix different types of address operators are called
<em>hybrid addresses</em>. Most notorious is the above example. It is
usually resolved by giving the `@' sign precedence over the
path. In the above example, this means sending the message to
hostB first.
<P>
However, there is a way to specify routes in RFC-822-conformant ways:
&lt;@hostA,@hostB:user@hostC&gt; denotes the address of user on
hostC, where hostC is to be reached through hostA
and hostB (in that order). This type of address is frequently
called a <em>route-addr address</em>.
<P>
Then, there is the `%' address operator: user%hostB@hostA
will first be sent to hostA, which expands the rightmost (in this
case, only) percent sign to an `@' sign. The address is now
user@hostB, and the mailer will happily forward your message to
hostB which delivers it to user.  This type of address is
sometimes referred to as ``Ye Olde ARPANET Kludge'', and its use is
discouraged. Nevertheless, many mail transport agents generate this
type of address.
<P>
Other networks have still different means of addressing. DECnet-based
networks, for example, use two colons as an address separator, yielding
an address of host::user.<A HREF="footnode.html#7189"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> Lastly, the X.400 standard uses an entirely different scheme, by
describing a recipient by a set of attribute-value pairs, like country
and organization.
<P>
On FidoNet, each user is identified by a code like 2:320/204.9,
consisting of four numbers denoting zone (2 is for Europe), net (320
being Paris and Banlieue), node (the local hub), and point (the
individual user's PC). Fidonet addresses can be mapped to RFC-822; the
above would be written as
Thomas.Quinot@p9.f204.n320.z2.fidonet.org. Now didn't I say
domain names are easy to remember?
<P>
There are some implications to using these different types of addressing
which will be described throughout the following sections. In a RFC-822
environment, however, you will rarely use anything else than absolute
addresses like user@host.domain.
