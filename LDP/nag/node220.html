Traditional sendmail is set up through a system configuration file (typically
/etc/sendmail.cf or /usr/lib/sendmail.cf), that is not anything
close to any language you've seen before. Editing the sendmail.cf file
to provide customized behavior can be a humbling experience.
<P>
Sendmail+IDA makes such pain essentially a thing of the past by having all
configuration options table-driven with rather easy to understand syntax.
These options are configured by running m4 (a macro processor) or
dbm (a database processor) on a number of data files via Makefiles
supplied with the sources.
<P>
The sendmail.cf file defines only the default behavior of the system.
Virtually all special customization is done through a number of optional
tables rather than by directly editing the sendmail.cf file.  A list
of all sendmail tables is given in figure-<A HREF="node220.html#sendmailfigtables"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
