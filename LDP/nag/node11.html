Of course, you wouldn't want your networking to be limited to one
Ethernet. Ideally, you would want to be able to use a network regardless
of what hardware it runs on and how many subunits it is made up of. For
example, in larger installations such as Groucho Marx University, you
usually have a number of separate Ethernets that have to be connected in
some way. At GMU, the maths department runs two Ethernets: one network
of fast machines for professors and graduates, and another one with slow
machines for students. Both are linked to the FDDI campus backbone.
<P>
This connection is handled by a dedicated host, a so-called <em>gateway</em>,
which handles incoming and outgoing packets by copying them between the two
Ethernets and the fiber optics cable.  For example, if you are at the Maths
Department, and want to access quark on the Physics Department's LAN
from your  box, the networking software cannot send packets to
quark directly, because it is not on the same Ethernet. Therefore,
it has to rely on the gateway to act as a forwarder. The gateway (name it
sophus) then forwards these packets to its peer gateway niels
at the Physics Department, using the backbone, with niels delivering
it to the destination machine. Data flow between erdos and
quark is shown in figure-<A HREF="node11.html#introfigipflow"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> (With apologies to
Guy L. Steele).

This scheme of directing data to a remote host is called <em>routing</em>,
and packets are often referred to as <em>datagrams</em> in this context.
To facilitate things, datagram exchange is governed by a single protocol
that is independent of the hardware used: IP, or <em>Internet
Protocol</em>.  In chapter-<A HREF="node23.html#tcpip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, we will cover IP and the issues of
routing in greater detail.

The main benefit of IP is that it turns physically dissimilar
networks into one apparently homogeneous network. This is called
internetworking, and the resulting ``meta-network'' is called
an <em>internet</em>. Note the subtle difference between <em>an</em>
internet and <em>the</em> Internet here. The latter is the official
name of one particular global internet.

Of course, IP also requires a hardware-independent addressing scheme.  This
is achieved by assigning each host a unique 32-bit number, called the
<em>IP-address</em>. An IP-address is usually written as four decimal numbers,
one for each 8-bit portion, separated by dots. For example, quark
might have an IP-address of 0x954C0C04, which would be written as
149.76.12.4.  This format is also called <em>dotted quad</em> notation.

You will notice that we now have three different types of addresses: first
there is the host's name, like quark, then there are IP-addresses,
and finally, there are hardware addresses, like the 6-byte Ethernet
address. All these somehow have to match, so that when you type
rlogin quark, the networking software can be given quark's
IP-address; and when IP delivers any data to the Physics Department's
Ethernet, it somehow has to find out what Ethernet address corresponds to
the IP-address.  Which is rather confusing.
<P>
We will not go into this here, and deal with it in chapter-<A HREF="node23.html#tcpip"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
instead. For now, it's enough to remember that these steps of finding
addresses are called <em>hostname resolution</em>, for mapping host names onto
IP-addresses, and <em>address resolution</em>, for mapping the latter to
hardware addresses.
