<H1><A NAME="SECTION0018200000">What <EM>is</EM> Usenet, Anyway?</A></H1>
One of the most astounding facts about Usenet is that it isn't part of
any organization, or has any sort of centralized network management
authority. In fact, it's part of Usenet lore that except for a technical
description, you cannot define <em>what</em> it is, you can only say what
it isn't. If you have Brendan Kehoe's excellent ``Zen and the Art of the
Internet'' (available online or through Prentice-Hall, see [<A HREF="#zen"></A>])
at hand, you will find an amusing list of Usenet's non-properties.
<P>
At the risk of sounding stupid, one might define Usenet as a
collaboration of separate sites who exchange Usenet news.  To be a
Usenet site, all you have to do is find another site Usenet site, and
strike an agreement with its owners and maintainers to exchange news
with you. Providing another site with news is also called <em>feeding</em>
it, whence another common axiom of Usenet philosophy originates: ``Get a
feed and you're on it.''
<P>
The basic unit of Usenet news is the article. This is a message a user
writes and ``posts'' to the net. In order to enable news systems to deal
with it, it is prepended with administrative information, the so-called
article header. It is very similar to the mail header format laid down
in the Internet mail standard RFC-822, in that it consists of several
lines of text, each beginning with a field name terminated by a colon,
which is followed by the field's value.<A HREF="footnode.html#8518"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
Articles are submitted to one or more <em>newsgroups</em>.  One may
consider a newsgroup a forum for articles relating to a common topic.
All newsgroups are organized in a hierarchy, with each group's name
indicating its place in the hierarchy. This often makes it easy to see
what a group is all about. For example, anybody can see from the
newsgroup name that comp.os.linux.announce is used for
announcements concerning a computer operating system named .
<P>
These articles are then exchanged between all Usenet sites that are
willing to carry news from this group.  When two sites agree to exchange
news, they are free to exchange whatever newsgroups they like to, and
may even add their own local news hierarchies. For example,
groucho.edu might have a news link to barnyard.edu, which
is a major news feed, and several links to minor sites which it feeds
news. Now, Barnyard College might receive all Usenet groups, while GMU
only wants to carry a few major hierarchies like sci,
comp, rec, etc. Some of the downstream sites, say a UUCP
site called brewhq, will want to carry even fewer groups, because
they don't have the network or hardware resources. On the other hand,
brewhq might want to receive newsgroups from the fj
hierarchy, which GMU doesn't carry. It therefore maintains another link
with gargleblaster.com, who carry all fj groups, and feed
them to  brewhq. The news flow is shown in
figure-<A HREF="node257.html#newsfigarticleflow"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

<P>The labels on the arrows originating from brewhq may require some
explanation, though.  By default, it wants all locally generated news to
be sent to groucho.edu.  However, as groucho.edu does not
carry the fj groups, there's no pointing in sending it any
messages from those groups.  Therefore, the feed from brewhq to
GMU is labeled all,!fj, meaning that all groups except those
below fj are sent to it.
