The dummy interface is really a little exotic, but rather useful
nevertheless. Its main benefit is with standalone hosts, and machines
whose only IP network connection is a dial-up link. In fact, the
latter are standalone hosts most of the time, too.
<P>
The dilemma with standalone hosts is that they only have a single network
device active, the loopback device, which is usually assigned
the address 127.0.0.1.  On some occasions, however, you need
to send data to the `official' IP address of the local host. For
instance, consider the laptop vlite, that has been disconnected
from any network for the duration of this example.  An application
on vlite may now want to send some data to another application on
the same host. Looking up vlite in /etc/hosts yields
an IP-address of 191.72.1.65, so the application tries to send
to this address. As the loopback interface is currently the only active
interface on the machine, the kernel has no idea that this address
actually refers to itself! As a consequence, the kernel discards the
datagram, and returns an error to the application.
<P>
This is where the dummy device steps in. It solves the dilemma by
simply serving as the alter ego of the loopback interface.  In the
case of vlite, you would simply give it the address
191.72.1.65 and add a host route pointing to it. Every datagram
for 191.72.1.65 would then be delivered locally. The proper
invocation is:

           # ifconfig dummy vlite
           # route add vlite
