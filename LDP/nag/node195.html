elm stands for ``electronic mail'' and is one of the more reasonably
named  tools. It provides a full-screen interface with a good help
feature. We won't discuss here how to use elm, but only dwell on its
configuration options.
<P>
Theoretically, you can run elm unconfigured, and everything works
well--- if you are lucky. But there are a few options that must be set,
although only required on occasions.
<P>
When it starts, elm reads a set of configuration variables from the
elm.rc file in /usr/lib/elm. Then, it will attempt to read the file
.elm/elmrc in your home directory. You don't usually write this file
yourself. It is created when you choose ``save options'' from elm's
options menu.
<P>
The set of options for the private elmrc file is also available
in the global elm.rc file. Most settings in your private
elmrc file override those of the global file.
