In this section, we'll take a look at how to install a typical binary
distribution of sendmail+IDA, and walk through what needs to be done to make
it localized and functional.
<P>
The current binary distribution of sendmail+IDA for  can be
gotten from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/system/Mail.
Even if you have an earlier version of sendmail I strongly recommend
you go to the sendmail5.67b+IDA1.5 version since all required
Linux-specific patches are now in the vanilla sources and several
significant security holes have been plugged that were in versions
prior to about December 1, 1993.
<P>

If you are building sendmail from the sources, you should
follow the instructions in the READMEs included in the source
distribution.  The current sendmail+IDA source is available from
vixen.cso.uiuc.edu.
To build sendmail+IDA on , you also need the -specific
configuration files from newspak-2.2.tar.gz, which is available on
sunsite.unc.edu in the /pub/Linux/system/Mail directory.
<P>
If you have previously installed smail or another mail
delivery agent, you'll probably want to remove (or rename) all the
files from smail to be safe.
