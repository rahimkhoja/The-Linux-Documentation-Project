Taylor UUCP provides a number of ways you may restrict the times when
calls can be placed to a remote system.  You might do this either
because of limitations the remote host places on its services during
business hours, or simply to avoid times with high call rates. Note
that it is always possible to override call time restrictions by
giving uucico the -S or -f option.
<P>
By default, Taylor UUCP will disallow connections at any time, so you
<em>have</em> to use some sort of time specification in the sys
file.  If you don't care about call time restrictions, you can specify
the time option with a value of Any in your
sys file.
<P>
The simplest way to restrict call time is the time entry,
which is followed by a string made up of a day and a time subfield.
Day may be any of Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su combined, or
Any, Never, or Wk for weekdays. The time
consists of two 24-hour clock values, separated by a dash. They
specify the range during which calls may be placed. The combination of
these tokens is written without white space in between.  Any number of
day and time specifications may be grouped together with commas.  For
example,
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
allows calls on Monday and Wednesdays from 3-a.m. to 7.30, and on
Fridays between 18.05 and 20.00.  When a time field spans midnight, say
Mo1830-0600, it actually means Monday, between midnight and
6-a.m., and between 6.30-p.m. and midnight.
<P>
The special time strings Any and Never mean what
they say: Calls may be placed at any or no time, respectively.

The time command takes an optional second argument that
describes a retry time in minutes. When an attempt to establish a
connection fails, uucico will not allow another attempt to dial
up the remote host within a certain interval. By default,
uucico uses an exponential backoff scheme, where the retry
interval increases with each repeated failure.  For instance, when you
specify a retry time of 5 minutes, uucico will refuse to call
the remote system within 5 minutes after the last failure.

The timegrade command allows you to attach a maximum spool
grade to a schedule. For instance, assume you have the following
timegrade commands in a system entry:
<P>
<P><P>
<P>
This allows jobs with a spoolgrade of C or higher (usually, mail is
queued with grade B or C) to be transferred whenever a call is
established, while news (usually queued with grade N) will be
transferred only during the night and at weekends.
<P>
Just like time, the timegrade command takes
a retry interval in minutes as an optional third argument.
<P>
However, a caveat about spool grades is in order here: First, the
timegrade option applies only to what <em>your</em> systems
sends; the remote system may still transfer anything it likes.  You can
use the call-timegrade option to explicitly request it to send
only jobs above some given spool grade; but there's no guarantee it will
obey this request.<A HREF="footnode.html#6127"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
Similarly, the timegrade field is not checked when a remote
system calls in, so any jobs queued for the calling system will be sent.
However, the remote system can explicitly request your uucico to
restrict itself to a certain spool grade.
