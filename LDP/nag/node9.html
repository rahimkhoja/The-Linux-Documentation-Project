The type of hardware most widely used throughout LANs is what is
commonly known as <em>Ethernet</em>.  It consists of a single cable with
hosts being attached to it through connectors, taps or transceivers.
Simple Ethernets are quite inexpensive to install, which, together with
a net transfer rate of 10 Megabits per second accounts for much of its
popularity.
<P>
Ethernets come in three flavors, called <em>thick</em> and <em>thin</em>,
respectively, and <em>twisted pair</em>.  Thin and thick Ethernet each use
a coaxial cable, differing in width and the way you may attach a host to
this cable. Thin Ethernet uses a T-shaped ``BNC'' connector, which you
insert into the cable, and twist onto a plug on the back of your
computer.  Thick Ethernet requires that you drill a small hole into the
cable, and attach a transceiver using a ``vampire tap''. One or more
hosts can then be connected to the transceiver.  Thin and thick Ethernet
cable may run for a maximum of 200 and 500-meters, respectively, and are
therefore also called 10base-2 and 10base-5.  Twisted pair uses a cable
made of two copper wires which is also found in ordinary telephone
installations, but usually requires additional hardware. It is also
known as 10base-T.
<P>
Although adding a host to a thick Ethernet is a little hairy, it does not
bring down the network. To add a host to a thinnet installation, you have
to disrupt network service for at least a few minutes because you have to
cut the cable to insert the connector.
<P>
Most people prefer thin Ethernet, because it is very cheap: PC cards come
for as little as US$50, and cable is in the range of a few cent per
meter. However, for large-scale installations, thick Ethernet is more
appropriate. For example, the Ethernet at GMU's Mathematics Department uses
thick Ethernet, so traffic will not be disrupted each time a host is added
to the network.
<P>
One of the drawbacks of Ethernet technology is its limited cable length,
which precludes any use of it other than for LANs. However, several
Ethernet segments may be linked to each other using repeaters, bridges or
routers. Repeaters simply copy the signals between two or more segments, so
that all segments together will act as if it was one Ethernet.  timing requirements, there may not be more than four repeaters any two hosts on the network.  Bridges and Routers are more sophisticated.
They analyze incoming data and forward it only when the recipient host is
not on the local Ethernet.
<P>
Ethernet works like a bus system, where a host may send packets (or
<em>frames</em>) of up to 1500 bytes to another host on the same Ethernet.
A host is addressed by a six-byte address hard-coded into the firmware of
its Ethernet board. These addresses are usually written as a sequence of
two-digit hex numbers separated by colons, as in aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff.
<P>
A frame sent by one station is seen by all attached stations, but only
the destination host actually picks it up and processes it.  If two
stations try to send at the same time, a <em>collision</em> occurs, which
is resolved by the two stations aborting the send, and re-attempting it a
few moments later.
