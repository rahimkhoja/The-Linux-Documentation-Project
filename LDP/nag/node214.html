<P>
Instead of using the aliases file, mailing lists may also be
managed by means of files in the /usr/lib/smail/lists directory. A
mailing list named nag-bugs is described by the file
lists/nag-bugs, which should contain the members' addresses,
separated by commas. The list may be given on multiple lines, with
comments being introduced by a hash sign.
<P>
For each mailing list, a user (or alias) named
owner-listname should exist; any errors occurring when
resolving an address are reported to this user. This address is also
used as the sender's address on all outgoing messages in the
Sender: header field.
