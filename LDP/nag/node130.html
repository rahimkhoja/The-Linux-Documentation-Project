When you are running a local area network, your overall goal is usually
to provide an environment to your users that makes the network
transparent.  An important stepping stone to this end is to keep vital
data such as user account information synchronized between all hosts.
We have seen before that for host name resolution, a powerful and
sophisticated service exists, being DNS. For others tasks, there is no
such specialized service. Moreover, if you manage only a small LAN with
no Internet connectivity, setting up DNS may not seem worth the trouble
for many administrators.
<P>
This is why Sun developed NIS, the <em>Network Information System</em>.
NIS provides generic database access facilities that can be used to
distribute information such as that contained in the passwd and
groups files to all hosts on your network.  This makes the
network appear just as a single system, with the same accounts on all
hosts. In a similar fashion, you can use NIS to distribute the hostname
information form /etc/hosts to all machines on the network.
<P>
NIS is based on RPC, and comprises a server, a client-side library, and
several administrative tools.  Originally, NIS was called <em>Yellow
Pages</em>, or YP, which is still widely used to informally refer this
service. On the other hand, Yellow Pages is a trademark of British
Telecom, which required Sun to drop that name. As things go, some
names stick with people, and so YP lives on as a prefix to the names
of most NIS-related commands such as ypserv, ypbind,
etc.

Today, NIS is available for virtually all , and there are even
free implementations of it. One is from the BSD Net-2 release, and has
been derived from a public domain reference implementation donated by
Sun.  The library client code from this release has been in the GNU
libc for a long time, while the administrative programs have only
recently been ported to  by Swen Th&#252;mmler.<A HREF="footnode.html#5317"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> An NIS server is missing from the reference implementation.  Tobias
Reber has written another NIS package including all tools and a server;
it is called yps.<A HREF="footnode.html#5318"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A>

Currently, a complete rewrite of the NIS code called NYS is being done
by Peter Eriksson,<A HREF="footnode.html#5320"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> which supports both plain NIS and Sun's much revised NIS+. NYS
not only provides a set of NIS tools and a server, but also adds a whole
new set of library functions which will most probably make it into the
standard libc eventually. This includes a new configuration scheme
for hostname resolution that replaces the current scheme using
host.conf. The features of these functions will be discussed
below.
<P>
This chapter will focus on NYS rather than the other two packages, to which
I will refer as the ``traditional'' NIS code. If you do want to run any of
these packages, the instructions in this chapter may or may not be enough.
To obtain additional information, please get a standard book on NIS, such
as Hal Stern's <em>NFS and NIS</em> (see-[<A HREF="#sternnfs"></A>]).
<P>
For the time being, NYS is still under development, and therefore standard
 utilities such as the network programs or the login program
are not yet aware of the NYS configuration scheme.  Until NYS is merged
into the mainstream libc you therefore have to recompile all these
binaries if you want to make them use NYS.  In any of these applications'
Makefiles, specify -lnsl as the last option before
libc to the linker. This links in the relevant functions from
libnsl, the NYS library, instead of the standard C-library.
