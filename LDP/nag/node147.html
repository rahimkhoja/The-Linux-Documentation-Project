UUCP was designed in the late seventies by Mike Lesk at AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories to provide a simple dial-up network over public telephone
lines. Since most people that want to have email and Usenet News on
their home machine still communicate through modems, UUCP has remained
very popular.  Although there are many implementations running on a
wide variety of hardware platforms and operating systems, they are
compatible to a high degree.
<P>
However, as with most software that has somehow become ``standard'' over
the years, there is no UUCP which one would call <em>the</em> UUCP.  It
has undergone a steady process of evolution since the first version
which was implemented in 1976.  Currently, there are two major species
which differ mainly in their support of hardware and their
configuration.  Of these, various implementations exist, each varying
slightly from its siblings.
<P>
<A NAME="5612"></A>
One species is the so-called ``Version 2 UUCP'', which dates back to
a 1977 implementation by Mike Lesk, David A. Novitz, and Greg Chesson.
Although it is fairly old, it is still in frequent use. Recent
implementations of Version 2 provide much of the comfort of the newer
UUCP species.

The second species was developed in 1983, and is commonly referred
to as BNU (Basic Networking Utilities), HoneyDanBer UUCP, or HDB for
short.  The name is derived from the authors' names, P.-Honeyman,
D.-A.-Novitz, and B.-E.-Redman.  HDB was conceived to eliminate some of
Version 2 UUCP's deficiencies.  For example, new transfer protocols were
added, and the spool directory was split so that now there is one
directory for each site you have UUCP traffic with.

<A NAME="5619"></A>
<A NAME="5620"></A>
The implementation of UUCP currently distributed with  is Taylor
UUCP-1.04,<A HREF="footnode.html#5622"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></A> which is the version this chapter is based upon.  Taylor UUCP Version
1.04 was released in February 1993.  Apart from traditional
configuration files, Taylor UUCP may also be compiled to understand the
new-style-- a.k.a. ``Taylor''-- configuration files.
<P>
Version 1.05 has been released recently, and will soon make its way into
most distributions. The differences between these versions mostly affect
features you will never use, so you should be able to configure Taylor
UUCP-1.05 using the information form this book.
<P>
As included in most  distributions, Taylor UUCP is usually
compiled for BNU compatibility, or the Taylor configuration scheme, or
both.  As the latter is much more flexible, and probably easier to
understand than the often rather obscure BNU configuration files, I
will describe the Taylor scheme below.
<P>
The purpose of this chapter is not to give you an exhaustive description
of what the command line options for the UUCP commands are and what they
do, but to give you an introduction on how to set up a working UUCP
node.  The first section gives a hopefully gentle introduction about how
UUCP implements remote execution and file transfers. If you are not
entirely new to UUCP, you might want to skip this and move on to
section-<A HREF="#uucpconfigfiles"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, which explains the various files used
to set up UUCP.
<P>
We will however assume that you are familiar with the user programs of
the UUCP suite. These are uucp and uux. For a description,
please refer to the on-line manual pages.
<P>
Besides the publicly accessible programs, uux and uucp,
the UUCP suite contains a number of commands used for administrative
purposes only. They are used to monitor UUCP traffic across your node,
remove old log files, or compile statistics. None of these will be
described here, because they're peripheral to the main tasks of UUCP.
Besides, they're well documented and fairly easy to understand.
However, there is a third category, which comprises the actual UUCP
``work horses''.  They are called uucico (where cico stands for
copy-in copy-out), and uuxqt, which executes jobs sent from
remote systems.
