If you are using one of the pre-packaged  distributions, it
will most probably contain the major networking applications and
utilities along with a coherent set of sample files.  The only case
where you might have to obtain and install new utilities is when you
install a new kernel release. As they occasionally involve changes in
the kernel networking layer, you will need to update the basic
configuration tools. This at least involves recompiling, but sometimes
you may also be required to obtain the latest set of binaries.  These
are usually distributed along with the kernel, packaged in an archive
called net-XXX.tar.gz, where XXX is the version
number. The release matching -1.0 is 0.32b, the latest
kernel as of this writing (1.1.12 and later) require 0.32d.
<P>
If you want to compile and install the standard TCP/IP network
applications yourself, you can obtain the sources from most 
FTP servers.  These are more or less heavily patched versions of
programs from Net-BSD or other sources.  Other applications, such as
Xmosaic, xarchie, or Gopher and IRC clients must be
obtained separately.  Most of them compile out of the box if you
follow the instructions.

The official FTP site for Net-3 is sunacm.swan.ac.uk, mirrored
by sunsite.unc.edu below system/Network/sunacm.  The
latest Net-2e patch kit and binaries are available from
ftp.aris.com.  Matthias Urlichs' BSD-derived networking code
can be gotten from ftp.ira.uka.de in
/pub/system/linux/netbsd.
