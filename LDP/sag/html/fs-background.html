>This chapter is loosely based on the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Filesystems
	Hierarchy Standard</I
> (FHS).
	version 2.1, which attempts to
	set a standard for how the directory tree in a Linux
	system is organized. Such a standard has the advantage that it will
	be easier to write or port software for Linux, and to administer
	Linux machines, since everything should be in standardized places.
	There is no authority behind the standard that forces anyone to
	comply with it, but it has gained the support of many Linux
	distributions. It is not a good idea to break with the FHS without
	very compelling reasons.  The FHS attempts to follow Unix tradition
	and current trends, making Linux systems familiar to those with
	experience with other Unix systems, and vice versa.</P
><P
>This chapter is not as detailed as the FHS.  A system
	administrator should also read the full FHS for a complete
	understanding.</P
><P
>This chapter does not explain all files in detail. The
	intention is not to describe every file, but to give an overview of
	the system from a filesystem point of view. Further information on
	each file is available elsewhere in this manual or in the Linux
	manual pages.</P
><P
>The full directory tree is intended to be breakable into
	smaller parts, each capable of being on its own disk or partition,
	to accommodate to disk size limits and to ease backup and other
	system administration tasks.  The major parts are the root
	(<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

        ), 
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
>
        ,
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var</TT
>
        , and

CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
>
         filesystems 
	(see <A
HREF="fs-background.html#FSTREE"
>Figure 3-1</A
>).  Each part has a
	different purpose. The directory tree has been designed so that it
	works well in a network of Linux machines which may share some parts
	of the filesystems over a read-only device (e.g., a CD-ROM), or over
	the network with NFS.</P

>The root filesystem
		 is specific for
		each machine (it is generally stored on a local disk,
		although it could be a ramdisk or network drive as well) and
		contains the files that are necessary for booting the system
		up, and to bring it up to such a state that the other
		filesystems may be mounted.  The contents of the root
		filesystem will therefore be sufficient for the single user
		state.	It will also contain tools for fixing a broken
		system, and for recovering lost files
		from backups.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
>
		 filesystem
		contains all commands, libraries, manual pages, and other
		unchanging files needed during normal operation. No files in
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
> should be specific for any given
		machine, nor should they be modified during normal use. This
		allows the files to be shared over the network, which can be
		cost-effective since it saves disk space (there can easily
		be hundreds of megabytes, increasingly multiple gigabytes in
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
>).  It can make administration
		easier (only the master <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
> needs to
		be changed when updating an application, not each machine
		separately) to have /usr network mounted.  Even if the
		filesystem is on a local disk, it could be mounted
		read-only, to lessen the chance of filesystem corruption 
		during a crash.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var</TT
>
		
		filesystem contains files that change, such as spool
		directories (for mail, news, printers, etc), log files,
		formatted manual pages, and temporary files. Traditionally
		everything in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var</TT
> has been somewhere
		below <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
>
		, but that made it 
		impossible to mount <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
> read-only.
		</P
><P
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
> The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
>
		
		filesystem contains the users' home directories, i.e., all
		the real data on the system.  Separating home directories to
		their own directory tree or filesystem makes backups easier;
		the other parts often do not have to be backed up, or at
		least not as often as they seldom change. A big
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
> might have to be broken across
		several filesystems, which requires adding an extra naming
		level below <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home</TT
>, for example
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/students</TT
> and
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/home/staff</TT
>.</P
></LI
></UL

><P
>Although the different parts have been called filesystems
	above, there is no requirement that they actually be on separate
	filesystems.  They could easily be kept in a single one if the
	system is a small single-user system and the user wants to keep
	things simple.	The directory tree might also be divided into
	filesystems differently, depending on how large the disks are, and
	how space is allocated for various purposes.  The important part,
	though, is that all the standard <EM
>names</EM
> work;
	even if, say, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var</TT
>
	 and
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr</TT
>
        are actually on the same partition, the names
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/libc.a</TT
> and
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/log/messages</TT
> must work, for example by
	moving files below <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var</TT
> into
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/var</TT
>, and making <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var</TT
>
	a symlink to
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/var</TT
>.</P
><P
>The Unix filesystem structure groups files according to 
	purpose, i.e., all commands are in one place, all data files in
	another, documentation in a third, and so on.  An alternative would
	be to group files files according to the program they belong to,
	i.e., all Emacs files would be in one directory, all TeX in another,
	and so on.  The problem with the latter approach is that it makes it
	difficult to share files (the program directory often contains both
	static and sharable and changing and non-sharable files), and
	sometimes to even find the files (e.g., manual pages in a huge
	number of places, and making the manual page programs find all of
	them is a maintenance
	nightmare).</P
