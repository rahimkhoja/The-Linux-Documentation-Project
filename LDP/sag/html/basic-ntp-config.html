>14.6. Basic NTP configuration</H1
><P
>The NTP program is configured using either the 
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ntp.conf	</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/xntp.conf</TT
> 
	file depending on what distribution of Linux you have.  I won't go 
	into too much detail on how to configure NTP.  Instead I'll just 
	cover the basics.</P
><P
>An example of a basic ntp.conf file would look like:

<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
># --- GENERAL CONFIGURATION ---
server  aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
server  127.127.1.0
fudge   127.127.1.0 stratum 10

# Drift file.

driftfile /etc/ntp/drift</TT
>
	</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>The most basic ntp.conf file will simply list 2 servers, one 
	that it wishes to synchronize with, and a pseudo IP address for
	itself (in this case 127.127.1.0). The pseudo IP is used in case of 
	network problems or if the remote NTP server goes down. NTP will 
	synchronize against itself until the it can start synchronizing with 
	the remote server again.  It is recommended that you list at 
	least 2 remote servers that you can synchronize against.  One will 
	act as a primary server and the other as a backup.</P
><P
>You should also list a location for a drift file.  Over time
	NTP will "learn" the system clock's error rate and automatically 
	adjust for it.</P
><P
>The restrict option can be used to provide better control and
	security over what NTP can do, and who can effect it.  For example:

<TABLE
BORDER="1"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
># Prohibit general access to this service.
restrict default ignore

# Permit systems on this network to synchronize with this
# time service. But not modify our time.
restrict aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd nomodify

# Allow the following unrestricted access to ntpd

restrict aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
restrict 127.0.0.1</TT
></PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

	It is advised that you wait until you have NTP working properly before
	adding the restrict option.  You can accidental restrict yourself from
	synchronizing and waste time debugging why.
	</P
><P
>NTP slowly corrects your systems time.  Be patient!  A simple test
	is to change your system clock by 10 minutes before you go to bed and then
	check it when you get up.  The time should be correct.</P
><P
>Many people get the idea that instead of running the NTP
	daemon, they should just setup a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron</B
> job 
	job to periodically run the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ntpdate</B
> command.
	There are 2 main disadvantages of using using this method.</P
><P
>The first is that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ntpdate</B
> does a "brute force"
	method of changing the time.  So if your computer's time is off my 5 
	minutes, it immediately corrects it.  In some environments, this can 
	cause problems if time drastically changes.  For example, if you are 
	using time sensitive security software, you can inadvertently kill
	someones access.  The NTP daemon slowly changes the time to avoid 
	causing this kind of disruption.</P
><P
>The other reason is that the NTP daemon can be configured to
	try to learn your systems <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>time drift</I
> and 
	then automatically adjust for it.</P
