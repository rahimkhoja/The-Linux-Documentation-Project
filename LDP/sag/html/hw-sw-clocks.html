>14.2. The hardware and software clocks</H1
><P
> A personal computer has a battery driven hardware clock.
	The battery ensures that the clock will work even if the rest of
	the computer is without electricity.  The hardware clock can be
	set from the BIOS setup screen or from whatever operating system
	is running.  </P
><P
> The Linux kernel keeps track of time independently from
	the hardware clock.  During the boot, Linux sets its own clock
	to the same time as the hardware clock.  After this, both clocks
	run independently.  Linux maintains its own clock because looking
	at the hardware is slow and complicated.  </P
><P
> The kernel clock always shows universal time.  This way,
	the kernel does not need to know about time zones at all. The
	simplicity results in higher reliability and makes it easier
	to update the time zone information.  Each process handles time
	zone conversions itself (using standard tools that are part of
	the time zone package).  </P
><P
> The hardware clock can be in local time or in universal
	time.  It is usually better to have it in universal time,
	because then you don't need to change the hardware clock when
	daylight savings time begins or ends (UTC does not have DST).
	Unfortunately, some PC operating systems, including MS-DOS,
	Windows, and OS/2, assume the hardware clock shows local time.
	Linux can handle either, but if the hardware clock shows local
	time, then it must be modified when daylight savings time begins
	or ends (otherwise it wouldn't show local time).  </P
