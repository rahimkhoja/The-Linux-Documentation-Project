	It is a complex technology, but put very simply it is a type

	As a result, it  does not lose what was	stored on it when the 
        power is switched off.

><DD
><P
>	A term which is used for two purposes and which can have two 
	subtly different meanings.  It is either the collection of 
	files and directories on a drive (whether hard drive, floppy,
	Cd-ROM, etc).  Or it is the markers put onto the disk media

	more parts of the disk surface.  This is known as <I

><P
>	A data structure holding information about files in a Unix 
	file system.  There is an inode for each file and a file is
	uniquely identified by the file system on which it resides 
	and its inode number on that system.  Each inode contains 
	the following information: the device where the inode resides, 
	locking information, mode and type of file, the number of links
	to the file, the owner's user and group ids, the number of bytes 
	in the file, access and modification times, the time the inode 
	itself was last modified and the addresses of the file's 
	blocks on disk.  A Unix directory is an association between 
	file leafnames and inode numbers.  A file's inode number 
	can be found using the "-i" switch to ls.
