>6.6. The buffer cache</H1
><P
>Reading from a disk
	is very slow compared to accessing (real) memory.  In addition,
	it is common to read the same part of a disk several times
	during relatively short periods of time.  For example, one
	might first read an e-mail message, then read the letter into
	an editor when replying to it, then make the mail program read
	it again when copying it to a folder.  Or, consider how often
	the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ls</B
> might be run on a system with
	many users.  By reading the information from disk only once
	and then keeping it in memory until no longer needed, one can
	speed up all but the first read.  This is called <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>disk
	buffering</I
>, and the memory used for the purpose is
	called the <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>buffer cache</I
>.</P
><P
>Since memory is, unfortunately, a finite, nay, scarce
	resource, the buffer cache usually cannot be big enough (it
	can't hold all the data one ever wants to use).  When the cache
	fills up, the data that has been unused for the longest time
	is discarded and the memory thus freed is used for the new
	data.</P
><P
>Disk buffering works for writes as well.	On the one hand,
	data that is written is often soon read again (e.g., a source
	code file is saved to a file, then read by the compiler),
	so putting data that is written in the cache is a good idea.
	On the other hand, by only putting the data into the cache, not
	writing it to disk at once, the program that writes runs quicker.
	The writes can then be done in the background, without slowing
	down the other programs.</P
><P
>Most operating systems have buffer caches (although
	they might be called something else), but not all of
	them work according to the above principles.  Some are
	<I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>write-through</I
>: the data is written to disk
	at once (it is kept in the cache as well, of course).  The cache
	is called <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>write-back</I
> if the writes are done
	at a later time.  Write-back is more efficient than write-through,
	but also a bit more prone to errors: if the machine crashes,
	or the power is cut at a bad moment, or the floppy is removed
	from the disk drive before the data in the cache waiting to be
	written gets written, the changes in the cache are usually lost.
	This might even mean that the filesystem (if there is one) is
	not in full working order, perhaps because the unwritten data
	held important changes to the bookkeeping information.</P
><P
>Because of this, you should never turn off the
	power without using a proper shutdown procedure 
	or remove a floppy from the
	disk drive until it has been unmounted (if it was mounted)
	or after whatever program is using it has signaled that it
	is finished and the floppy drive light doesn't shine anymore.
	The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sync</B
> command <I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>flushes</I
>
	the buffer, i.e., forces all unwritten data to be written to disk,
	and can be used when one wants to be sure that everything is
	safely written.  In traditional UNIX systems, there is a program
	called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>update</B
> running in the background
	which does a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sync</B
> every 30 seconds, so
	it is usually not necessary to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sync</B
>.
	Linux has an additional daemon, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bdflush</B
>,
	which does a more imperfect sync more frequently to avoid the
	sudden freeze due to heavy disk I/O that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sync</B
>
	sometimes causes.</P
><P
>Under Linux, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bdflush</B
> is started by
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>update</B
>.  There is usually no reason to worry
	about it, but if <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>bdflush</B
> happens to die for
	some reason, the kernel will warn about this, and you should
	start it by hand (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/sbin/update</B
>).</P
><P
>The cache does not actually buffer files, but blocks, which
	are the smallest units of disk I/O (under Linux, they are usually
	1 KB).	This way, also directories, super blocks, other filesystem
	bookkeeping data, and non-filesystem disks are cached.</P
><P
>The effectiveness of a cache is primarily decided by its
	size.  A small cache is next to useless: it will hold so little
	data that all cached data is flushed from the cache before it
	is reused.  The critical size depends on how much data is read
	and written, and how often the same data is accessed.  The only
	way to know is to experiment.</P
><P
>If the cache is of a fixed size, it is not very good to have
	it too big, either, because that might make the free memory too
	small and cause swapping (which is also slow).	To make the most
	efficient use of real memory, Linux automatically uses all free
	RAM for buffer cache, but also automatically makes the cache
	smaller when programs need more memory.</P
><P
>Under Linux, you do not need to do anything to make use
	of the cache, it happens completely automatically.  Except for
	following the proper procedures for shutdown and removing
	floppies, you do not need to worry about it.  </P
