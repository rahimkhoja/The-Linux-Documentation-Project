>18.2. IRC</H1
><P
>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is not covered in the Eric Raymond 
	document, but IRC can also be an excellent way of finding the answers you need.  
	However it does require some practice in asking questions in the right way.  
	Most IRC networks have busy #linux channels and if the answer to your question
	is contained in the man pages, or in the HOWTOs then expect to be told 
	to go read them.  The rule about typing in clear and grammatical English
	still applies.</P
><P
>Most of what has been said about newsgroups and mailing lists 
	is still relevant for IRC, with a the following additions</P

NAME="COLOURS"

>18.2.1. Colours</H2
><P
>Do not use colours, bold, underline or strange (non ASCII)
	characters.  This breaks some older terminals and is just plain ugly 
	to look at.  If you arrive in a channel and start spewing colour or bold
	then expect to be kicked out.</P

>18.2.2. Be Polite</H2
><P
>Remember you are not entitled to an answer.  If you ask the
	question in the right way then you will probably get one, but you have
	no right to get one.  The people in Linux IRC channels are all there 
	on their own time, nobody is paying them, especially not you.</P
><P
>Be polite.  Treat others as you would like to be
	treated.  If you think people are not being polite to you then don't
	start calling them names or getting annoyed, become even politer.  
	This makes them look foolish rather than dragging you down to their level.</P
><P
>Don't go slapping anyone with large trouts.  Would you believe 
	this has been done before once or twice?  And that we it wasn't
	funny the first time?</P

>18.2.3. Type Properly, in English</H2
><P
>Most #linux channels are English channels.  Speak English whilst
	in them.  Most of the larger IRC networks also have #linux channel in
	other languages, for example the French language channel might be
	called #linuxfr, the Spanish one might be #linuxes or #linuxlatino.  
	If you can't find the right channel then asking in the main #linux 
	channel (preferably in English) should help you find the one you are looking
	for.</P
><P
>Do not type like a ``1337 H4X0R d00d!!!''.  Even if other people
	are.  It looks silly and thereby makes you look silly.  At best you 
	will only look like an idiot, at worst you will be derided then kicked 
	out.</P

>18.2.4. Port scanning</H2
><P
>Never <EM
>ever</EM
> ask anyone to port scan you, or 
	try to ``hack'' you.  This is inviolable.  There is no way of knowing that
	you are who you say you are, or that the IP that you are connected 
	from belongs to you.  Don't put people in the position where they have to 
	say no to a request like this.</P
><P
><EM
>Don't ever port scan anyone</EM
>, even if they 
	ask you to.  You have no way to tell
	that they are who they say they are or that the IP they are connected 
	from is their own IP.  In some jurisdictions port scanning may be illegal 
	and it is certainly against the Terms of Service of most ISPs.
	Most people log TCP connections, they will notice they are being
	scanned.  Most people <EM
>will</EM
> report you to your ISP
	for this (it is trivial to find out who that is).</P

	Uncle Bob Got Up To Last Weekend'' channel.  Even if you see other
	people being off topic, this does not mean that you should be.  They 
	are probably channel regulars and different conventions apply to
	them.</P

	version or CTCP anything, then think again.  It is liable to get you
	kicked out very quickly.</P
><P
>If you are not familiar with IRC, CTCP stands for Client To
	Client Protocol.  It is a method whereby you can find out things 
	about other peoples' clients.  See the documentation for your IRC

	way to be unceremoniously kicked out.</P
><P
>Don't be in hacker/cracker/phreaker/warezer channels whilst in a
	#linux channel.  For some reason the people in charge of #linux 
	channels seem to hate people who like causing destruction to people's machines
	or who like to steal software.  Can't imagine why.</P

	 The DOs were already pretty much covered in the section on newsgroups and
	mailing lists.</P
><P
>Probably the best thing you can do is to go into a #linux 
	channel, sit there and watch, getting the feel for a half hour before
	you say anything.  This can help you to recognize the correct tone you
	should be using.</P

>18.2.10. Further Reading</H2
><P
>There are excellent FAQs about how to get the most of IRC #linux
	channels.  Most #linux channels have an FAQ and/or set or channel 
	rules. How to find this will usually be in the channel topic (which you can 
	see at any time using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/topic</B
> command.  Make sure 
	you read the rules if there are any and follow them.  One fairly generic 
	set of rules and advice is the ``Undernet #linux FAQ'' which can be found
