<b>This book is for Linux enthusiasts who want to know how the Linux kernel
works. It is not an internals manual.  Rather it describes the principles
and mechanisms that Linux uses; how and why the Linux kernel works the
way that it does. <p>Linux is a moving target; this book is based upon the
current, stable, 2.0.33 sources as those are what most individuals and companies
are now using.</b>
