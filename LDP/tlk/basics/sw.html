A program is a  set of computer instructions that perform a particular task.
That program can be written in assembler, a very low level computer language,
or in a high level, machine independent language such as the C programming 
language.
An operating system is a special program which allows the user to run applications such as
spreadsheets and word processors.
This chapter introduces basic programming principles and gives an  overview of
the aims and functions of an operating system.

<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc2.1">2.1&nbsp;</A> Computer Languages</H2>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.1.1">2.1.1&nbsp;</A> Assembly Languages</H3>

<p>
The instructions that a CPU fetches from memory and executes are not at all understandable
to human beings.
They are machine codes which tell the computer precisely what to do.
The hexadecimal number <em>0x89E5</em> is an Intel 80486 instruction which copies the contents
of the ESP register to the EBP register.
One of the first software tools invented for the earliest computers was an assembler,
a program which takes a human readable source file and assembles it into
machine code.
Assembly languages explicitly handle registers and operations on
data and they are specific to a particular microprocessor.
The assembly language for an Intel X86 microprocessor is very different
to the assembly language for an Alpha AXP&nbsp;microprocessor.
The following Alpha AXP&nbsp;assembly code shows the sort of operations that a 
program can perform:

<pre>
    ldr r16, (r15)    ; Line 1
    ldr r17, 4(r15)   ; Line 2
    beq r16,r17,100   ; Line 3
    str r17, (r15)    ; Line 4
100:                  ; Line 5

</pre>
<p>
The first statement (on line 1) loads register 16 from the
address held in register 15.
The next instruction loads register 17 from the next location in
memory.
Line 3 compares the contents of register 16 with that of register 17
and, if they are equal, branches to label <em>100</em>.
If the registers do not contain the same value then the program 
continues to line 4 where the contents of r17 are saved into memory.
If the registers do contain the same value then no data needs to
be saved.
Assembly level programs are tedious and tricky to write and prone to
errors.
Very little of the Linux kernel is written in assembly language and
those parts that are are written only for efficiency and they are
specific to particular microprocessors.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.1.2">2.1.2&nbsp;</A> The C Programming Language and Compiler</H3>

<p>
Writing large programs in assembly language is a difficult and time
consuming task.
It is prone to error and the resulting program is not portable, being
tied to one particular processor family.
It is far better to use a machine independent language 
like C.
C allows you to describe programs in terms of their logical algorithms and the data
that they operate on.
Special programs called compilers read the C program and translate
it into assembly language, generating machine specific code from it.
A good compiler can generate assembly instructions that are very 
nearly as efficient as those written by a good assembly programmer.
Most of the Linux kernel is written in the C language.
The following C fragment:

<pre>
        if (x != y)
                x = y ;
</pre>
<p>
performs exactly the same operations as the previous example assembly code.
If the contents of the variable <tt>x</tt> are not the same as the contents
of variable <tt>y</tt> then the contents of <tt>y</tt> will be copied to <tt>x</tt>.
C code is organized into routines, each of which perform a task.
Routines may return any value or data type supported by C.
Large programs like the Linux kernel comprise many separate C source
modules each with its own routines and data structures.
These C source code modules group together logical functions such as
filesystem handling code.

<p>
C supports many types of variables, a variable is a location in memory which
can be referenced by a symbolic name.
In the above C fragment <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> refer to locations in memory.
The programmer does not care where in memory the variables are put, it
is the linker (see below) that has to worry about that.
Some variables contain different sorts of data,
integer and floating point and others are pointers.

<p>
Pointers are variables that contain the address, the location in memory
of other data.
Consider a variable called <em>x</em>, it might live in memory at address <em>0x80010000</em>.
You could have a pointer, called <em>px</em>, which points at <em>x</em>.
<em>px</em> might live at address <em>0x80010030</em>.
The value of <em>px</em> would be <em>0x80010000</em>: the address of the variable <em>x</em>.

<p>
C allows you to bundle together related variables into data structures.
For example,

<pre>
        struct {
                int i ;
                char b ;
        } my_struct ;
</pre>
<p>
is a data structure called <tt>my_struct</tt> which contains two elements,
an integer (32 bits of data storage) called <tt>i</tt> and a character (8 bits
of data) called <tt>b</tt>.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.1.3">2.1.3&nbsp;</A> Linkers</H3>

<p>
Linkers are programs that link together several object modules and libraries
to form a single, coherent, program.
Object modules are the machine code output from an assembler or compiler and contain
executable machine code and data together with information that allows the linker
to combine the modules together to form a program.
For example one module might contain all of a program's database functions and
another module its command line argument handling functions.
Linkers fix up references between these object modules, where a routine or data
structure referenced in one module actually exists in another module.
The Linux kernel is a single, large program linked together from its
many constituent object modules.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2">2.2&nbsp;</A> What is an Operating System?</H2>

<p>
Without software a computer is just a pile of electronics that gives off heat.
If the hardware is the heart of a computer then the software is its soul.  
An operating system is a collection of system programs which allow the user to
run application software.
The operating system abstracts the real hardware of the system and presents
the system's users and its applications with a virtual machine.
In a very real sense the software provides
the character of the system.   Most PCs can run one or more operating
systems and each one can have a very different look and feel.
Linux is made up of a number of functionally
separate pieces that, together, comprise the operating system.  One 
obvious part of Linux is the kernel itself; but even that would be useless 
without libraries or shells.   

<p>
In order to start understanding what an operating system is, 
consider what happens when you type an apparently simple command:

<pre>

$ ls
Mail            c               images          perl
docs            tcl
$ 

</pre>
<p>
The $ is a prompt put out by a login shell (in this case <tt>bash</tt>).
This means that it is waiting for you, the user, to type some command.  Typing
<font face="helvetica">ls</font> causes the keyboard driver to recognize that characters have 
been typed.  The keyboard driver
passes them to the shell which processes that command
by looking for an executable image of the same name.  
It finds that image,
in <tt>/bin/ls</tt>.  Kernel services are called to pull the <font face="helvetica">ls</font> 
executable image into virtual memory and start executing it.  The <font face="helvetica">ls</font>
image makes calls to the file subsystem of the kernel to find out what files
are available.   
The filesystem might make use of cached filesystem 
information or use the disk device
driver to read this information from the disk.  
It might even cause a network driver to exchange information with
a remote machine to find out details of remote files that this system has
access to (filesystems can be remotely mounted via the Networked File System or NFS).
Whichever way the information is located, <font face="helvetica">ls</font>
writes that information out and the video driver displays it on the
screen.

<p>
All of the above seems rather complicated but it shows that even
most simple commands reveal that
an operating system is in fact a co-operating set of functions that 
together give you, the user, a coherent view of the system. 

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2.1">2.2.1&nbsp;</A> Memory management</H3>

<p>
With infinite resources, for example memory, many of the
things that an operating system has to do would be redundant.  
One of the basic tricks of any operating system is the ability to make a small amount
of physical memory behave like rather more memory.  
This apparently large memory is known as virtual memory.
The idea is that the software running in the system
is fooled into believing that it is running in a lot of memory.  
The system divides the memory into easily handled pages and swaps these pages onto a
hard disk as the system runs.  
The software does not notice because of another trick, multi-processing.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2.2">2.2.2&nbsp;</A> Processes</H3>

<p>
A process could be thought of as a program in action, each process is a separate entity that is
running a particular program.
If you look at the processes on your Linux system, you will see that
there are rather a lot.   For example, typing <font face="helvetica">ps</font> shows the
following processes on my system:

<pre>
$ ps
  PID TTY STAT  TIME COMMAND
  158 pRe 1     0:00 -bash
  174 pRe 1     0:00 sh /usr/X11R6/bin/startx
  175 pRe 1     0:00 xinit /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc --
  178 pRe 1 N   0:00 bowman
  182 pRe 1 N   0:01 rxvt -geometry 120x35 -fg white -bg black
  184 pRe 1 &lt;   0:00 xclock -bg grey -geometry -1500-1500 -padding 0
  185 pRe 1 &lt;   0:00 xload -bg grey -geometry -0-0 -label xload
  187 pp6 1     9:26 /bin/bash
  202 pRe 1 N   0:00 rxvt -geometry 120x35 -fg white -bg black
  203 ppc 2     0:00 /bin/bash
 1796 pRe 1 N   0:00 rxvt -geometry 120x35 -fg white -bg black
 1797 v06 1     0:00 /bin/bash
 3056 pp6 3 &lt;   0:02 emacs intro/introduction.tex
 3270 pp6 3     0:00 ps
$     
</pre>
<p>
If my system had many CPUs then each process could (theoretically at least)
run on a different CPU.   Unfortunately, there is only one so again the
operating system resorts to trickery by running each process in turn
for a short period.
This period of time is known as a time-slice.
This trick is known as multi-processing or scheduling and it fools each 
process into thinking that it is the only process.  
Processes are protected from one another so that if one process crashes or malfunctions then
it will not affect any others.
The operating system achieves this by giving each process a separate address 
space which only they have access to.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2.3">2.2.3&nbsp;</A> Device drivers</H3>

<p>
Device drivers make up the major part of the Linux kernel.   Like other
parts of the operating system, they operate in a highly privileged 
environment and can cause disaster if they get things wrong.
Device drivers control the interaction between the operating system
and the hardware device that they are controlling.   For example, 
the filesystem makes use of a general block device interface when writing
blocks to an IDE disk.   The driver takes care of the details and makes
device specific things happen.
Device drivers are specific to the controller chip that they are driving
which is why, for example, you need the NCR810 SCSI driver if your system
has an NCR810 SCSI controller.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.2.4">2.2.4&nbsp;</A> The Filesystems</H3>

<p>
In Linux, as it is for Unix <sup><font size=-4><tt>T</tt>M</font></sup>&nbsp;, the separate filesystems that the system may use are
not accessed by device identifiers (such as a drive number or a drive name) but instead
they are combined into a single hierarchical tree structure that represents the 
filesystem as a single entity.
Linux adds each new filesystem into this single filesystem tree as they are mounted
onto a mount directory, for example <tt>/mnt/cdrom</tt>.
One of the most important features of Linux is its support for many different filesystems.
This makes it very flexible and well able to coexist with other operating systems.
The most popular filesystem for Linux is the <tt>EXT2</tt> filesystem and this is the
filesystem supported by most of the Linux distributions.

<p>
A filesystem gives the user a sensible view of files and directories held on the
hard disks of the system regardless of the filesystem type or the characteristics
of the underlying physical device.
Linux transparently supports many different filesystems
(for example <tt>MS-DOS</tt> and <tt>EXT2</tt>) 
and presents all of the mounted files and filesystems as one integrated virtual
filesystem.
So, in general, users and processes do not need to know what sort of filesystem that any
file is part of, they just use them.

<p>
The block device drivers hide the differences between the physical block device 
types (for example, <tt>IDE</tt> and <tt>SCSI</tt>) and, so far as each filesystem is 
concerned, the physical devices are just linear collections of blocks of data.
The block sizes may vary between devices, for example 512 bytes is common for
floppy devices whereas 1024 bytes is common for IDE devices and, again, this
is hidden from the users of the system.
An <tt>EXT2</tt> filesystem looks the same no matter what device holds it.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3">2.3&nbsp;</A> Kernel Data Structures</H2>
The operating system must keep a lot of information about the current state of the
system.
As things happen within the system these data structures must be changed to reflect
the current reality.
For example, a new process might be created when a user logs onto the system.
The kernel must create a data structure representing the new process and
link it with the data structures representing all of the other processes in the system.

<p>
Mostly these data structures exist in physical memory and are accessible only by
the kernel and its subsystems.
Data structures contain data and pointers; addresses of other data structures or the 
addresses of routines.  Taken all together, the data structures used by the Linux
kernel can look very confusing.
Every data structure has a purpose and although some are used by several kernel
subsystems, they are more simple than they appear at first sight.

<p>
Understanding the Linux kernel hinges on understanding its data structures and the
use that the various functions within the Linux kernel makes of them.
This book bases its description of the Linux kernel on its data structures.
It talks about each kernel subsystem in terms of its algorithms, its methods of getting
things done, and their usage of the kernel's data structures.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3.1">2.3.1&nbsp;</A> Linked Lists</H3>
Linux uses a number of software engineering techniques to link together its data structures.
On a lot of occasions it uses <em>linked</em> or <em>chained</em> data structures.
If each data structure describes a single instance or occurance of something, for example a process
or a network device, the kernel must be able to find all of the instances.
In a linked list a root pointer contains the address of the first data structure, or <em>element</em>,
in the list and each data structure contains a pointer to the next element in the list.
The last element's next pointer would be 0 or NULL to show that it is the end of the list.
In a <em>doubly linked</em> list each element contains both a pointer to the next element in the
list but also a pointer to the previous element in the list.
Using doubly linked lists makes it easier to add or remove elements from the middle of list although
you do need more memory accesses.
This is a typical operating system trade off: memory accesses versus CPU cycles.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3.2">2.3.2&nbsp;</A> Hash Tables</H3>
Linked lists are handy ways of tying data structures together but navigating linked lists
can be inefficient.
If you were searching for a particular element, you might easily have to look at the whole
list before you find the one that you need.
Linux uses another technique, <em>hashing</em> to get around this restriction.
A <em>hash table</em> is an <em>array</em> or <em>vector</em> of pointers.
An array, or vector, is simply a set of things coming one after another in memory.
A bookshelf could be said to be an array of books.
Arrays are accessed by an <em>index</em>, the index is an offset into the array.
Taking the bookshelf analogy a little further, you could describe each book by its position
on the shelf; you might ask for the 5th book.

<p>
A hash table is an array of pointers to data structures and its index is derived from information
in those data structures.
If you had data structures describing the population of a village then you could use a person's
age as an index.
To find a particular person's data you could use their age as an index into the population hash
table and then follow the pointer to the data structure containing the person's details.
Unfortunately many people in the village are likely to have the same age and so the hash
table pointer becomes a pointer to a chain or list of data structures each describing people
of the same age.
However, searching these shorter chains is still faster than searching all of the data
structures.

<p>
As a hash table speeds up access to commonly used data structures, Linux often uses hash tables
to implement <em>caches</em>.  
Caches are handy information that needs to be accessed quickly and are usually a subset
of the full set of information available.
Data structures are put into a cache and kept there because the kernel often
accesses them.
There is a drawback to caches in that they are more complex to use and maintain than simple
linked lists or hash tables.
If the data structure can be found in the cache (this is known as a <em>cache hit</em>, 
then all well and good. 
If it cannot then all of the relevant data structures must be searched and, if the
data structure exists at all, it must be added into the cache.
In adding new data structures into the cache an old cache entry may need discarding.
Linux must decide which one to discard, the danger being that the discarded data structure
may be the next one that Linux needs.

<p>

<H3><A NAME="tth_sEc2.3.3">2.3.3&nbsp;</A> Abstract Interfaces</H3>
The Linux kernel often abstracts its interfaces.
An interface is a collection of routines and data structures which operate in a particular
way.
For example all network device drivers have to provide certain routines in which particular
data structures are operated on.
This way there can be generic layers of code using the services (interfaces) of lower layers
of specific code.
The network layer is generic and it is supported by device specific code that conforms to a
standard interface.

<p>
Often these lower layers <em>register</em> themselves with the upper layer at boot time.
This registration usually involves adding a data structure to a linked list.
For example each filesystem built into the kernel registers itself with the kernel
at boot time or, if you are using modules, when the filesystem is first used.
You can see which filesystems have registered themselves by looking at the file <tt>/proc/filesystems</tt>.
The registration data structure often includes pointers to functions.
These are the addresses of software functions that perform particular tasks.
Again, using filesystem registration as an example, the data structure that each filesystem passes
to the Linux kernel as it registers includes the address of a filesystem specfic routine which must be
called whenever that filesystem is mounted.
