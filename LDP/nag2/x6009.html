>You will remember from <A
HREF="x-087-2-iface.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>, that the
Virtual Brewery has an Ethernet-based IP network using unregistered
network numbers that are reserved for internal use only. Packets to or
from one of these networks are not routed on the Internet; if we were
to have <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> dial into
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cowslip</SPAN
> and act as a router
for the Virtual Brewery network, hosts within the Brewery's network
could not talk to real Internet hosts directly because their packets
would be dropped silently by the first major router.</P
><P
>To work around this dilemma, we will configure <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> to act as a kind of launch pad for
accessing Internet services. To the outside world, it will present
itself as a normal SLIP-connected Internet host with a registered IP
address (probably assigned by the network provider running <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cowslip</SPAN
>). Anyone logged in to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> can use text-based programs like
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ftp</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>telnet</B
>, or even
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lynx</B
> to make use of the Internet. Anyone on the
Virtual Brewery LAN can therefore telnet and log in to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> and use the programs there. For
some applications, there may be solutions that avoid logging in
to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
>. For WWW users, for
example, we could run a so-called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>proxy server</I
> on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
>, which would relay all
requests from your users to their respective servers.</P
><P
> Having to log in
to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> to make use of the
Internet is a little clumsy. But apart from eliminating the paperwork
(and cost) of registering an IP network, it has the added benefit of
going along well with a firewall setup. Firewalls are dedicated
hosts used to provide limited Internet access to users on your local
network without exposing the internal hosts to network attacks from
the outside world. Simple firewall configuration is covered in more
detail in <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.html"
>Chapter 9</A
>. In <A
HREF="x-087-2-ipmasq.html"
>Chapter 11</A
>, we'll discuss a Linux feature called
&#8220;IP masquerade&#8221; that provides a powerful alternative to
proxy servers.</P
><P
>Assume that the Brewery has been assigned the IP address <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>192.168.5.74</SPAN
> for SLIP access. All you
have to do to realize that the setup discussed above is to enter this
address into your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> file, naming it
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager-slip</SPAN
>.  The procedure
for bringing up the SLIP link itself remains unchanged.</P
