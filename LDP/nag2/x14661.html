The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>m4</B
> macro processor program generates the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.df</TT
> file when it processes the macro 
configuration file provided by the local system administrator. Throughout the 
remainder of this chapter we will refer to this configuration file as the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.mc</TT
> file.</P
><P
>The configuration process is basically a matter of creating a suitable
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.mc</TT
> file that includes macros that describe
your desired configuration. The macros are expressions that the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>m4</B
> macro processor understands and expands into
the complex <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.cf</TT
> syntax. The macro expressions
are made up of the macro name (the text in capital letters at the start),
which can be likened to a function in a programming language, and some
parameters (the text within brackets) that are used in the expansion. The
parameters may be passed literally into the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.cf</TT
>
output or may be used to govern the way the macro processing occurs.</P
><P
>A <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sendmail.mc</TT
> file for a minimal configuration (UUCP or
SMTP with all nonlocal mail being relayed to a directly connected
smart host) can be as short as 10 or 15 lines, excluding comments.</P

>&#13;If you're an administator of a number of different mail hosts, you might not
want to name your configuration file <TT

Instead, it is common practice to name it after the
host&#8212;<TT

really matter as long as the output is called
<TT

configuration file for each host allows you to keep all configuration files
in the same directory and is just an administrative convenience. Let's look

The <TT

the version of the sendmail configuration in the

This is probably the most important definition. The
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OSTYPE</TT
> macro causes a file of definitions to be
included that are good defaults for your operating system. Most of the
definitions in an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>OSTYPE</TT
> macro file set the
pathnames of various configuration files, mailer program paths and
arguments, and the location of directories sendmail uses to store
messages. The standard sendmail source code release includes such
a file for Linux, which would be included by the previous
example. Some Linux distributions, notably the Debian distribution,
include their own definition file that is completely Linux-FHS
compliant. When your distribution does this, you should probably use
its definition instead of the Linux default one.</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

be one of the first definitions to appear in your
