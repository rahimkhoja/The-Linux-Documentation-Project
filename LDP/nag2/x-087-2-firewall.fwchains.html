>Most aspects of Linux are evolving to meet the increasing demands of
its users; IP firewall is no exception. The traditional IP firewall
implementation is fine for most applications, but can be clumsy and inefficient
to configure for complex environments. To solve this problem, a new method of
configuring IP firewall and related features was developed. This new method was
called &#8220;IP Firewall Chains&#8221; and was first released for general use
in the 2.2.0 Linux kernel.</P
><P
>&#13;
The IP Firewall Chains support was developed by Paul
Russell and Michael Neuling.<A

HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FN05"

Paul has documented the IP Firewall Chains software in the IPCHAINS-HOWTO.</P
><P
>IP Firewall Chains allows you to
develop classes of firewall rules to which you may then add and remove hosts
or networks. An artifact of firewall rule chaining is that it may
improve firewall performance in configurations in which there are lots of rules.</P
><P
>IP Firewall Chains are supported by the 2.2 series kernels and are also
available as a patch against the 2.0.* kernels. The HOWTO
describes where to obtain the patch and provides lots of useful hints about
how to effectively use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> configuration utility.</P

>9.7.1. Using ipchains</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
There are two ways you can use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> utility. The
first way is to make use of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm-wrapper</B
> shell
script, which is mostly a drop-in replacement for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
>
that drives the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> program in the background. If you
want to do this, then read no further. Instead, reread the previous sections
describing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
>, and substitute
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm-wrapper</B
> in its place. This will work, but there is
no guarantee that the script will be maintained, and you will not be taking
advantage of any of the advanced features that the IP Firewall Chains have to
offer.</P
><P
>The second way to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> is to learn its new syntax
and modify any existing configurations you have to use the new syntax instead
of the old. With some careful consideration, you may find you can optimize your
configuration as you convert. The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> syntax is easier
to learn than the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
>, so this is a good option.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> manipulated three rulesets for the purpose
of configuring firewalling. With IP Firewall Chains you can create arbitrary
numbers of rulesets, each linked to one another, but there are three rulesets
related to firewalling that are always present. The standard rulesets
are direct equivalents of those used with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
>, except
they have names: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>forward</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>output</TT
>.</P
><P
>Let's first look at the general syntax of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
>
command, then we'll look at how we'd use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> instead
of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipfwadm</B
> without worrying about any of the advanced
chaining features. We'll do this by revisiting our previous examples.</P

The three rulesets of the traditional IP firewall code provided a
mechanism for building firewall configurations that were fairly simple
to understand and manage for small networks with simple firewalling
requirements. When the configuration requirements are not simple, a
number of problems become apparent.  Firstly, large networks often
require much more than the small number of firewalling rules we've
seen so far; inevitably needs arise that require firewalling rules
added to cover special case scenarios. As the number of rules grows,
the performance of the firewall deterioriates as more and more tests
are conducted on each datagram and managability becomes an
issue. Secondly, it is not possible to enable and disable sets of
rules atomically; instead, you are forced to expose yourself to attack
while you are in the middle of rebuilding your ruleset.</P
><P
>The design of IP Firewall Chains helps to alleviate these problems by
allowing the network administrator to create arbitrary sets of
firwewall rules that we can link to the three inbuilt rulesets. We can
use the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-N</TT
> option of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> to
create a new chain with any name we please of eight characters or
less. (Restricting the name to lowercase letters only is probably a
good idea.) The <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-j</TT
> option configures the action to
take when a datagram matches the rule specification. The <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-j</TT
> option
specifies that if a datagram matches a rule, further testing should be
performed against a user-defined chain. We'll illustrate this with a
diagram.</P
><P
>Consider the following <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains</B
> commands:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>ipchains -P input DENY
ipchains -N tcpin
ipchains -A tcpin -s ! 172.16.0.0/16
ipchains -A tcpin -p tcp -d 172.16.0.0/16 ssh -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A tcpin -p tcp -d 172.16.0.0/16 www -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -p tcp -j tcpin
ipchains -A input -p all</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>We set the default input chain policy to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>deny</TT
>. The
second command creates a user-defined chain called
&#8220;tcpin.&#8221; The third command adds a rule to the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tcpin</TT
> chain that matches any datagram that was
sourced from outside our local network; the rule takes no action. This
rule is an accounting rule and will be discussed in more detail in
<A
HREF="x-087-2-accounting.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>. The next two rules match any
datagram that is destined for our local network and either of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ssh</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>www</TT
> ports; datagrams
matching these rules are accepted. The next rule is when the real
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>ipchains</I
> magic begins. It causes the firewall
software to check any datagram of protocol TCP against the
tcpin user-defined chain.  Lastly, we add a rule to our
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> chain that matches any datagram; this is
another accounting rule. They will produce the following Firewall Chains shown in Figure 9-4.</P

>Our <TT

with our rules. Datagram processing always beings at one of the inbuilt chains.
We'll see how our user-defined chain is called into play by following the
processing path of different types of datagrams.</P
><P
>First, let's look at what happens when a UDP datagram for one of our hosts
is received. <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.fwchains.html#X-087-2-FIREWALL.IPCHAINS.UDP"
>Figure 9-5</A

flow through the rules.</P

></P
><P
><IMG
SRC="lag2_0905.jpg"></P
></DIV
><P
>The datagram is received by the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> chain and
falls through the first two rules because they match ICMP and TCP
protocols, respectively. It matches the third rule in the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> chain, but it doesn't specify a target, so
its datagram and byte counters are updated, but no other action takes
place. The datagram reaches the end of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
>
chain, meets with the default <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> chain policy,
and is denied.</P
><P
>To see our user-defined chain in operation, let's now consider what
happens when we receive a TCP datagram destined for the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ssh</TT
> port of one of our hosts. The sequence is shown
in <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.fwchains.html#X-087-2-FIREWALL.IPCHAINS.TCP.SSH"
>Figure 9-6</A
>.</P
><DIV

>Figure 9-6. The rules flow for a received TCP datagram for ssh</B
></P
><P
><IMG
SRC="lag2_0906.jpg"></P
></DIV
><P
>This time the second rule in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> chain does
match and it specifies a target of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tcpin</TT
>, our
user-defined chain.  Specifying a user-defined chain as a target
causes the datagram to be tested against the rules in that chain, so
the next rule tested is the first rule in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tcpin</TT
>
chain. The first rule matches any datagram that has a source address
outside our local network and specifies no target, so it too is an
accounting rule and testing falls through to the next rule. The second
rule in our <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tcpin</TT
> chain does match and specifies a
target of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ACCEPT</TT
>. We have arrived at target, so no
further firewall processing occurs. The datagram is accepted.</P
><P
>Finally, let's look at what happens when we reach the end of a
user-defined chain. To see this, we'll map the flow for a TCP datagram
destined for a port other than than the two we are handling
specifically, as shown in <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.fwchains.html#X-087-2-FIREWALL.IPCHAINS.TCP.OTHER"
>Figure 9-7</A

SRC="lag2_0907.jpg"></P

><P
>The user-defined chains do not have default policies. When all rules
in a user-defined chain have been tested, and none have matched, the
firewall code acts as though a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RETURN</TT
> rule were
present, so if this isn't what you want, you should ensure you supply
a rule at the end of the user-defined chain that takes whatever action
you wish. In our example, our testing returns to the rule in the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> ruleset immediately following the one that
moved us to our user-defined chain. Eventually we reach the end of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>input</TT
> chain, which does have a default policy and
our datagram is denied.</P
><P
>This example is very simple, but illustrates our point. A more practical use of
IP chains would be much more complex. A slightly more sophisticated example is
provided in the following list of commands:</P

>In this example, we've used a selection of user-defined chains both to
simplify management of our firewall configuration and improve the
efficiency of our firewall as compared to a solution involving only the
built-in chains.</P
><P
>Our example creates user-defined chains for each of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ssh</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>www</TT
> services in each
connection direction. The chain called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>wwwout</TT
> is
where we place rules for hosts that are allowed to make outgoing World
Wide Web connections, and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sshin</TT
> is where we define
rules for hosts to which we want to allow incoming ssh
connections. We've assumed that we have a requirement to allow and
deny individual hosts on our network the ability to make or receive
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ssh</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>www</TT
> connections. The
simplication occurs because the user-defined chains allow us to neatly
group the rules for the host incoming and outgoing permissions rather
than muddling them all together. The improvement in efficiency occurs
because for any particular datagram, we have reduced the average number
of tests required before a target is found. The efficiency gain
increases as we add more hosts. If we hadn't used user-defined chains,
we'd potentially have to search the whole list of rules to determine
what action to take with each and every datagram received.  Even if we
assume that each of the rules in our list matches an equal proportion
of the total number of datagrams processed, we'd still be searching
half the list on average. User-defined chains allow us to avoid
testing large numbers of rules if the datagram being tested doesn't
match the simple rule in the built-in chain that jumps to them.</P

three support scripts. The first of these we've discussed briefly
already, while the remaining two provide an easy and convenient means

The <B

scripts make building and modifying a firewall configuration much simpler.
The <B

configuration and writes a simplified form to the standard output. The
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains-restore</B
> command reads data in the output format
of the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ipchains-save</B
> command and configures the IP firewall
with these rules. The advantage of using these scripts over directly modifying
your firewall configuration script and testing the configuration is the ability
to dynamically build your configuration once and then save it. You can then
restore that configuration, modify it, and resave it as you please.</P
