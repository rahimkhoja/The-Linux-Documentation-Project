One of the most astounding facts about Usenet is that it isn't part of
any organization, nor does it have any sort of centralized network management
authority. In fact, it's part of Usenet lore that except for a technical
description, you cannot define <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>what</I
> it is; at the risk of sounding stupid, one might define Usenet as a collaboration
of separate sites that exchange Usenet news. To be a Usenet site, all you
have to do is find another Usenet site and strike an agreement with its
owners and maintainers to exchange news with you. Providing another site
with news is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>feeding</I
> it, whence another
common axiom of Usenet philosophy originates: &#8220;Get a feed, and you're
on it.&#8221;</P
><P
>&#13; 
The basic unit of Usenet news is the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>article</I
>. This is a message a user writes and
&#8220;posts&#8221; to the net. In order to enable news systems to
deal with it, it is prepended with administrative information, the
so-called article header. It is very similar to the mail header format
laid down in the Internet mail standard RFC-822, in that it consists
of several lines of text, each beginning with a field name terminated
by a colon, which is followed by the field's value.<A

>[1]</A

><P
>&#13; 
Articles are submitted to one or more <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>newsgroup</I
>. One may
consider a newsgroup a forum for articles relating to a common topic. All
newsgroups are organized in a hierarchy, with each group's name indicating
its place in the hierarchy. This often makes it easy to see what a group is
all about. For example, anybody can see from the newsgroup name that
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.os.linux.announce</SPAN
> is used for
announcements concerning a computer operating system named Linux.</P
><P
>&#13;
These articles are then exchanged between all Usenet sites that are
willing to carry news from this group.  When two sites agree to exchange
news, they are free to exchange whatever newsgroups they like, and
may even add their own local news hierarchies. For example,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> might have a news link
to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>barnyard.edu</SPAN
>, which
is a major news feed, and several links to minor sites which it feeds
news. Now Barnyard College might receive all Usenet groups, while GMU
only wants to carry a few major hierarchies like
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>sci</SPAN
>,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp</SPAN
>, or 
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>rec</SPAN
>. Some of the downstream
sites, say a UUCP site called <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>brewhq</SPAN
>,
will want to carry even fewer groups, because they don't have the network or
hardware resources. On the other hand,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>brewhq</SPAN
> might want to receive
newsgroups from the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>fj</SPAN
>
hierarchy, which GMU doesn't carry. It therefore maintains another link
with <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>gargleblaster.com</SPAN
>, which carries
all <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>fj</SPAN
> groups and feeds
them to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>brewhq</SPAN
>. The news flow is
shown in <A

>Figure 20-1</A
>.</P

>The labels on the arrows originating from
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>brewhq</SPAN
> may require some explanation,
though.  By default, it wants all locally generated news to be sent to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
>.  However, as
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> does not carry the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>fj</SPAN
> groups, there's no point in
sending it any messages from those groups. Therefore, the feed from
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>brewhq</SPAN
> to GMU is labeled
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>all,!fj</TT
>, meaning that all groups
except those below <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>fj</SPAN
> are sent to it.</P
