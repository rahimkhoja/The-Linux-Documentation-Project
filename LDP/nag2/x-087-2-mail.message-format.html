>17.1. What Is a Mail Message?</A
></H1
><P
>A mail message generally consists of a message body, which is the text
of the message, and special administrative data specifying recipients,
transport medium, etc., like what you see when you look at a physical
letter's envelope.</P
><P
> 
This administrative data falls into two categories. In the first category is
any data that is specific to the transport medium, like the address of sender
and recipient. It is therefore called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>envelope</I
>. It
may be transformed by the transport software as the message is passed along.</P
><P
> 

The second variety is any data necessary for handling the mail message, which
is not particular to any transport mechanism, such as the message's subject
line, a list of all recipients, and the date the message was sent. In many
networks, it has become standard to prepend this data to the mail message,
forming the so-called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mail header</I
>. It is offset from the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mail body</I
> by an empty
line.<A

><P
>Most mail transport software in the Unix world use a header format outlined
in RFC-822. Its original purpose was to specify a standard for use on the
ARPANET, but since it was designed to be independent from any environment, it
has been easily adapted to other networks, including many UUCP-based networks.</P
><P
>RFC-822 is only the lowest common denominator, however. More recent
standards have been conceived to cope with growing needs such as
data encryption, international character set support, and MIME


(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, described in RFC-1341 and other RFCs).</P
><P
>In all these standards, the header consists of several lines separated
by an end-of-line sequence. A line is made up of a field name, beginning in
column one, and the field itself, offset by a colon and white space. The
format and semantics of each field vary depending on the field name. A
header field can be continued across a newline if the next line begins
with a whitespace character such as tab. Fields can appear in any order.</P

>A typical mail header may look like this:

>Usually, all necessary header fields are generated by the mailer interface you
use, like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>elm</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pine</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mush</B
>, or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mailx</B
>. However, some are
optional and may be added by the user. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>elm</B
>, for example,
allows you to edit part of the message header. Others are added by the mail
transport software. If you look into a local mailbox file, you may see each
mail message preceded by a &#8220;From&#8221; line (note: no colon). This is
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> an RFC-822 header; it has been inserted by your mail
software as a convenience to programs reading the mailbox. To avoid potential
trouble with lines in the message body that also begin with
&#8220;From,&#8221; it has become standard procedure to escape any such
occurrence by preceding it with a &#62; character.</P

not appear in the header of the mail messages delivered to any
