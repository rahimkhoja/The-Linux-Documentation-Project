>21.5. Article Batching</A
></H1
><P
>&#13;



News batches follow a particular format that is the same for
B News, C News, and INN. Each article is preceded by a line like this:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>#! rnews <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>count</I
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>count</I
></TT
> is the number of bytes in the article. When
you use batch compression, the resulting file is compressed as a whole and
preceded by another line, indicated by the message to be used for unpacking.
The standard compression tool is
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>compress</SPAN
>, which is marked by:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>#! cunbatch</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Sometimes, when the news server sends batches via mail software that
removes the eighth bit from all data, a compressed batch may be
protected using what is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>c7-encoding</I
>; these
batches will be marked by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>c7unbatch</B
>.</P
><P
>When a batch is fed to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
> on the remote site, it
checks for these markers and processes the batch appropriately.  Some
sites also use other compression tools, like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gzip</B
>,
and precede their gzipped files with the word
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>zunbatch</B
> instead. C News does not recognize
nonstandard headers like these; you have to modify the source to
support them.</P
><P
>&#13;
In C News, article batching is performed by
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/news/batch/sendbatches</TT
>,
which takes a list of articles from the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>site/togo</TT
> file
and puts them into several newsbatches.  It should be executed once per hour,
or even more frequently, depending on the volume of traffic. Its operation
is controlled by the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>batchparms</TT
> file in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/lib/news</TT
>. This file describes the maximum batch
size allowed for each site, the batching and optional compression program
to be used, and the transport for delivering it to the remote site. You
may specify batching parameters on a per-site basis, as well as a set of
default parameters for sites not explicitly mentioned.</P
><P
>When installing C News, you will most likely find a
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>batchparms</TT
> file in your distribution that contains
a reasonable default entry, so there's a good chance that you won't have
to touch the file. Just in case, we describe its format. Each line consists
of six fields, separated by spaces or tabs:

<TT

><TT

><DD
><P
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>max</I
></TT
> is the maximum number of batches created and
scheduled for transfer before batching stalls for this particular site. This
is useful in case the remote site should be down for a long time,
because it prevents C News from cluttering your UUCP spool directories 
with zillions of newsbatches.</P
><P
>C News determines the number of queued batches using the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>queuelen</B
> script in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/news/</TT
>.
If you've installed C News in a prepackaged format, the script should not
need any editing, but if you choose to use a different flavor of spool
directories, for example, Taylor UUCP, you might have to write your
own. If you don't care about the number of spool files (because you're the only
person using your computer and you don't write articles by the megabyte),
you may replace the script's contents by a simple <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>exit 0</B
>
statement.</P

>
file. For regular feeds, this is usually <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>batcher</B
>. For
other purposes, alternative batchers may be provided. For instance, the
ihave/sendme protocol requires the article list to be turned into 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>ihave</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>sendme</I
> control messages, 
which are posted to the newsgroup
<SPAN

<B

 Alternatively, suppose you create a muncher that uses
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>gzipcun</B

have to write it yourself&#8201;).  You have to make sure that
<B

recognize files compressed with <B

><P
>If the remote site does not have an <B

you may specify <B

>The last field, <TT

transport to be used. A number of standard commands for different
transports are available; their names begin with
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

CLASS="COMMAND"

> passes them
the destination sitename on the command line. If the

CLASS="COMMAND"

derives the sitename from the <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>site</I

stripping it of anything after and including the first dot or
slash. If the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

names in <TT

><P
>&#13;When invoked without arguments, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendbatches</B
> handles all
batch queues. The interpretation of &#8220;all&#8221; depends on the presence
of a default entry in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>batchparms</TT
>. If one is found, all
directories in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/news/out.going</TT
> are checked;
otherwise, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendbatches</B
> cycles through all entries in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>batchparms</TT
>, processing just the sites found there.
Note that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendbatches</B
>, when scanning the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>out.going</TT
> directory, takes only those directories
that contain no dots or at signs (<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>@</SPAN
>)
as sitenames.</P
><P
>&#13;

There are two commands that use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uux</B
> to execute
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
> on the remote system:
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>viauux</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>viauuxz</B
>. The latter
sets the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;z</TT
> flag for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uux</B
> to
keep older versions from returning success messages for each article
delivered. Another command, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>viamail</B
>, sends article
batches to the user <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>rnews</SPAN
> on
the remote system via mail.  Of course, this requires that the remote
system somehow feeds all mail for <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>rnews</SPAN
> to its local news system.  For a
complete list of these transports, refer to the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>newsbatch</TT
> manual page.</P
><P
>All commands from the last three fields must be located in either
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>out.going/site</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/news/batch</TT
>. Most of them are scripts; you 
can easily tailor new tools for your personal needs. They are
invoked through pipes. The list of articles is fed to the batcher on standard
input, which produces the batch on standard output. This is piped into the
muncher, and so on.</P
