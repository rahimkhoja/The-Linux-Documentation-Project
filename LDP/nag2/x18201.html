><P
>&#13;INN's core program is the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> daemon.
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd&#8201;</B
>'s task is to handle all incoming articles,
storing them locally, and to pass them on to any outgoing newsfeeds if
required.  It is started at boot time and runs continually as a background
process. Running as a daemon improves performance because it has to read 
its status files only once when starting. Depending
on the volume of your news feed, certain files such as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> (which contain a list of all recently
processed articles) may range from a few megabytes to tens of megabytes.</P
><P
>Another important feature of INN is that there is always only one
instance of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> running at any time. This is also very 
beneficial to performance, because the daemon can process all articles
without having to worry about synchronizing its internal states with
other copies of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> rummaging around the news spool at
the same time. However, this choice affects the overall design
of the news system. Because it is so important that incoming news is
processed as quickly as possible, it is unacceptable that the server be
tied up with such mundane tasks as serving newsreaders accessing the news
spool via NNTP, or decompressing newsbatches arriving via UUCP. Therefore,
these tasks have been broken out of the main server and implemented in separate support programs.

>Figure 23-1</A
> attempts to illustrate the
relationships between <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
>, the other local tasks, and
remote news servers and newsreaders.</P
><P
>&#13;


Today, NNTP is the most common means of transporting news articles around,
and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> doesn't directly support anything else.
This means that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> listens on a TCP socket (port 119)
for connections and accepts news articles using the &#8220;ihave&#8221;
protocol.</P
><P
>Articles arriving by transports other than NNTP are supported indirectly
by having another process accept the articles and forward them to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> via NNTP. Newsbatches coming in over a UUCP link,
for instance, are traditionally handled by the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
>
program. INN's <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rnews</B
> decompresses the batch if necessary,
and breaks it up into individual articles; it then offers them to
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> one by one.</P
><P
>Newsreaders can deliver news when a user
posts an article. Since the handling of newsreaders deserves special 
attention, we will come back to this a little later.</P

>When receiving an article, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> first looks up its
message ID in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file. Duplicate
articles are dropped and the occurrences are optionally logged. The
same goes for articles that are too old or lack some required header
field, such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Subject:</TT
>.<A
NAME="AEN18242"
HREF="#FTN.AEN18242"
>[1]</A
> If <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> finds
that the article is acceptable, it looks at the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Newsgroups:</TT
> header line to find out what groups it
has been posted to. If one or more of these groups are found in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>active</TT
> file, the article is filed to
disk. Otherwise, it is filed to the special group <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>junk</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Individual articles are kept below <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/news</TT
>, also
called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>news spool</I
>. Each newsgroup has a
separate directory, in which each article is stored in a separate file. The
file names are consecutive numbers, so that an article in
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.risks</SPAN
> may be filed
as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>comp/risks/217</TT
>, for instance. When
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> finds that the directory it wants to store the
article in does not exist, it creates it automatically.</P
><P
>&#13;Apart from storing articles locally, you may also want to pass them on to
outgoing feeds. This is governed by the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>newsfeeds</TT
> file
that lists all downstream sites along with the newsgroups that should be fed
to them.</P
><P
>Just like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd&#8201;</B
>'s receiving end, the
processing of outgoing news is handled by a single interface, too.
Instead of doing all the transport-specific handling itself,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> relies on various backends to manage the
transmission of articles to other news servers.  Outgoing facilities
are collectively dubbed <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>channels</I
>.  Depending on
its purpose, a channel can have different attributes that determine
exactly what information <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> passes on to it.</P
><P
>&#13;For an outgoing NNTP feed, for instance, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
> might
fork the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innxmit</B
> program at startup, and, for each
article that should be sent across that feed, pass its message ID,
size, and filename to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innxmit</B
>&#8201;'s standard input. For
an outgoing UUCP feed, on the other hand, it might write the article's
size and file name to a special logfile, which is head by a different
process at regular intervals in order to create batches and queue them
to the UUCP subsystem.</P
><P
>Besides these two examples, there are other types of channels that are
not strictly outgoing feeds. These are used, for instance, when
archiving certain newsgroups, or when generating overview
information. Overview information is intended to help newsreaders
thread articles more efficiently.  Old-style newsreaders had to scan
all articles separately in order to obtain the header information
required for threading. This would put an immense strain on the server
machine, especially when using NNTP; furthermore, it was very
slow.<A
NAME="AEN18271"
HREF="#FTN.AEN18271"
>[2]</A
> The
overview mechanism alleviates this problem by prerecording all
relevant headers in a separate file (called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.overview</TT
>) for each newsgroup. This information
can then be picked up by newsreaders either by reading it directly
from the spool directory, or by using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>XOVER</B
>
command when connected via NNTP. INN has the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>innd</B
>
daemon feed all articles to the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>overchan</B
> command,
which is attached to the daemon through a channel. We'll see how this
is done when we discuss configuring news feeds later.&#13;</P
