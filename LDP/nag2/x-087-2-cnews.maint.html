Despite the complexity of C News, a news administrator's life can be fairly
easy; C News provides you with a wide variety of maintenance tools.
Some of these are intended to be run regularly from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron</B
>,
like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>newsdaily</B
>.  Using these scripts greatly reduces
daily care and feeding requirements of your C News installation.</P
><P
>Unless stated otherwise, these commands are located in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/news/maint</TT
>.  (Note that you must become user
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN
> before invoking these commands.
Running them as a superuser may render critical newsfiles inaccessible to C News.):</P

CLASS="COMMAND"
>newsdaily</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>The name already says it: run this once a day.  It is an important script
that helps you keep log files small, retaining copies of each from the last
three runs.  It also tries to sense anomalies, like stale batches in the
incoming and outgoing directories, postings to unknown or moderated newsgroups,
etc. Resulting error messages are mailed to the newsmaster.</P
></DD
><DT
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>newswatch</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>This script should be run regularly to look for anomalies in the
news system, once an hour or so. It is intended to detect problems that will
have an immediate effect on the operability of your news system, in which case it mails a trouble report to the newsmaster. Things checked include stale lock files
that don't get removed, unattended input batches, and disk space shortage.</P

CLASS="COMMAND"
>addgroup</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>This script adds a group to your site locally. The proper invocation is:

><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>addgroup <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"

></TT
></PRE
></TD

>The second argument has the same meaning as the flag in the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>active</TT
> file, meaning that anyone may post to the group
(<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>y</SPAN
>), that no one may post
(<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>n</SPAN
>), that it is moderated
(<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>m</SPAN
>), or that it is an alias for another
group (<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>=</SPAN
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>realgroup</I
></TT
>).  You might also want to use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>addgroup</B
> when the 
first articles in a newly created group arrive earlier than the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>newgroup</SPAN
> control message that is
intended to create it.</P

directory. Alternatively, you might leave it to the natural course of events
(i.e., expiration) to make them go away.</P

left over when news processes were killed at shutdown, and closes and executes
any batches left over from NNTP connections that were terminated when shutting
down the system.</P
