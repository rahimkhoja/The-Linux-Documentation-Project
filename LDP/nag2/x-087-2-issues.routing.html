>When you write a letter to someone, you usually put a complete address
on the envelope specifying the country, state, and Zip Code. After you
put it in the mailbox, the post office will deliver it to its
destination: it will be sent to the country indicated, where the
national service will dispatch it to the proper state and region. The
advantage of this hierarchical scheme is obvious: wherever you
post the letter, the local postmaster knows roughly which direction to
forward the letter, but the postmaster doesn't care which way the
letter will travel once it reaches its country of destination.</P
><P
>IP networks are structured similarly. The whole Internet consists of a
number of proper networks, called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

systems</I
>. Each system performs routing between its member
hosts internally so that the task of delivering a datagram is reduced
to finding a path to the destination host's network. As soon as the
datagram is handed to <I

network, further processing is done exclusively by the network itself.</P

Therefore, IP allows you to subdivide an IP network into several
<I

><P
>&#13;
A subnet takes responsibility for delivering datagrams to a certain range
of IP addresses. It is an extension of the concept of splitting bit fields,
as in the A, B, and C classes. However, the network part is now extended 
to include some bits from the host part. The number of bits that are 
interpreted as the subnet number is given by the so-called 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>subnet mask</I
>, or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netmask</I
>. This is a
32-bit number too, which specifies the bit mask for the network part of the
IP address.</P
><P
>&#13;The campus network of Groucho Marx University is an example of such a
network. It has a class B network number of
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.0.0</SPAN
>, and its
netmask is therefore <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>255.255.0.0</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Internally, GMU's campus network consists of several smaller networks,
such various departments' LANs. So the range of IP addresses is broken
up into 254 subnets, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.1.0</SPAN
> through <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.254.0</SPAN
>. For example, the department
of Theoretical Physics has been assigned <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.12.0</SPAN
>. The campus backbone is a
network in its own right, and is given <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.1.0</SPAN
>.  These subnets share the same
IP network number, while the third octet is used to distinguish
between them. They will thus use a subnet mask of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>255.255.255.0</SPAN

It is worth noting that <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>subnetting</I
> (the technique
of generating subnets) is only an <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>internal
division</I
> of the network. Subnets are generated by the
network owner (or the administrators). Frequently, subnets are created
to reflect existing boundaries, be they physical (between two
Ethernets), administrative (between two departments), or geographical
(between two locations), and authority over each subnet is delegated
to some contact person. However, this structure affects only the
network's internal behavior, and is completely invisible to the
outside world.</P

>Subnetting is not only a benefit to the organization; it is frequently
a natural consequence of hardware boundaries. The viewpoint of a host
on a given physical network, such as an Ethernet, is a very limited
one: it can only talk to the host of the network it is on.  All other
hosts can be accessed only through special-purpose machines called
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>gateways</I
>. A gateway is a host that is connected
to two or more physical networks simultaneously and is configured to
switch packets between them.</P

>Different physical networks have to belong to different IP networks for IP to 
be able to recognize if a host is on a local network. For example, the 
network number
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.4.0</SPAN
> is reserved for hosts on
the mathematics LAN. When sending a datagram to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>quark</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN

address <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.12.4</SPAN

destination host is on a different physical network, and therefore can be
reached only through a gateway (<SPAN

><SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

distinct subnets: the Mathematics department and the campus backbone. It
accesses each through a different interface, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fddi0</TT
>, respectively.  Now, what IP address do we assign
it? Should we give it one on subnet
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.1.0</SPAN
>, or on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.4.0</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

<SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.4.1</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.4.0</SPAN
> network. A gateway must be
assigned one IP address for each network it belongs to. These addresses&#8212;along with the corresponding netmask&#8212;are tied to
the interface through which the subnet is accessed. Thus, the interface and 
address mapping for <SPAN

><P
>&#13;The process for identifying whether a particular destination address
matches a route is a mathematical operation. The process is quite
simple, but it requires an understanding of binary arithmetic and
logic: A route matches a destination if the network
address logically ANDed with the netmask precisely equals the
destination address logically ANDed with the
netmask. </P
><P
>Translation: a route matches if the
number of bits of the network address specified by the netmask
(starting from the left-most bit, the high order bit of byte one of
the address) match that same number of bits in the destination
address.</P
><P
>When the IP implementation is searching for the best route to a
destination, it may find a number of routing entries that match the
target address. For example, we know that the default route matches
every destination, but datagrams destined for locally attached
networks will match their local route, too. How does IP know which
route to use? It is here that the netmask plays an important
role. While both routes match the destination, one of the routes has a
larger netmask than the other. We previously mentioned that the
netmask was used to break up our address space into smaller
networks. The larger a netmask is, the more specifically a target
address is matched; when routing datagrams, we should always choose
the route that has the largest netmask. The default route has a
netmask of zero bits, and in the configuration presented above, the
locally attached networks have a 24-bit netmask. If a datagram matches
a locally attached network, it will be routed to the appropriate device
in preference to following the default route because the local network
route matches with a greater number of bits. The only datagrams that
will be routed via the default route are those that don't match any
other route.</P
><P
>&#13;


You can build routing tables by a variety of means. For small LANs, it
is usually most efficient to construct them by hand and feed them to
IP using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>route</B
> command at boot time (see <A
HREF="x-087-2-iface.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>). For larger networks, they are built and
adjusted at runtime by <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>routing daemons</I
>; these
daemons run on central hosts of the network and exchange routing
information to compute &#8220;optimal&#8221; routes between the member
networks.</P
><P
>&#13;




Depending on the size of the network, you'll need to use different
routing protocols. For routing inside autonomous systems (such as the
Groucho Marx campus), the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>internal routing
protocols</I
> are used. The most prominent one of these is the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Routing Information Protocol</I
> (RIP), which is
implemented by the BSD <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>routed</B
> daemon. For routing
between autonomous systems, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>external routing
protocols</I
> like <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>External Gateway
Protocol</I
> (EGP) or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Border Gateway
Protocol</I
> (BGP) have to be used; these protocols, including
RIP, have been implemented in the University of Cornell's
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
