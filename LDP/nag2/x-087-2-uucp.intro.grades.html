></H1

The concept of jobs is vital to understanding UUCP.
Every transfer that a user initiates with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucp</B
> or
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uux</B
> is called a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>job</B
>. It is made up of 
a command to be executed on a remote system, a collection of files to 
be transferred between sites, or both.</P
><P
>As an example, the following command makes UUCP copy the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>netguide.ps</TT
> to a remote host named
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>pablo</SPAN
> and execute the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lpr</B
> command on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>pablo</SPAN
>
to print the file:</P

UUCP does not generally call the remote system immediately to execute a job
(or else you could make do with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>kermit</B
>). Instead, it
temporarily stores the job description away. This is called
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>spooling</I
>. The directory tree under which jobs are stored
is therefore called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>spool directory</I
> and is generally
located in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucp</TT
>. In our example, the job
description would contain information about the remote command to be executed
(<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lpr</B
>), the user who requested the execution, and a couple
of other items. In addition to the job description, UUCP has to store the
input file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>netguide.ps</TT
>.</P
><P
>The exact location and naming of spool files may vary, depending on
some compile-time options. HDB-compatible UUCPs generally store spool
files in a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/spool/uucp</TT
> subdirectory with the name
of the remote site. When compiled for Taylor configuration, UUCP creates
subdirectories below the site-specific spool directory for different types
of spool files.</P
><P
>At regular intervals, UUCP dials up the remote system.  When a connection to
the remote machine is established, UUCP transfers the files describing the
job, plus any input files.  The incoming jobs will not be executed
immediately, but only after the connection terminates. Execution is handled 
by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uuxqt</B
>, which also takes care of forwarding any jobs that
are designated for another site.</P
><P
>&#13;

To distinguish between more and less important jobs, UUCP associates a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>grade</I
> with each job. This is a single digit ranging
from 0 through 9, A through Z, and a through z, in decreasing precedence. Mail
is customarily spooled with grade B or C, while news is spooled with grade
N. Jobs with higher grades are transferred earlier. Grades may be assigned
using the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;g</TT
> flag when invoking <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucp</B
>
or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uux</B
>.</P
><P
>You can also prohibit the transfer of jobs below a given grade at certain
times. To do this we set the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>maximum spool grade</I
>
that will be prohibited during a conversation. The maximum spool grade 
defaults to z, meaning all grades will be transferred every time. Note the 
semantic ambiguity here: a file is transferred only if it has a grade 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>equal to</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>above</I
> the maximum spool grade threshold.</P

To understand why <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> needs to know particular 
information, a quick description of how it actually connects to a remote 
system is helpful.</P
><P
> 
When you execute <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico -s <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>system</I
></TT
></B
>
from the command line, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> first has to connect
physically. The actions taken depend on the type of connection to
open. Thus, when using a telephone line, it has to find a modem and dial
out. Over TCP, it has to call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gethostbyname</TT
> to convert
the name to a network address, find out which port to open, and bind the
address to the corresponding socket.</P
><P
>&#13;
A successful connection is followed by authorization. This procedure 
generally consists of the remote system
asking for a login name and possibly a password. This exchange is commonly
called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>login chat</I
>. The authorization procedure is
performed either by the usual
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>getty/login</B
> suite,
or on TCP sockets by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> itself.  If authorization
succeeds, the remote end fires up <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
>. The local copy of
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> that initiated the connection is referred to as
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>master</I
>, and the remote copy as <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>slave</I
>.</P
><P
>&#13;

 
Next follows the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>handshake phase</I
>&#8201;: the master sends
its hostname plus several flags.  The slave checks this hostname for
permission to log in, send, and receive files, etc.  The flags describe
(among other things) the maximum grade of spool files to transfer. If
enabled, a conversation count or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>call sequence number</I
>
check takes place here. With this feature, both sites maintain a count of
successful connections, which are compared. If they do not match, the
handshake fails. This is useful to protect yourself against impostors.</P
><P
>Finally, the two <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
>s try to agree on a common
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>transfer protocol</I
>. This protocol governs the way data is
transferred, checked for consistency, and retransmitted in case of an error.
There is a need for different protocols because of the differing types of
connections supported. For example, telephone lines require a
&#8220;safe&#8221; protocol, which is pessimistic about errors, while TCP
transmission is inherently reliable and can use a more efficient protocol that
foregoes most extra error checking.</P
><P
>After the handshake is complete, the actual transmission phase begins.
Both ends turn on the selected protocol driver. At this point, the drivers
possibly perform a protocol-specific initialization sequence.</P
><P
>The master then sends all files queued for the remote system whose
spool grade is high enough. When it has finished, it informs the slave
that it is done and that the slave may now hang up. The slave now can
either agree to hang up or take over the conversation.  This is a
change of roles: now the remote system becomes master, and the local one
becomes slave. The new master now sends its files.  When done, both
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
>&#8201;s exchange termination messages and close the
connection.</P
><P
>If you need additional information on UUCP, please refer to the
source code. There is also a really antique article floating around the Net, 
written by David A. Novitz, which gives a detailed description of the UUCP
protocol.<A
