In B News, expiration needs to be performed by a program called
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>expire</B
>, which took a list of newsgroups as arguments,
along with a time specification after which articles had to be expired.
To have different hierarchies expire at different times, you had to write a
script that invoked <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>expire</B
> for each of them separately.
C News offers a more convenient solution. In a file called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>explist</TT
>, you may specify newsgroups and expiration
intervals.  A command called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>doexpire</B
> is usually run once
a day from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron</B
> and processes all groups according to this
list.</P
><P
>&#13;
Occasionally, you may want to retain articles from certain groups even
after they have been expired; for example, you might want to keep
programs posted to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.sources.unix</SPAN
>.
This is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>archiving</I
>. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>explist</TT
>
permits you to mark groups for archiving.</P
><P
>An entry in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>explist</TT
> looks like this:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>grouplist</I
></TT
> <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"

CLASS="REPLACEABLE"

>times</I
></TT

>archive</I
></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>grouplist</I
></TT
> is a comma-separated list of
newsgroups to which the entry applies. Hierarchies may be specified by
giving the group name prefix, optionally appended with <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>all</SPAN
>. For example, for an entry applying to
all groups below <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.os</SPAN
>,
enter either <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>comp.os</B
></TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>comp.os.all</B
></TT
>.</P
><P
>When <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>expiring</I
> news from a group, the name is
checked against all entries in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>explist</TT
> in the
order given. The first matching entry applies. For example, to throw
away the majority of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp</SPAN
>
after four days, except for <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.os.linux.announce</SPAN
>, which you want
to keep for a week, you simply have an entry for the latter, which
specifies a seven-day expiration period, followed by an expiration
period for <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp</SPAN
>, which
specifies four days.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>perm</I
></TT
> field details if the entry applies to
moderated, unmoderated, or any groups. It may take the values
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>m</SPAN
>,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>u</SPAN
>, or
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>x</SPAN
>, which denote moderated, unmoderated,
or any type.</P
><P
>The third field, <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>times</I
></TT
>, usually contains
only a single number. This is the number of days after which articles 
expire if they haven't been assigned an artificial expiration
date in an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Expires:</TT
> field in the article
header. Note that this is the number of days counting from its
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>arrival</I
> at your site, not the date of posting.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>times</I
></TT
> field may, however, be more
complex than that. It may be a combination of up to three numbers
separated from one another by dashes. The first denotes the number of
days that have to pass before the article is considered a candidate
for expiration, even if the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Expires:</TT
> field would
have it expire already. It is rarely useful to use a value other than
zero. The second field is the previously mentioned default number of days
after which it will be expired. The third is the number of days after
which an article will be expired unconditionally, regardless of
whether it has an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Expires:</TT
> field or not.  If only
the middle number is given, the other two take default values. These
may be specified using the special entry <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/bounds/</SPAN
>, which is described a little
later.</P
><P
>The fourth field, <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>archive</I
></TT
>, denotes whether the
newsgroup is to be archived and where.  If no archiving is intended, a dash
should be used. Otherwise, you either use a full pathname (pointing to a
directory) or an at sign (@). The at sign denotes the default archive
directory, which must then be given to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>doexpire</B
> by using
the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;a</TT
> flag on the command line.  An archive directory
should be owned by <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN
>. When
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>doexpire</B
> archives an article from say,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.sources.unix</SPAN
>, it stores it in
the directory <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp/sources/unix</SPAN
> below
the archive directory, creating it if necessary. The archive directory itself,
however, will not be created.</P
><P
>There are two special entries in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>explist</TT
> file that
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>doexpire</B
> relies on.  Instead of a list of newsgroups, they
have the keywords <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/bounds/</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/expired/</SPAN
>. The
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/bounds/</SPAN
> entry contains the default
values for the three values of the <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>times</I
></TT
> field
described previously.</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>/expired/</SPAN
> field determines how
long C News will hold onto lines in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file. 
C News will not remove a line from the history file
once the corresponding article(s) have been expired, but will hold onto it
in case a duplicate should arrive after this date. If you are fed by only
one site, you can keep this value small. Otherwise, a couple of weeks is
advisable on UUCP networks, depending on the delays you experience with
articles from these sites.</P

>Here is a sample <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>explist</TT
> file with rather tight
expiry intervals:

>&#13;Expiring presents several potential problems. One is that your newsreader
might rely on the third field of the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>active</I
> file 
described earlier, which contains the number
of the lowest article online. When expiring articles, C News does not update
this field. If you need (or want) to have this field represent the real
situation, you need to run a program called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>updatemin</B
> after
each run of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>doexpire</B
>. (In older versions of C News, a 
script called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>upact</B
> did this.)</P
><P
>&#13;C News does not expire by scanning the newsgroup's directory, but simply
checks the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file if the article is due for
expiration.<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNCN07"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNCN07"
>[1]</A
>
If your history file somehow gets out of sync, articles may be around on
your disk forever because C News has literally forgotten
them.<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNCN08"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNCN08"
>[2]</A
>
You can repair this by using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>addmissing</B
> script in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/news/maint</TT
>, which will add missing articles
to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mkhistory</B
>,
which rebuilds the entire file from scratch. Don't forget to become user
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news</SPAN
> before invoking it, or else you
will wind up with a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>history</TT
> file unreadable by
C News.
