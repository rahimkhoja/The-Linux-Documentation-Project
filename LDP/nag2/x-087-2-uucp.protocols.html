>&#13;To negotiate session control and file transfers with the remote end,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B

referred to as the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>high-level protocol</B
>. During the 
initialization phase and the hangup phase these are simply sent across as 
strings. However, during the real transfer phase, an additional low-level 
protocol that is mostly transparent to the higher levels is employed. This 
protocol offers some added benefits, such as allowing error checks on data 
sent over unreliable links.</P

>&#13;UUCP is used over different types of connections, such as serial lines, TCP, 
or sometimes even X.25; it is advantageous to transport UUCP within
protocols designed specifically for the underlying network protocol. In
addition, several implementations of UUCP have introduced different
protocols that do roughly the same thing.</P
><P
>Protocols can be divided into two categories: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>streaming</B
> 
and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>packet</B
> protocols. Protocols of the streaming variety 
transfer a file as a whole, possibly computing a checksum over it. This is 
nearly free of overhead, but requires a reliable connection because any 
error will cause the whole file to be retransmitted. These protocols are 
commonly used over TCP connections but are not suitable for use over 
telephone lines. Although modern modems do quite a good job at error 
correction, they are not perfect, nor is there any error detection between 
your computer and the modem.</P
><P
>On the other hand, packet-oriented protocols split up the file into
several chunks of equal size. Each packet is sent and received
separately, a checksum is computed, and an acknowledgment is returned
to the sender. To make this more efficient, sliding-window protocols
have been invented, which allow for a limited number (a window) of
outstanding acknowledgments at any time. This greatly reduces the
amount of time <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uucico</B
> has to wait during a
transmission. Still, the relatively large overhead compared to a
streaming protocol makes packet protocols inefficient for TCP use, but
ideal for telephone lines.</P
><P
>The width of the data path also makes a difference. Sometimes sending 8-bit
characters over a serial connection is impossible; for instance, the
connection could go through a stupid terminal server that strips off the eighth
bit. When you transmit 8-bit characters over a 7-bit connection, they have to
be quoted on transmission. In the worst-case scenerio, quoting doubles the 
amount of data to be transmitted, although compression done by the hardware may
compensate. Lines that can transmit arbitrary 8-bit characters
are usually called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>8-bit clean</I
>. This is the case for all
TCP connections, as well as for most modem connections.</P
><P
>Taylor UUCP 1.06 supports a wide variety of UUCP protocols. The most common
of these are:

></H2
><P
>&#13;All protocols allow for some variation in packet sizes, timeouts, etc. 
Usually, the defaults work well under standard circumstances, but may
not be optimal for your situation.  The <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>g</I
> protocol, for
instance, uses window sizes from 1 to 7, and packet sizes in powers of 2
ranging from 64 through 4096. If your telephone line is usually so noisy that
it drops more than 5 percent of all packets, you should probably lower the
packet size and shrink the window. On the other hand, on very good telephone
lines the protocol overhead of sending acknowledgments for every 128 bytes may
prove wasteful, so you might increase the packet size to 512 or even 1,024.
Most binaries included in Linux distributions default to a window size of 7
and 128-byte packets.</P

>Taylor UUCP lets you tune parameters with the 
<B

>Based on the type of port used (modem, TCP, or direct),

<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>g</I

this default list with the <B

in a system entry as well as a port entry. For instance, you might
edit the <TT
