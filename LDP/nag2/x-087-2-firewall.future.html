>While developing IP Firewall Chains, Paul Russell decided that IP firewalling
should be less difficult; he soon set about the task of simplifying aspects of
datagram processing in the kernel firewalling code and produced a filtering
framework that was both much cleaner and much more flexible. He called
this new framework <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
>.</P

you'll forgive any errors in the description of

> or its associated configuration tools
that result from changes that occurred after preparation of this
material. We considered the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> work
important enough to justify the inclusion of this material, despite
parts of it being speculative in nature. If you're in any doubt, the
relevant HOWTO documents will contain the most accurate and up-to-date
information on the detailed issues associated with the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> configuration.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE

><P
>So what was wrong with IP chains? They vastly improved the efficiency
and management of firewall rules. But the way they processed datagrams
was still complex, especially in conjunction with firewall-related
features like IP masquerade (discussed in <A
HREF="x-087-2-ipmasq.html"
>Chapter 11</A
>) and other forms of address
translation. Part of this complexity existed because IP masquerade and
Network Address Translation were developed independently of the IP
firewalling code and integrated later, rather than having been
designed as a true part of the firewall code from the start. If a
developer wanted to add yet more features in the datagram processing
sequence, he would have had difficulty finding a place to insert the
code and would have been forced to make changes in the kernel in order
to do so.</P
><P
>Still, there were other problems. In particular, the
&#8220;input&#8221; chain described input to the IP networking layer
as a whole. The input chain affected both datagrams to be
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>destined for</I
> this host and datagrams to be
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>routed by</I
> this host. This was somewhat
counterintuitive because it confused the function of the input chain
with that of the forward chain, which applied only to datagrams to be
forwarded, but which always followed the input chain. If you wanted to
treat datagrams for this host differently from datagrams to be
forwarded, it was necessary to build complex rules that excluded one
or the other. The same problem applied to the output chain.</P
><P
>Inevitably some of this complexity spilled over into the system
administrator's job because it was reflected in the way that rulesets
had to be designed.  Moreover, any extensions to filtering required
direct modifications to the kernel, because all filtering policies
were implemented there and there was no way of providing a transparent
interface into it. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> addresses both the
complexity and the rigidity of older solutions by implementing a
generic framework in the kernel that streamlines the way datagrams are
processed and provides a capability to extend filtering policy without
having to modify the kernel.</P
><P
>&#13;Let's take a look at two of the key changes made.  <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.future.html#X-087-2-FIREWALL.ROUTING.IPCHAINS"
>Figure 9-8</A
> illustrates how datagrams
are processed in the IP chains implementation, while <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.future.html#X-087-2-FIREWALL.ROUTING.NETFILTER"
>Figure 9-9</A
> illustrates how they are
processed in the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> implementation. The
key differences are the removal of the masquerading function from the
core code and a change in the locations of the input and output
chains. To accompany these changes, a new and extensible configuration
tool called <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>iptables</B
> was created.</P
><P
>In IP chains, the input chain applies to all datagrams received by the
host, irrespective of whether they are destined for the local host or routed to some other host. In <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
>,
the input chain applies <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>only</I
> to datagrams
destined for the local host, and the forward chain applies only to
datagrams destined for <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>another</I
> host. Similarly,
in IP chains, the output chain applies to all datagrams leaving the
local host, irrespective of whether the datagram is generated on the
local host or routed from some other host. In
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
>, the output chain applies
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>only</I
> to datagrams generated on this host and does
not apply to datagrams being routed from another host. This change
alone offers a huge simplification of many firewall configurations.</P

>In <A
HREF="x-087-2-firewall.future.html#X-087-2-FIREWALL.ROUTING.IPCHAINS"
>Figure 9-8</A
>, the components
labeled &#8220;demasq&#8221; and &#8220;masq&#8221; are separate
kernel components responsible for the incoming and outgoing processing
of masqueraded datagrams.  These have been reimplemented as
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> modules.</P
><P
>Consider the case of a configuration for which the default policy for each
of the input, forward, and output chains is
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>deny</TT
>. In IP chains, six rules would
be needed to allow any session through a firewall host: two each in
the input, forward, and output chains (one would cover each forward
path and one would cover each return path). You can imagine how this
could easily become extremely complex and difficult to manage when you
want to mix sessions that could be routed and sessions that could
connect to the local host without being routed. IP chains allow
you to create chains that would simplify this task a little, but the
design isn't obvious and requires a certain level of expertise.</P
><P
>In the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>netfilter</I
> implementation with
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>iptables</B
>, this complexity disappears
completely. For a service to be routed across the firewall host, but
not terminate on the local host, only two rules are required: one
each for the forward and the reverse directions in the forward
chain. This is the obvious way to design firewalling rules, and will
serve to simplify the design of firewall configurations immensely.</P
