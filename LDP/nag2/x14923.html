Arguably the most powerful feature of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> is the
rewrite rule. Rewrite rules are used by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> to
determine how to process a received mail message. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
>
passes the addresses from the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>headers</I
> of a mail message
through collections of rewrite rules called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>rulesets</I
> The
rewrite rules transform a mail address from one form to another and you can
think of them as being similar to a command in your editor that replaces all
text matching a specified pattern with another.</P
><P
>Each rule has a lefthand side and a righthand side, separated by at least
one tab character. When <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>sendmail</B
> is processing mail it
scans through the rewriting rules looking for a match on the lefthand side.
If an address matches the lefthand side of a rewrite rule, the address is
replaced by the righthand side and processed again.</P

In the lefthand side of a rewriting rule, you specify a pattern that will
match an address you wish to transform. Most characters are matched literally,
but there are a number of characters that have special meaning; these are
described in the following list. The rewrite rules 
for the lefthand side are:</P

to include spaces in a token, nor is it necessary, as the expression
patterns are flexible enough to work around this need. When a rule

expression will be assigned to special variables that we'll use in the
righthand side. The only exception to this is the
<TT

never generate text to be used on the righthand side.</P

Each of the <B

perform a different task in mail processing. When you are writing
rules, it is important to understand what each of the rulesets are
expected to do.  We'll look at each of the rulesets that the
