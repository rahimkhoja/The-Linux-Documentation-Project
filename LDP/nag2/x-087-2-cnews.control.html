>&#13; 
The Usenet news protocol knows a special category of articles that
evoke certain responses or actions by the news system. These are called
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>control</I
> messages. They are recognized by the presence of a
<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>Control:</I
></TT
> field in the article header, which contains the
name of the control operation to be performed. There are several types of them,
all of which are handled by shell scripts located in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib/news/ctl</TT
>.</P
><P
>Most of these messages perform their action automatically at the time the article
is processed by C News without notifying the newsmaster. By default, only
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>checkgroups</SPAN
> messages will be handed
to the newsmaster, but you may change this by editing the scripts.</P

NAME="X-087-2-CNEWS.CONTROL.CANCEL"
>21.8.1. The cancel Message</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
The most widely known message is <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cancel</SPAN
>, with which a user can cancel an
article sent earlier. This effectively removes the article from the
spool directories, if it exists. The <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cancel</SPAN
> message is forwarded to all sites
that receive news from the groups affected, regardless of whether the
article has been seen already. This takes into account the possibility
that the original article has been delayed over the cancellation
message. Some news systems allow users to cancel other people's
messages; this is, of course, a definite no-no.</P

>&#13;


 
 
Two messages dealing with creation or removal of newsgroups are the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>newgroup</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>rmgroup</SPAN
> messages. Newsgroups below the
&#8220;usual&#8221; hierarchies may be created only after a discussion and
voting has been held among Usenet readers. The rules applying to the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>alt</SPAN
> hierarchy allow for something
close to anarchy. For more information, see the regular postings in
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news.announce.newusers</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>news.announce.newgroups</SPAN
>.  Never send
a <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>newgroup</SPAN
> or
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>rmgroup</SPAN
> message yourself unless you
definitely know that you are allowed to.</P

>21.8.3. The checkgroups Message</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>checkgroups</SPAN
> messages are sent by news
administrators to make all sites within a network synchronize their
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>active</TT
> files with the realities of Usenet. For example,
commercial Internet Service Providers might send out such a message to their
customers' sites.  Once a month, the &#8220;official&#8221;
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>checkgroups</SPAN
> message for the major
hierarchies is posted to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>comp.announce.newgroups</SPAN
> by its
moderator. However, it is posted as an ordinary article, not as a control
message. To perform the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>checkgroups</SPAN
>
operation, save this article to a file, say <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/tmp/check</TT
>,
remove everything up to the beginning of the control message itself, and feed
it to the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>checkgroups</SPAN
> script using the
following command:

>This will update your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

listed in <TT

>localgroups</TT
>. The old
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>newsgroups</TT
> file will be moved to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>newsgroups.bac</TT
>. Note that posting the message locally 
rarely works, because <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>inews</B
>, the command that accepts 
and posts articles from users, refuses to accept that large an article.</P

>If C News finds mismatches between the

would bring your site up to date and mails it to the news administrator. </P

From: news (News Subsystem)
To: usenet
Subject: Problems with your active file
The following newsgroups are not valid and should be removed.
        alt.ascii-art
        bionet.molbio.gene-org
        comp.windows.x.intrisics
        de.answers
You can do this by executing the commands:
         /usr/lib/news/maint/delgroup alt.ascii-art
         /usr/lib/news/maint/delgroup bionet.molbio.gene-org
         /usr/lib/news/maint/delgroup comp.windows.x.intrisics
         /usr/lib/news/maint/delgroup de.answers
The following newsgroups were missing.
        comp.binaries.cbm
        comp.databases.rdb
        comp.os.geos
        comp.os.qnx
        comp.unix.user-friendly

>When you receive a message like this from your news system, don't
believe it automatically. Depending on who sent the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>checkgroups</SPAN
> message, it may lack a few
groups or even entire hierarchies; you should be careful about removing
any groups. If you find groups are listed as missing that you want to carry
at your site, you have to add them using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>addgroup</B
>
script. Save the list of missing groups to a file and feed it to the
following little script:

version string and the output of <B

respectively. C News is very laconic about <SPAN
