><P
>Dialup IP servers frequently offer SLIP service through special user
accounts. After logging in to such an account, you are not dropped into
the common shell; instead, a program or shell script is executed that
enables the server's SLIP driver for the serial line and configures the
appropriate network interface. Then you have to do the same at your end
of the link.</P
><P
>On some operating systems, the SLIP driver is a user-space program;
under Linux, it is part of the kernel, which makes it a lot faster.
This speed requires, however, that the serial line be converted to the
SLIP mode explicitly. This conversion is done by means of a special
tty line discipline, SLIPDISC. While the tty is in normal line
discipline (DISC0), it exchanges data only with user processes, using
the normal <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>read(2)</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write(2)</TT
> calls, and the SLIP driver is unable to
write to or read from the tty. In SLIPDISC, the roles are reversed:
now any user-space processes are blocked from writing to or reading
from the tty, while all data coming in on the serial port is passed
directly to the SLIP driver.</P
><P
>   The SLIP driver itself
understands a number of variations on the SLIP protocol. Apart from
ordinary SLIP, it also understands CSLIP, which performs the so-called
Van Jacobson header compression (described in RFC-1144) on outgoing IP
packets. This compression improves throughput for interactive sessions
noticeably. There are also six-bit versions for each of these
protocols.</P
><P
>&#13;A simple way to convert a serial line to SLIP mode is by using the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slattach</B
> tool. Assume you have your modem on
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/ttyS3</TT
> and have logged in to the SLIP server
successfully. You will then execute:

><P
>This tool switches the line discipline of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ttyS3</TT
> to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SLIPDISC</TT
> and attaches it to one of the SLIP network
interfaces. If this is your first active SLIP link, the line will be attached
to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sl0</TT
>&#8201;; the second will be attached to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sl1</TT
>, and so on. The current kernels support a default
maximum of 256 simultaneous SLIP links.</P
><P
>&#13;The default line discipline chosen by <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slattach</B
> is CSLIP.
You may choose any other discipline using the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>&#8211;p</TT
> switch.
To use normal SLIP (no compression), you use:

is available called <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>adaptive</TT

kernel to automatically detect which type of SLIP encapsulation is
being used by the remote end.</P

>Note that you must use the same encapsulation as your peer. For
example, if <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

CSLIP, you also have to do so. If your SLIP connection doesn't work,
the first thing you should do is ensure that both ends of the link
agree on whether to use header compression or not. If you are unsure
what the remote end is using, try configuring your host for adaptive
slip. The kernel might figure out the right type for you.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slattach</B
> lets you enable not only SLIP, but other
protocols that use the serial line, like PPP or KISS (another
protocol used by ham radio people). Doing this is not common, though, and there are
better tools available to support these protocols. For details, please refer
to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

> manual page.</P

>After turning over the line to the SLIP driver, you must configure the
network interface. Again, you do this using the standard
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifconfig</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>route</B
>
commands. Assume that we have dialed up a server named <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cowslip</SPAN
> from <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
>. On <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>vlager</I

add the route to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cowslip</SPAN
> and the
default route, using <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cowslip</SPAN
> as a
gateway.</P
><P
>Two things are worth noting about the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ifconfig</B
>
invocation: The <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>pointopoint</SPAN
>
option that specifies the address of the remote end of a
point-to-point link and our use of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager-slip</SPAN
> as the address of the local
SLIP interface.</P
><P
>We have mentioned that you can use the same address you assigned to
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
>'s Ethernet interface
for your SLIP link, as well. In this case, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager-slip</SPAN
> might just be another alias
for address <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>172.16.1.1</SPAN
>.
However, it is also possible that you have to use an entirely
different address for your SLIP link. One such case is when your
network uses an unregistered IP network address, as the Brewery
does. We will return to this scenario in greater detail in the next
section.</P
><P
>For the remainder of this chapter we will always use
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager-slip</SPAN
> to refer to the address
of the local SLIP interface.</P
><P
>When taking down the SLIP link, you should first remove all routes
through <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>cowslip</SPAN
> using
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>route</B
> with the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>del</TT
> option, then
take the interface down, and send <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>slattach</B
> the
hangup signal. The you must hang up the modem using your
terminal program again:
