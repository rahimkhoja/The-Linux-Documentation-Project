>The Virtual Brewery grows and opens a branch in another city. The
subsidiary runs an Ethernet of its own using the IP network number
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>172.16.3.0</SPAN
>, which is subnet 3 of the
Brewery's class B network. The host
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vlager</SPAN
> acts as the gateway for the
Brewery network and will support the PPP link; its peer at the new branch is
called <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>vbourbon</SPAN
> and has an IP address
of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>172.16.3.1</SPAN
>. This network is
illustrated in <A
