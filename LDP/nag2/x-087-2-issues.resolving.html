>2.6. Resolving Host Names</A
></H1
><P
>As described previously, addressing in TCP/IP networking, at least for
IP Version 4, revolves around 32-bit numbers. However, you will have a
hard time remembering more than a few of these numbers. Therefore,
hosts are generally known by &#8220;ordinary&#8221; names such as
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>gauss</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>strange</SPAN
>. It becomes the application's
duty to find the IP address corresponding to this name.  This process
is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>hostname resolution</I
>.</P
><P
>When an application needs to find the IP address of a given host, it
relies on the library functions <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gethostbyname(3)</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>gethostbyaddr(3)</TT
>. Traditionally, these and a
number of related procedures were grouped in a separate library called
the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>resolverlibrary</I
>&#8201;; on Linux, these functions
are part of the standard <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libc</TT
>. Colloquially, this
collection of functions is therefore referred to as &#8220;the
resolver.&#8221; Resolver name configuration is detailed in <A
HREF="x-087-2-resolv.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>.</P
><P
>On a small network like an Ethernet or even a cluster of Ethernets, it
is not very difficult to maintain tables mapping hostnames to
addresses. This information is usually kept in a file named
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
>. When adding or removing hosts, or
reassigning addresses, all you have to do is update the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hosts</TT
> file on all hosts. Obviously, this will
become burdensome with networks that comprise more than a handful of
machines.</P
><P
>One solution to this problem is the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Network Information
System</I
> (NIS), developed by Sun Microsystems, colloquially 
called YP or Yellow Pages. NIS stores the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hosts</TT
>
file (and other information) in a database on a master host from which clients
may retrieve it as needed. Still, this approach is suitable only for
medium-sized networks such as LANs, because it involves maintaining
the entire <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hosts</TT
> database centrally and distributing
it to all servers. NIS installation and configuration is discussed in
detail in <A
HREF="x-087-2-nis.html"
>Chapter 13</A
>.</P
><P
>On the Internet, address information was initially stored in a single
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>HOSTS.TXT</TT
> database, too. This file was maintained at
the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Network Information Center</I
> (NIC), and had to 
be downloaded and installed by all participating sites. When the network 
grew, several problems with this scheme arose. Besides the administrative 
overhead involved in installing <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>HOSTS.TXT</TT
> regularly, 
the load on the servers that distributed it became too high. Even more 
severe, all names had to be registered with the NIC, which made sure that 
no name was issued twice.</P
><P
>This is why a new name resolution scheme was adopted in 1994: the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Domain Name System</I
>. DNS was designed by Paul
Mockapetris and addresses both problems simultaneously. We discuss the
Domain Name System in detail in <A
