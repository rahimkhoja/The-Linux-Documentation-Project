>DNS organizes hostnames in a domain hierarchy. A
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>domain</I
> is a collection of sites that are related
in some sense&#8212;because they form a proper network (e.g.,
all machines on a campus, or all hosts on BITNET), because they all
belong to a certain organization (e.g., the U.S. government), or
because they're simply geographically close. For instance,
universities are commonly grouped in the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>edu</SPAN
> domain, with each university or
college using a separate <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>subdomain</I
>, below which
their hosts are subsumed. Groucho Marx University have the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> domain, while the
LAN of the Mathematics department is assigned <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>maths.groucho.edu</SPAN
>. Hosts on the
departmental network would have this domain name tacked onto their
hostname, so <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
> would be
known as <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos.maths.groucho.edu</SPAN
>.  This is called
the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>fully qualified domain name</I
> (FQDN), which
uniquely identifies this host worldwide.</P

HREF="x-087-2-resolv.howdnsworks.html#X-087-2-RESOLV.FIG.DNS"
>Figure 6-1</A

The entry at the root of this tree, which is denoted by a single dot, is quite
appropriately called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>root domain</I
> and encompasses all
other domains. To indicate that a hostname is a fully qualified domain name,
rather than a name relative to some (implicit) local domain, it is
sometimes written with a trailing dot. This dot signifies that the name's
last component is the root domain.

>Historically, the first four of these were assigned to the U.S., but
recent changes in policy have meant that these domains, named global
Top Level Domains (gTLD), are now considered global in nature.
Negotiations are currently underway to broaden the range of gTLDs,
which may result in increased choice in the future.</P
><P
>Outside the U.S., each country generally uses a top-level domain of
its own named after the two-letter country code defined in ISO-3166.
Finland, for instance, uses the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>fi</SPAN
> domain; <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>fr</SPAN
> is used by France, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>de</SPAN
> by Germany, and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>au</SPAN
> by Australia. Below this top-level
domain, each country's NIC is free to organize hostnames in whatever
way they want. Australia has second-level domains similar to the
international top-level domains, named <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>com.au</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>edu.au</SPAN
>. Other countries, like Germany,
don't use this extra level, but have slightly long names that refer
directly to the organizations running a particular domain. It's not
uncommon to see hostnames like <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de</SPAN
>. Chalk
that up to German efficiency.</P
><P
>Of course, these national domains do not imply that a host below that
domain is actually located in that country; it means only that the
host has been registered with that country's NIC. A Swedish manufacturer
might have a branch in Australia and still have all its hosts
registered with the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>se</SPAN
> top-level domain.</P
><P
>Organizing the namespace in a hierarchy of domain names nicely solves
the problem of name uniqueness; with DNS, a hostname has to be unique
only within its domain to give it a name different from all other
hosts worldwide. Furthermore, fully qualified names are easy to
remember.  Taken by themselves, these are already very good reasons to
split up a large domain into several subdomains.</P
><P
>&#13;

DNS does even more for you than this. It also allows you to delegate
authority over a subdomain to its administrators.  For example, the
maintainers at the Groucho Computing Center might create a subdomain
for each department; we already encountered the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>math</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>physics</SPAN
> subdomains above. When they find
the network at the Physics department too large and chaotic to manage
from outside (after all, physicists are known to be an unruly bunch of
people), they may simply pass control of the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>physics.groucho.edu</SPAN
> domain to the
administrators of this network. These administrators are free to use
whatever hostnames they like and assign them IP addresses from their
network in whatever fashion they desire, without outside interference.</P
><P
> To this end,
the namespace is split up into <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>zones</I
>, each rooted
at a domain. Note the subtle difference between a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>zone</I
> and a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>domain</I
>: the
domain <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
>
encompasses all hosts at Groucho Marx University, while the zone
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> includes only the
hosts that are managed by the Computing Center directly; those at the
Mathematics department, for example. The hosts at the Physics
department belong to a different zone, namely <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>physics.groucho.edu</SPAN
>.  In <A
HREF="x-087-2-resolv.howdnsworks.html#X-087-2-RESOLV.FIG.DNS"
>Figure 6-1</A
>, the start of a zone is marked by a
small circle to the right of the domain name.</P

><P
>At first glance, all this domain and zone fuss seems to make name
resolution an awfully complicated business. After all, if no central
authority controls what names are assigned to which hosts, how is a
humble application supposed to know?</P
><P
>Now comes the really ingenious part about DNS. If you want to find the
IP address of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>, DNS
says, &#8220;Go ask the people who manage it, and they will tell
you.&#8221;</P
><P
> In fact, DNS is
a giant distributed database. It is implemented by so-called name
servers that supply information on a given domain or set of
domains. For each zone there are at least two, or at most a few, name
servers that hold all authoritative information on hosts in that
zone. To obtain the IP address of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>, all you have to do is contact the
name server for the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> zone, which will then return
the desired data.</P
><P
>&#13;Easier said than done, you might think. So how do I know how to reach
the name server at Groucho Marx University? In case your computer isn't
equipped with an address-resolving oracle, DNS provides for this, too.
When your application wants to look up information on
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
>, it contacts a local name
server, which conducts a so-called iterative query for it. It starts off
by sending a query to a name server for the root domain, asking for the address
of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos.maths.groucho.edu</SPAN
>. The root
name server recognizes that this name does not belong to its zone of authority,
but rather to one below the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>edu</SPAN
> domain.
Thus, it tells you to contact an <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>edu</SPAN
>
zone name server for more information and encloses a list of all
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>edu</SPAN
> name servers along with their
addresses. Your local name server will then go on and query one of those,
for instance, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>a.isi.edu</SPAN
>. In a manner
similar to the root name server,
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>a.isi.edu</SPAN
> knows that the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> people run a zone of
their own, and points you to their servers. The local name server will then
present its query for <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>erdos</SPAN
> to one
of these, which will finally recognize the name as belonging to its zone,
and return the corresponding IP address.
</P
><P
>This looks like a lot of traffic being generated for looking up a
measly IP address, but it's really only miniscule compared to the amount
of data that would have to be transferred if we were still stuck with
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>HOSTS.TXT</TT
>. There's still room for improvement with this
scheme, however.</P
><P
>To improve response time during future queries, the name server stores
the information obtained in its local <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>cache</I
>. So
the next time anyone on your local network wants to look up the
address of a host in the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> domain, your name server will
go directly to the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>groucho.edu</SPAN
> name server.<A
NAME="X-087-2-FNIS06"
HREF="#FTN.X-087-2-FNIS06"
>[1]</A
></P
><P
> Of course, the name server will not
keep this information forever; it will discard it after some time. The
expiration interval is called the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>time to live</I
>,
or TTL. Each datum in the DNS database is assigned such a TTL by
administrators of the responsible zone.</P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

referred to as <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>master name servers</I
>. Any query for a host
within this zone will end up at one of these master name servers.</P
><P
>&#13;


Master servers must be fairly well synchronized. Thus, the zone's
network administrator must make one the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>primary</I
>
server, which loads its zone information from data files, and make
the others <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>secondary</I

zone data from the primary server at regular intervals.</P
><P
>Having several name servers distributes workload; it also provides
backup. When one name server machine fails in a benign way, like
crashing or losing its network connection, all queries will fall back
to the other servers. Of course, this scheme doesn't protect you from
server malfunctions that produce wrong replies to all DNS requests,
such as from software bugs in the server program itself.</P

>We have seen that DNS not only deals with IP addresses of hosts, but
also exchanges information on name servers. DNS databases may
have, in fact, many different types of entries.</P
><P
> A
single piece of information from the DNS database is called a
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>resource record</I
> (RR). Each record has a type
associated with it describing the sort of data it represents, and a
class specifying the type of network it applies to. The latter
accommodates the needs of different addressing schemes, like


IP addresses (the IN class), Hesiod addresses (used by MIT's
Kerberos system), and a few more. The prototypical resource record
type is the A record, which associates a fully qualified domain name
with an IP address.</P
><P
>&#13;

A host may be known by more than one name. For example you might have
a server that provides both FTP and World Wide Web servers, which you
give two names: <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ftp.machine.org</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>www.machine.org</SPAN
>. However, one of these
names must be identified as the official or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>canonical</I
> hostname, while the others are simply
aliases referring to the official hostname. The difference is that the
canonical hostname is the one with an associated A record, while the
others only have a record of type CNAME that points to the canonical
hostname.</P

><P
>Finding the IP address belonging to a host is certainly the most
common use for the Domain Name System, but sometimes you'll want to
find the canonical hostname corresponding to an address. Finding this
hostname is called <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>reverse mapping</I
>, and is used
by several network services to verify a client's identity. When using
a single <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hosts</TT
> file, reverse lookups simply
involve searching the file for a host that owns the IP address in
question. With DNS, an exhaustive search of the namespace is out of
the question.  Instead, a special domain, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>in-addr.arpa</SPAN
>, has been created that
contains the IP addresses of all hosts in a reversed dotted quad
notation.  For instance, an IP address of <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.12.4</SPAN
> corresponds to the name
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>4.12.76.149.in-addr.arpa</SPAN
>. The
resource-record type linking these names to their canonical hostnames
is PTR.</P
><P
>&#13;




Creating a zone of authority usually means that its administrators
have full control over how they assign addresses to names.  Since they
usually have one or more IP networks or subnets at their hands,
there's a one-to-many mapping between DNS zones and IP networks. The
Physics department, for instance, comprises the subnets <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.8.0</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.12.0</SPAN
>, and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.14.0</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Consequently, new zones in the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>in-addr.arpa</SPAN
> domain have to be created
along with the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>physics</SPAN
> zone,
and delegated to the network administrators at the department:
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>8.76.149.in-addr.arpa</SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>12.76.149.in-addr.arpa</SPAN
>, and
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>14.76.149.in-addr.arpa</SPAN
>.
Otherwise, installing a new host at the Collider Lab would require
them to contact their parent domain to have the new address entered
into their <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>in-addr.arpa</SPAN
> zone
file.</P

>&#13;<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"

only be created as supersets of IP networks. An even more severe
restriction is that these networks' netmasks have to be on byte
boundaries. All subnets at Groucho Marx University have a netmask of
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>255.255.255.0</SPAN
>, hence an
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>in-addr.arpa</SPAN

created for each subnet. However, if the netmask were <SPAN

>255.255.255.128</SPAN
> instead, creating zones
for the subnet <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>149.76.12.128</SPAN

would be impossible, because there's no way to tell DNS that the
<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>12.76.149.in-addr.arpa</SPAN

has been split into two zones of authority, with hostnames ranging from
<SPAN

<SPAN
