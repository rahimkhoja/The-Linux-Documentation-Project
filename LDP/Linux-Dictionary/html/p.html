>&#13;A type of Interpreted language. P-code languages are something of a hybrid, falling between compiled languages and interpreted languages in the way they execute. Like an interpreted language, P-code programming is converted to a binary form automatically when it is run, rather than having to be compiled. However, unlike a compiled language the executable binary file is stored in pseudo-code, not machine language. In addition, unlike an Interpreted language, the program does not have to be converted to binary each time it is run. After it is converted to P-code the first time, the pseudo-code version is used for each additional execution. P-code languages (and thus their programs) tend to be slower than compiled languages and programs but faster than interpreted languages, and they generally have authorization to some low-level operating system functions but not direct hardware access. They do not require sometimes-expensive compilers, are often included along with operating systems, and some p-code languages are easier to program than compiled languages. Examples of Pcode languages are Java, Python and REXX/Object REXX. From I-gloss

>&#13;They are like compiled languages in that the source is translated to a compact binary form which is what you actually execute, but that form is not machine code. Instead it's pseudocode (or p-code), which is usually a lot simpler but more powerful than a real machine language. When you run the program, you interpret the p-code. Important p-code languages include Python and Java. See Compiled language and Interpreted language. From Linux Guide @FirstLinux

>&#13;Pascal to C translator P2c is a tool for translating Pascal programs into C. The input consists of a set of source files in any of the following Pascal dialects: HP Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC VAX Pascal, Oregon Software Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal, Texas Instruments Pascal, Apollo Domain Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is also supported. Output is a set of .c and .h files that comprise an equivalent program in any of several dialects of C. Output code may be kept machine and dialect-independent, or it may be targeted to a specific machine and compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are converted into fully functional C which will compile and run with no further modifications, although p2c sometimes chooses to generate readable code at the expense of absolute generality.

>&#13;All data sent across the Internet is broken up into packets, sent individually across the network, and reassembled back into the original data at the other end. Analogy: Imagine looking at an automobile freeway during rush hour from an airplane. The freeway looks like a flowing river, but each individual car (packet) is really independent from all the others. While it looks like the cars on the freeway are going in the same direction, each car really has its own source and destination separate from the others around it. This is how Internet core routes look. Analogy: Now consider that a bunch of coworkers leave the office and go to a party. Each gets in his/her own car and drives to the party. Each person may take a slightly route, but they all end up together at the party. This demonstrates how data is broken up into individual packets, sent across the Internet (potentially following different routes), then reassembled back again at the destination. Key point: Conceptually, networking occurs at abstract layers well above the concept of packets. Users type in a URL, and the file is downloaded. By dealing with the raw packets themselves, hackers are frequently able to subvert communications in ways not detectable at these higher layers. Contrast: The term "packet switched network (PSN)" is used to describe the Internet, whereas the term "circuit switched network (CSN)" is used to contrast it with the traditional phone system. The key difference is that in the phone system, the route between two people is setup at the start, and each bit in the stream follows that route. On the Internet, each packet finds its own route through the system, so during a conversation, the packets can follow different paths, and indeed arrive out-of-order. Another key difference is latency. The phone system forwards each bit one at a time, so as soon as one arrives, it doesn't have to wait before forwarding it on. On the Internet, bits are bunched together before transmission. Each hop must wait and receive all the bits before forwarding any of them on. Each hop therefore adds a significant amount of delay. Gamers know this as the "ping" time. Key point: There are other technologies that use packets, not just the Internet. Before the Internet came along, X.25 networks were a popular form of packet-based communication (and indeed, X.25 formed the basis for many links on the nascent Internet). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;packet filter
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In firewalls, packet filters are the technology most often used to control traffic. Every packet contains the following fields: source IP address (example: 192.0.2.156) destination IP address transport type (example: TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1) source port (example: HTTP=80, DNS=53, FTP=21) destination port flags (example: SYN) This data is compared against "rules" within the firewall. A typical set of rules might be: BLOCK destination=192.0.2.x TCP flag=SYNALLOW destination=192.0.2.123 TCP destport=80 ALLOW destination=192.0.2.124 TCP destport=25 If our private network is 192.0.2.x, then the first rule above blocks all incoming TCP connections (though outbound connections would still be allowed). The following rules override the first, allowing access to the web-server at port 80 and access to the e-mail server at port 25. Key point: The basic stance of a company firewall is: blocks all UDP traffic except for DNS blocks all incoming TCP connections but allows all outgoing ones allows incoming connections to public HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS servers located in a "DMZ". blocks all ICMP traffic except for those packets needed for path MTU discovery. This allow most access to the Internet for end-users and allows the Internet to access the public servers. It blocks everything else. Contrast: The word "dynamic packet filter" was coined to contrast with the normal "static filter" rules in a firewall described above. Dynamic rules are needed because: Ports are a poor way of identifying protocols (and getting poorer) Whereas most communication uses only outbound connections, some (like FTP) use multiple connections in both directions. In the case of FTP, the client creates an outbound connection to the server, then the server creates separate inbound connections in order to transfer files to the client. Static firewall rules would block this incoming connection, dynamic rules monitor the state and temporarily change the static rules just to allow that connection. An example of a "dynamic" rule is to solve the FTP problem is: Block all incoming connections, but if the user has established a connection to port 21 on a server, then allowing incoming TCP connection from the server port 20 to ports higher than 1024 on the client. Another type of "dynamic" rule is one where the firewall does protocol analysis at layers higher than TCP. To contrast with the example above, the firewall might analyze the FTP connection looking for the PORT command. (The "PORT" command is the FTP protocol whereby the client tells the server which port is has opened to receive a file on). Checkpoint calls this protocol analysis "stateful packet inspection" in their firewall. Other vendors do similar stuff, but call it different names. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;The action a device takes to selectively control the flow of data to and from a network. Packet filters allow or block packets, usually while routing them from one network to another (most often from the Internet to an internal network, and vice-versa). To accomplish packet filtering, you set up rules that specify what types of packets (those to or from a particular IP address or port) are to be allowed and what types are to be blocked.

>&#13;The method used to move data around on the Internet. In packet switching,all the data coming out of a machine is broken up into chunks, each chunk has the address of where it came from and where it is going. This enables chunks of data from many different sources to co-mingle on the same lines, and be sorted and directed along different routes by special machines along the way. This way many people can use the same lines at the same time. You might think of several caravans of trucks all using the same road system. to carry materials. From Matisse

>&#13;Padding is the process of adding unused data to the end of a message in order to make it conform to a certain length. For example, block-ciphers often work on blocks that are 64-bits (8-bytes) long. Therefore, if you have a message that is 77-bytes long, you will need to "pad" it with an extra 3-bytes to make it an even 80-bytes in size (10-blocks). Key point: Padding is a regular feature of all crypto algorithms, including hashing and encryption. Some algorithms have been broken due to poor choices for padding. Most importantly, however, the size of the message can often reveal details about its contents. For example, let's assume a protocol whereby somebody accepts something with a simple message of "yes", but when it declines, it says "no" along with a reason why it was rejected. Therefore, even though the messages are encrypted, the "yes" will be a short message but the "no" will be a long message. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Pluggable Authentication Modules. A suite of shared libraries that determine how a user will be authenticated. For example, conventionally UNIX users authenticate themselves by supplying a password at the password prompt after they have typed their name at the login prompt. In many circumstances, such as internal access to workstations, this simple form of authentication is considered sufficient. In other cases, more information is warranted. If a user wants to log in to an internal system from an external source, like the Internet, more or alternative information may be required, perhaps a one-time password. PAM provides this type of capability and much more. Most important, PAM modules allow you to configure your environment with the necessary level of security. From Linux System Security

><P
>&#13;A framework for 3D graphics production Panorama will include modeling, rendering, post-processing, animating, etc.  Functionally, it is structured as an API, composed by two dynamic libraries, and several plugins, that you can optionally load in runtime.  A simple console mode front-end for this API is included in the package, that can load a scene description in one of the supported scene languages and then outputs a single image file in any of the supported graphic formats. Its main features are:   - Plugin architecture. Most elements in the system are     plugin's. This means components are loaded as needed, and can be     substituted, added, etc without recompiling anything. This will     let third parties distribute their plugins outside the main     distribution.   - Object oriented scene description language, with classes,     inheritance, etc. It's easy to use, and has a simple syntax.   - Scene language is a plugin itself, so any other scene language     can be used instead.   - Several rendering methods are possible without any other change     in input scene file. Currently supported methods are raytracing     and zbuffer, but other methods are being tested and will be     incorporated in the future.   - A postprocessing system lets you apply filters to the whole image     after it has been generated by renderer.   - Similarly, there are object filters, that you can apply to an     object in the rendering process. This means a new class of     effects (e.g. a cartoon-like object in a photorealistic scene).   - Materials have a BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution     Function) that encapsulates its properties with respect to the     light. Now, only Lambertian and Phong BSDF's are implemented, but     more sophisticated ones will follow, like Schlick's, Ward's, etc. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A technique used to detect memory or data communication errors. The computer adds up the number of bits in a one-byte data item, and if the parity bit setting disagrees with the sum of the other bits, the computer reports an error. Parity-checking schemes work by storing a one-bit digit (0 or 1) that indicates whether the sum of the bits in a data item is odd or even. When the data item is read from memory or received by another computer, a panty check occurs. If the parity check reveals that the parity bit is incorrect, the computer displays an error message.

>&#13;The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package contains the Parted binary and manual page. Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT and PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems supported are ext2, ext3, FAT (FAT16 and FAT32) and linux-swap. Parted can also detect HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS, ReiserFS, UFS and XFS filesystems, but cannot create/remove/resize/check these filesystems yet. The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment, they could exist, so please back up all important files before running it, and do so at your own risk. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT and PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16 and FAT32) and linux-swap. Parted can also detect HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS, ReiserFS, UFS and XFS filesystems, but cannot create/remove/resize/check these filesystems yet. The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment, they could exist, so please back up all important files before running it, and do so at your own risk. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Linux/UNIX utility to save partitions in a compressed image file Partition Image is a Linux/UNIX partition imaging utility: it saves partitions in the Ext2FS  (the linux standard), ReiserFS (a new journaled and powerful file system), NTFS (Windows NT File System)  or FAT16/32 (DOS &#38; Windows file systems) file system formats to an image file. Only used blocks are copied. The image file can be compressed in the GZIP/BZIP2 formats to save disk space, and split into multiple files to be copied onto removable media (ZIP for example), burned on a CD-R, etc. This makes it possible to save a full Linux/Windows system with a single operation.  In case of a problem (virus, crash, error, etc.), you just have to restore, and after several minutes, your entire system is restored (boot, files, etc.), and fully working. This is very useful when installing the same software on many machines: just install one of them, create an image, and just restore the image on all other machines. Then, after the first one, each installation is automatic made, and requires only a few minutes. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A high-level, procedural proramming language that encourages programmers to write well-structured, modular programs that take advantage of modern control structures and lack spaghetti code. Pascal has gained wide acceptance as a teaching and application-development language, though most professional programmers prefer C or C++. Pascal is available in interpreted and compiled versions. A major disadvantage of Pascal is that (its standard version (Standard Pascal) contains many shortcomings. The language's inventor, Nicklaus Wirth, has covered a new language, Modula-2 as a successor to Pascal, that fixes some of the language's problems, and Borland International's Turbo Pascal makes Pascal easy for personal computer owners to use.

>&#13;n. An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600 around 1967-68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming. This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also bondage-and-discipline language). The hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of K&#38;R fame) entitled "Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language", which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies. It was eventually published in "Comparing and Assessing Programming Languages", edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984). Part of his discussion is worth repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after ten years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages. At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote: 9. There is no escape This last point is perhaps the most important. The language is inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its limitations. There are no casts to disable the type-checking when necessary. There is no way to replace the defective run-time environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler that defines the "standard procedures". The language is closed. People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal trap. Because the language is impotent, it must be extended. But each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look like whatever language they really want. Extensions for separate compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators, etc., all add to the utility of the language for one group but destroy its portability to others. I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond its original target. In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language, suitable for teaching but not for real programming. Pascal has since been almost entirely displaced (by C) from the niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems programming, but retains some popularity as a hobbyist language in the MS-DOS and Macintosh worlds.

>&#13;A type of authentication, a pasword is a secret word that a user must know in order to gain access. A passphrse is a correspondingly larger secret consisting of multiple words. History: Passwords have been used since Roman times. The Romans were some of the first large armies where people didn't recognize each other by site. In order to gain entry into the camp, a Roman soldier would have to know the secret password. Key point: The most important defensive mechanism that a corporation can take is to create and enforce policies about proper password usage. This policy should entail: length E.g. minimum of 6 characters composition E.g. upper and lower case, numbers, and punctuation. Note that one of the big support headaches is users who have the caps-lock key on which causes passwords to be mistyped. lifetime E.g. when passwords expire. A good choice would be every 6-months. Password expiration is an overated security technique. It's biggest benefit is that it will automatically age out. source Whether users select their own password or are given one by management. There are automated password programs that will generate easy-to-remember passwords. ownership A policy should declare that passwords should never be shared; many declare that a user will automatically lose privileges if they ever share their password with somebody else. distribution How does the user get his/her password? If the system administrator chooses the password, how do they securely tell the user? If the user chooses a password the first time they log on, how do you prevent other people from getting to the account before the legitimate user? Often people will distribute an initial password, but then force the user to change it. storage Most passwords these days are stored in an encrypted format such that even the administrators cannot know what the password is. authentication period When should the terminal automatically log the user out? Should their be a fixed time, or an inactivity timer? E.g. banking terminals automatically log the user out within a few minutes, PCs have password screen savers that can be configured. Key point: A leading cause of compromise are programs that leave behind default passwords. A leading cause of compromise are users who choose weak passwords that can easily be guessed or cracked. Tools: The crack programs can be used to maintain a strong policy (or break into systems). Tools: On Windows NT, the "passflt.dll" and "passprop.exe" tools can be used to enforce strong passwords. Misunderstanding: People used to believe that a good password was a random mix of UPPER and lower case, numbers, and punctuation. However, this generates passwords that are impossible for users to remember, so they find ways around the restriction, such as writing passwords down on Post-It notes. Therefore, somebody can compromise the network by simply looking for Post-It notes (such as pasted to the bottom of a keyboard). Controversy: Many policies declare that a password must be changed frequently, and most OSes come with tools for enforcing this. However, this leads to the same problem as above: it causes pain for users, so they behave in ways that reduce security. Also, it isn't clear that it dramatically increases security. Contrast: Passwords aren't the only authentication scheme possible. Crypto-cards are often used to generate "one-time passwords" or challenge-response authentication. Tip: Use a Palm Pilot and a crypt program to store your many passwords. Make sure that you choose a encryption program that cannot be broken. Notes: In June, 2001, the British CentralNic commissioned a poll to discover what kinds of passwords people choose. They found that people could be classified: family (50%) Chooses names, such as their own, their partner's (wife, husband, other), children, or pets. They further noted that such people tended to be those who used the computer the least. fan (30%) Chooses names of sports stars, cartoon characters, or pop sars. Since the study was in the United Kingdom, Britsh soccer player David Beckham emerged as the most popular. Variations of Homer Simpson and Madonna also were popular. self-obsessed (11%) Words like "sexy", "stud", "slapper", or "goddess". Note that in the 1995 movie Hackers, the plot centers around a high-level executive who chose "god" for a password, which the hacker easily guessed. cryptics (9%) Passwords with a mix of lower and upper case characters, numbers, and punctuation.

>&#13;A temporary copy of the password. Internal to the computer, password information is constantly being checked. If you were queried for the password each and every time, you would find that computer would become unusable. Therefore, the computer attempts to "cache" the password so that internal prompts during the same session do not cause external prompts to the user. Key point: All systems cache passwords in memory during a login session. Therefore, if a hacker can gain access to all memory on the system, he/she can likely sift the memory for passwords. Likewise, hackers can frequently sift pagefiles for passwords. Key point: Many programs whose goal is ease-of-use will ask the user if they want to save the password on disk (in a file or registry. For example, the MS Outlook e-mail client has this feature to cache the POP3 passwords. Therefore, hackers have programs that will sift the filesystem or registry or these passwords. Some systems will store these cached passwords in clear-text, others attempt to encrypt the passwords, but usually this encryption mechanism ca be defeated. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;1. n. A temporary addition to a piece of code, usually as a quick-and-dirty remedy to an existing bug or misfeature. A patch may or may not work, and may or may not eventually be incorporated permanently into the program. Distinguished from a diff or mod by the fact that a patch is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the program; the classical examples are instructions modified by using the front panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary executable of a program originally written in an HLL. Compare one-line fix. 2. vt. To insert a patch into a piece of code. 3. [in the Unix world] n. A diff (sense 2). 4. A set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching program. IBM operating systems often receive updates to the operating system in the form of absolute hexadecimal patches. If you have modified your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source. The patches might later be corrected by other patches on top of them (patches were said to "grow scar tissue"). The result was often a convoluted patch space and headaches galore. 5. [Unix] the patch(1) program, written by Larry Wall, which automatically applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code. There is a classic story of a tiger team penetrating a secure military computer that illustrates the danger inherent in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't -- or don't -- inspect and examine before installing). They couldn't find any trap doors or any way to penetrate security of IBM's OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office (remember, these were official military types who were purportedly on official business), swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake patch. The patch was actually the trapdoor they needed. The patch was distributed at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official stationery and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully installed. The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned something about proper procedures.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;The patch program applies diff files to originals.  The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file.  Diff lists the changes made to the file.  A person who has the original file can thenuse the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file). Patch should be installed because it is a common way of upgrading applications. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

>&#13;Security updates to products are often referred to as "patches" because they fix one small part of the product rather than updating the entire product. Analogy: Imagine that you are in a rubber raft that seems to be sinking. You look around on the boat and see small holes. You use your patch kit to fix the small holes rather than building yourself a new boat. Key point: The software you are using today likely has security holes that nobody has discovered yet. It seems unlikely, but this has been the historical precidence, whether you are using open-source (e.g. Linux), Microsoft products, or class UNIX systems (e.g. Sun). Therefore, if you don't keep up with the latest software, you will eventually get hacked. From Hacking-Lexicon

Though these are now obsolete as a form of addressing, they still show up in diagnostics and trace headers occasionally (e.g. in NNTP headers). 2. [Unix] A filename, fully specified relative to the root directory (as opposed to relative to the current directory; the latter is sometimes called a `relative path'). This is also called a `pathname'. 3. [Unix and MS-DOS] The `search path', an environment variable specifying the directories in which the shell (COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look for commands. Other, similar constructs abound under Unix (for example, the C preprocessor has a `search path' it uses in looking for #include files).  From Jargon Dictionary

It handles multi-volume archives and automatically determines the format of an archive while reading it.  Three user interfaces are supported: tar, cpio, and pax.  The pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best. This is the free OpenBSD's version written by Keith Muller.

It is an ideal system to use to check that a package's build-dependencies are correct, and to be sure that unnecessary and wrong build dependencies will not exist in the resulting package. It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary. "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image. "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of testing/unstable/whatever "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot image. pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

>&#13;PCI vendor ID and device ID
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;PCI supports the useful concept that every vendor and device have unique hex IDs. For instance, Intel has chosen to represent themselves by the completely random number 0x8086 as their vendor ID. PCI cards will provide their IDs on request. You will see numerical values listed in the output of lspci, scanpci, and cat /proc/pci, especially if the respective utility cannot look up the vendor name from the ID number. The file /usr/share/pci.ids ( /usr/share/misc/pci.ids on Debian) from the pciutils package contains a complete table of all IDs and their corresponding names. The kudzu package also has a table /usr/share/kudzu/pcitable containing the information we are really looking for: ID to kernel module mappings. This enables you to use the intended scientific method for locating the correct PCI module from the kernel's /proc/pci data. The file format is easy to understand, and as an exercise you should try writing a shell script to do the lookup automatically. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;PCMCIA Card Services for Linux. PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare. Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping'' of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time. The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in the pcmcia-modules-&#60;kernel version&#62; package, where &#60;kernel version&#62; is the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled. The wireless-tools package is required by wireless network adapters. The hotplug package is required by 2.4 (and later) series kernels to use PCI (Cardbus) devices. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;PCMCIA Modules for Linux (kernel 2.2.20). This package contains the set of loadable kernel modules for the PCMCIA Card Services applications program interface.  They have been compiled to be compatible with the kernel in the kernel-image-2.2.20 package version 2.2.20-5. If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to also recompile the PCMCIA modules.  The pcmcia-source package has been provided to help Debian users recompile the PCMCIA modules to work with their kernels' configurations.  (It also is possible to rebuild these modules using the Debian source files for the pcmcia-cs package.) The utilities in the pcmcia-cs package are required to use these modules. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Primary Domain Controler. This stores security and user account info for a domain. It manages all aspects of user/domain interaction. A domain has one PDC and can have multiple BDCs. BDCs hold backup copies of the PDC's info and are occasionally synchronized with the PDC. Both PDCs and BDCs can perform some tasks like user authentication. Often, a main site will have a PDC and a BDC (which can share the PDC's load for certain tasks) and remote sites will BDCs to handle certain tasks locally. From Linux Guide @FirstLinux

>&#13;Make PDF documents which are printable and readable on screen too pdfscreen is an extension of the hyperref package to provide a screen-based document design. This package helps to generate pdf documents that are readable on screen and will fit the screen's aspect ratio. Also it can be used with various options to produce regular print versions of the same document without any extra effort. One important utility of this package is to generate slides for talks, seminars etc. It produces a pdf file which can be used for a slideshow on any machine which has a pdf viewer.

>&#13;A public domain version of the Korn shell PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&#38;T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list of things not supported).  Work is currently underway to make it fully compatible with both POSIX and AT&#38;T ksh (when the two don't conflict). Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple machines.  For example, in the CS department of MUN, pdksh is installed on a variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, PCs running Linux, etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

>&#13;The perl data language. Perl extensions for numerics. PDL (``Perl Data Language'') gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language in the same sense as commercial packages like IDL and MatLab. One can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image in a few seconds. A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts. Web page: http://pdl.perl.org/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Proxy DNS Server pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache contents are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope with unreachable or down dns servers (for example in dial-in networking). pdnsd can be used with applications that do dns lookups, eg on startup, and can't be configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often minute-long hangs (or even crashes) that result from stalled dns queries. Some Netscape Navigator versions for Unix, for example, expose this behaviour. And it's IPv6 capable. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

It also includes a contributed interface for printing to Novell NetWare-based servers. The maintainer of the Linux Printing HOWTO recommends using this system standalone, or as a front-end to LPRng.

</B

><P
>&#13;Of historical interest only, PEM was the first Internet standard for encrypting/signing e-mail. It later evolved into S/MIME. Contrast: Core components of PEM influenced later standards such as SSL. For example, the certificates used by some SSL implementations end in the suffix ".pem". Contrast: PEM and PGP are functionaly similar as far as e-mail encryption is concerned. The main difference is that PEM is based upon PKI standards like X.509 certificates, whereas PGP uses more ad hoc technologies. The frameworks are completely incompatible, so that an e-mail encrypted using one system cannot be decrypted using the other. The basic difference in the framework is that PEM uses X.509 hierarchy of certificate authorities, whereas PGP uses a more distributed "web of trust". From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A penetration test is where a client hires ethical hackers to attempt to break into their systems. The value of pentration testing is that attack and defense are different mindsets. People who must defend against systems are frequently not very good at finding ways into systems, and vice versa. Controversy: There are several well-documented cases where clients have been burned by such tests. The penetration testers may find juicy corporate data that they cannot resist taking. Controversy: Many people debate the effecacy of such tests. Evil hackers will choose a set of techniques that protect them from being caught. Penetration testers do not fear prosecution, and will therefore choose a different set of techniques. See also: tiger team From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;POP3 and IMAP4 Proxy server Perdition allows users to connect to a content-free POP3 or IMAP4 server that will redirect them to their real POP3 or IMAP4 server. This enables mail retrieval for a domain to be split across multiple backend servers on a per user basis. This can also be used to as a POP3 or IMAP4 proxy especially in firewall applications. Perdition supports arbitrary library based map access to determine the server for a user. POSIX Regular Expression, GDBM, MySQL, PostgreSQL and LDAP libraries ship with the distribution.

>&#13;Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell scripting.  Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially good at handling text.  Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.  While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common applications (and what it excels at) are probably system administration utilities and web programming. A large proportion of the CGI scripts on the web are written in Perl. You need the perl package installed on your system so that your system can handle Perl scripts. You need perl-base to have a full perl. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

>&#13;PERL is a popular scripting language. PERL is so popular because: It runs on all platforms (UNIX, Windows, etc.) It easily parses text files and generates reports. It is easily to learn. Supports a large library of utilities to work from. Easily integrated into web-servers for CGI It is open-source Key point: v5 of PERL has the concept of "tainted" input that cannot be passed raw to the operating system without preprocessing. This is an amazingly useful feature that solves the majority of input validation problems in CGI scripts. Key point: A frequent misconfiguration is putting a PERL executable directly in the cgi-bin directory, allowing remote access of it. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Portable Forth Environment, ANS standard, all wordsets. PFE (Portable Forth Environment) is a programming environment for the programming language Forth. PFE is based on the ANSI Standard for Forth.  It has been created by Dirk-Uwe Zoller and is now maintained by Guido Draheim at Tektronix. Tektronix has made a number of extensions: PFE is now fully multithreaded and you can load additional C objects at runtime to extend the Forth dictionary.  It is best targeted for embedded environments since you can easily exchange the terminal driver and the initilization routines. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Progeny graphical installer creation system This package contains PGI, a multi-architecture graphical installer creation system for Debian GNU/Linux originally developed by Progeny Linux Systems, Inc., for their Debian-based "Progeny Debian" operating system. This package enables the user to create ISO images containing a bootable installer (PGI) which guides the user through the steps of installation.  The installer supports text and graphical installation modes.  PGI runs debootstrap to install a minimal Debian system to the target filesystem(s), sets up a boot loader (if the installing user requests), and uses the pivot_root() system call to "boot" into the installed system.  ISO images may be generated with complete or partial Debian package archives, or with the the installer only (useful for network-only installs, which PGI supports.) PGI is extensible and customizable.  Two example extensions are provided with this package; one uses the base-config package, while the other configures the installed system using the X-based Configlet system. Two manuals are provided as part of this package.  "Creating Debian Installers with PGI" documents the setup and configuration of a PGI-based installer ISO in detail.  "Using the PGI Debian Installer" is an example of a PGI user's manual.  Those creating custom installers with PGI will want to update the user's manual for their target audience.

>&#13;Popular encryption program. It was created by a fellow named Phil Zimmerman as a subversive act. Phil later exploited it as a social-engineering attack against the business community. Key point: All true hackers use open-source versions of PGP to encrypt their data. Resources: RFC 1991: PGP Message Exchange Formats RFC 2015: MIME Security with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) RFC 2440: OpenPGP Message Format Point: Users of PGP have choices of the following algorithms. Note that older v2.6 users can only use RSA/MD5/IDEA to read messages. encryption 3DES (aka. Triple-DES) The best choice for conservative people. The NSA claims that further proliferation of triple-DES is counter to national security interests, presumably because they cannot break it. It is the most analyzed cipher (and therefore believed to be the most secure) and is extensively used in the finance industry to protect transactions. IDEA A bad choice from the standpoint that it is protected by patents and many people are unable to use it. CAST5 AES The new United States standard, a good second choice, especially if speed is a concern. Twofish Blowfish public key RSA DSS (aka. DSA) DH/ELG-E Diffie-Hellman used for encryption, but not signing. ELG ElGamal signing, not recommended as it is considered weak. hash SHA1 The best choice for security paranoid people. MD5 The worst choice for paranoids, however, it is often the most popular. RIPEMD160 From Hacking-Lexicon

PHP-GTK: PHP language bindings for GTK+ toolkit PHP-GTK is a PHP extension that enables you to write client-side cross-platform GUI applications. This is the first such extension of this kind and one of the goals behind it was to prove that PHP is a capable general-purpose scripting language that is suited for more than just Web applications. This extension will _not_ allow you to display GTK+ programs in a Web browser, and can be used in the Web environment only if you are running the webserver locally. It is intended for creating standalone GUI applications. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The idea is based on the tapes used at Amateur Radio Conventions to test people's CW skills. However it is more random and can be made more difficult! You have to use a adlib or soundblaster compatible soundcard. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;The "ping" command is built into both Windows and UNIX machines as a universal way of testing network response time and performance. The name is really based off the similarity to sonar pings, though many people have create a post hoc acronym "Packet INternet Groper". Example: The ping-of-death attack used IP fragmentation to crash systems. It was so named because the ping program built-in to Windows could be easily told to fragment packets this way. Key point: Even though the ping program is simple, it can be abused. Some versions can be commanded to send packets as fast as possible, which is often done to flood networks. Most versions allow the packet size to be set to a large size, forcing fragmentation. When used with the flood above, it can overload machines since fragmentation reassembly is so slow. Contrast: There is an IRC command called "PING" that is unrelated to the ICMP ping. It is simply the text string "PING", where the target replies with "PONG". From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;[from the submariners' term for a sonar pulse] 1. n. Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a computer to check for the presence and alertness of another. The Unix command ping(8) can be used to do this manually (note that ping(8)'s author denies the widespread folk etymology that the name was ever intended as acronym for `Packet INternet Groper'). Occasionally used as a phone greeting. See ACK, also ENQ. 2. vt. To verify the presence of. 3. vt. To get the attention of. 4. vt. To send a message to all members of a mailing list requesting an ACK (in order to verify that everybody's addresses are reachable). "We haven't heard much of anything from Geoff, but he did respond with an ACK both times I pinged jargon-friends." 5. n. A quantum packet of happiness. People who are very happy tend to exude pings; furthermore, one can intentionally create pings and aim them at a needy party (e.g., a depressed person). This sense of ping may appear as an exclamation; "Ping!" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness). The form "pingfulness", which is used to describe people who exude pings, also occurs. (In the standard abuse of language, "pingfulness" can also be used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much stronger exclamation than just "ping"!). Oppose blargh. The funniest use of `ping' to date was described in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group comp.sys.next. He was trying to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting through. So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly invoked ping(8), listened for an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet. Result? A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and over, "Ping ... ping ... ping ..." as long as the network was up. He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector in no time.  From Jargon Dictionary

Pingus uses ClanLib, which allows you to compile Pingus under Windows and Linux, other operating systems might follow. A Windows version isn't available, but it should be possible to compile it from source. Under Linux it is possible to play Pingus under X or in fullscreen, using svgalib or OpenPTC, it runs in 640x480x16bpp. Pingus will have two main modes, one will be a full featured lemmings clone, with all of the basic actions (digger, bridger, etc.) and extensible to include new action and levels. The other mode will be a worms clone, with bazooka pingus, different weapons, etc.  At the moment the lemmings mode makes good progress, all basic pingus are painted and the implementation of them goes on. I haven't started to implement the worms mode yet, this will follow when I am finish with the lemmings mode. Both modes will have sub modes for multiplay, over Internet, LAN or split screen.

PKCS #1 - RSA Encryption and Signature Among other things, it defines details like how to pad messages. PKCS #3 - Diffie-Hellman Defines ASN.1 structures and algorithsm for DH key agreement PKCS #5 - Password-based Encryption Defines how to hash a password into a symmetric key. PKCS #7 - Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard (RFC 2315) Defines the structure of the digital envelope. Conceptually, it is a e-mail envelope that wraps an encrypted or signed message. However, the framework is used in places outside of e-mail as well. Contrast: PKCS7 is based upon PEM (Privacy Enhanced E-mail), RFC 1422. Essentially, PKCS7 is simply a PEM email in raw binary form without the headers/footers attached. S/MIME, a later standard than PEM, is simply a different wrapper around the PKCS7 envelope that conforms to the MIME standards. PKCS #10 - Certification Request Syntax Standard Used by Netscape and Microsoft web browsers, SSL libraries, ANSI X9.30. PKCS #11 - Cryptographic Token Interface Standard Abstract API for smart cards. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;PKI is the next wave of cryptography. Traditional cryptography (since the time of the ancient Greeks) has been based upon the concept of the "shared secret" (such as a password). This was good, but it suffered from the problem of having to communicate that secret among those people who should know it -- anybody who knew the secret could forge messages to anybody else or decrypt messages intended for other people. In 1970, a new technology called "asymmetric" cryptography was discovered in which a pair of keys could be used: one for encryption-only, and the other for decryption-only. The key used to encrypt could not decrypt, and vice versa. This peculiar mathematical property was discovered to be fantastically useful. For example, you can publish one of the keys to everyone in the world, who can then use it to encrypt a message to you that only you can decrypt. For this reason, the technology is better known as public-key cryptography. The technology works in the other direction as well. This means that you could encrypt a message with your private-key and send it out, and everyone with your public-key will know that it could only have come from you, because only you know your private-key. This authenticates that you are who you say you are. These and other properties provide solutions to a wide number of longstanding issues with cryptography. The various uses for public-keys have been bundled together in what is known as a new cryptographic infrastructure: PKI. Key point: PKI consists of: certificates A public and/or private key is stored in a file called a "certificate". It also includes identification information as to who the own of the certificate is, as well as a signature by a CA validating that the data hasn't been forged. Certificate Authorities (CA) Certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority, who usually will sign the certificate as well as provide some revocation facilities. Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) If the private-key is compromised (i.e. inadvertently made public), then the certificate containing that key needs to be "revoked". That essentially means the CA who assigned the certificate posts the certificate on its website. This allows people to publicly check this fact. repositories (e.g. LDAP directories) So that public-keys for people can be found. Uses: PKI (public-keys, certificates, etc.) is used in: S/MIME Secure e-mail. PGP Also secure e-mail. Smart card SSH SSL IPsec From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;X/Motif day planner (dynamically compiled with LessTif) Plan is a schedule planner based on X/Motif. It displays a month calendar similar to xcal, but every day box is large enough to show appointments in small print. By pressing on a day box, the appointments for that day can be listed and edited. Appointments are entered with the following information (everything except the time is optional):  - the date, time, and length of the appointment  - an optional text message to be printed,  - an optional script to be executed,  - early-warn and late-warn triggers that precede the alarm time  - repetitions: [n-th] weekdays, days-of-the-month, every n days, yearly  - optional fast command-line appointment entry  - flexible ways to specify holidays and vacations  - extensive context help  - multiuser capability using the netplan server, provided by the netplan package From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;n. [Unix] On systems that support finger, the `.plan' file in a user's home directory is displayed when the user is fingered. This feature was originally intended to be used to keep potential fingerers apprised of one's location and near-future plans, but has been turned almost universally to humorous and self-expressive purposes (like a sig block). See also Hacking X for Y. A recent innovation in plan files has been the introduction of "scrolling plan files" which are one-dimensional animations made using only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line feed, avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the finger command will (for security reasons; see letterbomb) not pass the escape character. Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some sites have started competitions to find who can create the longest running, funniest, and most original animations. Various animation characters include: Centipede: mmmmme Lorry/Truck: oo-oP Andalusian Video Snail: _@/ and a compiler (ASP) is available on Usenet for producing them. See also twirling baton.

>&#13;PLD RescueCD is a bootable disk that contains a live Linux distribution based on PLD Linux with a 2.4.20 modular kernel. This version uses transparent compression to fit about 130 MB of software onto a single mini CD 50 MB in usable form. These images are small enough to fit on most business card-sized CD-ROMs (approx. 50MB), but can be burned onto any standard CD-R or CD-RW, as well. PLD RescueCD can be used to rescue ailing machines, perform intrusion post-mortems, act as a temporary secure linux-based workstation (using ssh, vpn connecting to remote host - other networking clients are also supported), install PLD Linux, and perform many other as yet unimagined tasks. Initial version 1.00 was released April 6, 2003. Version 1.01 was released June 17, 2003.  From LWN Distribution List

Ploticus is not a function or mathematical plotting package like gnuplot, nor would it be a good choice for applications where mathematical formulas or scientific notations are to be rendered as an integral part of the data display.  Ploticus is also not intended as a "marketing" graphics package.  Its goal is to display data crisply without extra decoration and distracting "dingbats" that cloud the picture.

>&#13;Scientific plotting library PLplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable, and is rich enough to satisfy most users.  It has a wide range of plot types including line (linear, log), contour, 3D, fill, and almost 1000 characters (including Greek and mathematical) in its extended font set.  The package is designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; only a handful of function calls is typically required.  For more advanced use, virtually all aspects of plotting are configurable. APIs are provided for C, C++, and Fortran (Tcl/Tk bindings are available in a separate package plplot-tcl). A program for rendering Tektronix vector files is also included in this package. See http://emma.la.asu.edu/plplot for more information on PLplot. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Polytechnique Montreal Modula-3 The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is based on the DEC SRC Modula-3 programming environment. Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa, Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+. It also resembles its cousins Object Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid. The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while meeting the needs of modern systems programmers. Instead of exploring new features, they studied the features of the Modula family of languages that have proven themselves in practice and tried to simplify them into a harmonious language. They found that most of the successful features were aimed at one of two main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler, more systematic type system. Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the provision for explicit interfaces between modules. It adds objects and classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features. A large number of platform independent libraries are available for easily constructing distributed, graphical, multi-threaded applications. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;POP (Point of Presence, also Post Office Protocol)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;Two commonly used meanings: Point of Presence and Post Office Protocol. A Point of Presence usually means a city or location where a network can be connected to, often with dial up phone lines. So if an Internet company says they will soon have a POP in Belgrade, it means that they will soon have a local phone number in Belgrade and/or a place where leased lines can connect to their network. A second meaning, Post Office Protocol refers to a way that e-mail client software such as Eudora gets mail from a mail server. When you obtain an account from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) you almost always get a POP account with it, and it is this POP account that you tell your e-mail software to use to get your mail. Another protocol called IMAP is replacing POP for email. From Matisse

>&#13;An Internet electronic mail standard that specifies how an Internet-connected computer can function as a mail-handling agent. Messages arrive at a user's electronic mailbox, which is housed on the service provider's comuter. From this central storage point, you can access your mail from different computers - a networked workstation in the office as well as a PC at home. In either case, a POP-compatible electronic mail program, which runs on your workstation or PC, establishes a connection with the POP server, and detects that new mail has arrived. You can then download the mail to the workstation or computer, and reply to it, print it, or store it, as you prefer. From QUECID

>&#13;watch log for pop/imap auth, notify Postfix to allow relay Spam prevention requires preventing open relaying through email servers. However, legitimate users want to be able to relay. If legitimate users always stayed in one spot, they'd be easy to describe to the daemon. However, what with roving laptops, logins from home, etc., legitimate users refuse to stay in one spot. pop-before-smtp watches the mail log, looking for successful pop/imap logins, and posts the originating IP address into a database which can be checked by Postfix, to allow relaying for people who have recently downloaded their email. Contrary to other similar tools pop-before-smtp needs no hacking in the mail daemons. On the other hand it requires the pop3/imap daemons to run on the same machine as pop-before-smtp and postfix.

>&#13;In TCP/IP, a port is an extension of an Internet address that tells which program is to receive the data. In other words, if I send data to 192.0.2.111, port 110, then I'm talking to the POP3 e-mail service. However, if I send something to port 80 on the same machine, then I'm talking to the web server on that machine. Key point: I can have two URLs that look like http://robertgraham.com/ and http://robertgraham.com/. These two URLs access different web server programs running on the same machine, one at port 80 and that other at port 90. Misconception: Many people believe that the port correctly identifies the protocol that runs on that port. For example, the port 110 has been assigned to the POP3 e-mail service. However, even though this is the correct port for the protocol, somebody could put a different service on this port, such as HTTP. In this example, I could then supply URLs that looked like http://www.robertgraham.com:110/. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;On the Internet port often refers to a number that is part of a URL, appearing after a colon (:) right after the domain name. Every service on an Internet server listens on a particular port number on that server. Most services have standard port numbers, e.g. Web servers normally listen on port 80. Services can also listen on non-standard ports, in which case the port number must be specified in a URL when accessing the server, so you might see a URL of the form: gopher://peg.cwis.uci.edu:7000/ This shows a gopher server running on a non-standard port (the standard gopher port is 70). Finally, port also refers to translating a piece of software to bring it from one type of computer system to another, e.g. to translate a Windows program so that is will run on a Macintosh.

>&#13;port scan
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In hacker reconnaissance, a port scan attempts to connect to all 65536 ports on a machine in order to see if anybody is listening on those ports. Contrast: A stealth scan attempts to evade detection. The most common kind is a TCP half-open scan which fails to complete the three-way handshake. This prevents the application listening on a port from being notified that a connection attempt has taken place, so it won't log that fact. Most "stealth" scans attempt to evade logging on the host, but this makes more distinctive signatures that intrusion detection systems can detect. Key point: Ports scans are not illegal in many places, those laws have yet to be written on the subject. The Norwegian Supreme court ruled that they are not illegal because they don't actually compromise the system. There is also the technical problem that they can easily be spoofed, so it is hard to prove guilt. There is even the third problem that virtually any machine on the Internet can be tickled into scanning somebody else; the hacker doesn't break into that third party, but triggers special conditions that causes the effect of a port scan. Controversy: Many people think that port scanning is an overt hostile act and should be made illegal. Contrast: Full port scans of all 65536 ports are rarely seen, especially since they are so obvious. Instead, hackers will strobe for just the ports he/she is interested in. These strobes are for typically fewer than 10 ports. Also, the hacker will often sweep thousands (or millions) of machines rather than a single machine looking for any system that might be vulnerable. Tool: The best tool for doing port scans is nmap from http://www.insecure.org/nmap. From Hacking-Lexicon

><P
>&#13;In the UNIX RPC protocol suite, portmapper is responsible for locating which port number a particular RPC-based service is using. RPC programs are assigned a well-known "RPC program number" rather than well-known ports. In the RPC suite, the only program that is assigned a "well-known" port is the portmapper service at port 111. All the rest obtain a randomly assigned port number when they start up, then tell portmapper which port they are using. For example, the rpc.mountd RPC program is assigned the well-known program number of 100005. When it starts up, it might obtain the port number like 635. It then registers with the local portmapper (on the same machine) and gives it the [100005,635] combination. When a client program whishes to contact rpc.mountd, it first contacts portmapper and asks "where is program 1000005?". Portmapper replies with the current port, at which point the client program proceeds to talk with rpc.mountd on the correct port. Key point: In theory, you must have access to port 111 on the target machine in order to reach any RPC service. Therefore, some firewall administrators block access to port 111 on the mistaken belief that this will protect them. This belief is wrong because while it prevents an intruder from easily finding the target RPC services, they can still hunt for them. Using nmap, an intruder can first do a port scan to find open ports, then use the "NULL proc grinding" feature of nmap to figure out which RPC is listening on that port. Also, sometimes Sun puts another portmapper at a high port (like 32773) From Hacking-Lexicon

Next, the POST writes, then reads, various data patterns to each byte of memory (you can watch the bytes count off on-screen and often end the test with a keystroke); Finally, the POST communicates with every device; you see the keyboard and drive lights flash and the printer resets, for example.

>&#13;Object-relational SQL database, descended from POSTGRES. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database, which supports a large part of SQL-92.  It is under continuous development and each release implements more of the SQL standard, to the extent that it is now probably more compliant than many commercial databases.  It also supports some object-oriented features. As compared to MySQL, PostgreSQL is more fully featured - most importantly, PostgreSQL supports transactions on all tables, something which is essential to multi-user update of a database and referential integrity, which, equally, is essential to a reliable database.  The trade-off is that it can be slower, though again, each release sees improvements in efficiency. For more information, see &#60;http://OpenACS.org/why-not-mysql.html&#62;. This package provides the backend features; you need postgresql-client or some other front-end to be able to access them.  A package providing ident-server is needed if you want to authenticate remote connections with identd. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The postgresql package includes the client programs and libraries that you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQLclient programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal structure of PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server. These client programs can be located on the same machine with the PostgreSQL server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a PostgreSQLserver over a network connection. This package contains the client libraries for C and C++, as well as command-line utilities for managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.

Though Postscript is a programming language adn you can learn to write page descriptions in it, Postscript is usually invisible and automatic. Programs generate Postscript code that goes to the printer, where a Postscript interpreter follows the coded instructions to generate an image of the page precisely according to there instructions. A major benefit of Postscript is its device independence; you can print the Postscript code generated by an application on any printer with a Postscript interpreter. You can take Postscript files generated on your PC to a service bureaus which can print the document using expensive typesetting machines with resolutions of up to 2,400 dots per inch (dpi).

A Page Description Language (PDL), based on work originally done by John Gaffney at Evans and Sutherland in 1976, evolving through `JaM' (`John and Martin', Martin Newell) at XEROX PARC, and finally implemented in its current form by John Warnock et al. after he and Chuck Geschke founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982. PostScript gets its leverage by using a full programming language, rather than a series of low-level escape sequences, to describe an image to be printed on a laser printer or other output device (in this it parallels EMACS, which exploited a similar insight about editing tasks). It is also noteworthy for implementing on-the fly rasterization, from Bezier curve descriptions, of high-quality fonts at low (e.g. 300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task). Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time, and the combination of technical merits and widespread availability has made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.

>&#13;filter that inserts printer specific commands into print jobs ppdfilt is a filter program designed to be used within a filter script or from the command line tool to insert printer specific commands to a PostScript print job. This can be used to tell the printer to duplex or staple the print job, or tell it what paper tray to draw paper from. In the GNULpr printing environment, users do not call ppdfilt directly, but its features are accessed by using 'lpr' or 'gpr' (see) From Debian 3.0r0 APT

With the included fbview program, you can display virtually any picture format on any framebuffer. ppmtofb supports virtually all framebuffer devices, including vesafb and the VGA16 framebuffer for PCs.  On Amigas it can take advantage of the Hold and Modify (HAM) modes for virtual truecolor display on both standard and AGA systems.

>&#13;Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) daemon. The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to transmit datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines at either end of the link (the "peers") to negotiate various optional characteristics of the link.  Using PPP, a serial link can be used to transmit Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams, allowing TCP/IP connections between the peers. This package contains pppd with PAM support built-in, so `ppp-pam' package is obsolete. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;One of the two standards for directly connecting computers to the Internet via dialup telephone connections (the other is SLIP). Unlike the older SLIP protocol, PPP incorporates superior data negotiation, compression, and error correction. However, these features add overhead to data and transmission, and are unnecessary when both the sending and receiving modems offer hardware error correction and on-the-fly data compression.

PrBoom is a version of Doom using the Simple Direct Media layer (SDL) library, which enables it to use XFree86, Linux framebuffer console, GGI, SVGALib or even color or monochrome text consoles as display. PrBoom is based on MBF and LxDoom, which in turn is based on Boom, a freely available port of Doom for DOS, written by TeamTNT (http://www.teamtnt.com/). To play you need some maps, called "WAD", the shareware version of doom is included in the doom-wad-shareware package (non-free section). You can use any other DOOM WADs as well.

>&#13;The Project Revision Control System PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is the front end to a set of tools that (like CVS) provide a way to deal with sets of files and directories as an entity, preserving coherent versions of the entire set.

>&#13;A list of instructions, written in a programming language, that a computer can execute so that the machine arts in a predetermined way. Synonymous with software. The world of computer programs can be divided into system programs, utility pograms, and application programs: * System programs include all the programs the computer requires to function effectively, including the operating system, memory management software, and command-line interpreters The MS-DOS operating system is an example of system software. * Utility programs include all the programs you can use to maintain the computer system. MS-DOS includes several utility programmed such as CHKDSK. Most users equip their systems with utility packages (such as Norton Utilities or PC Tools) that go beyond the basics that MS-DOS provides. * Application programs transform the computer into a tool for performing a specific kind of work, such as word processing, financial analysis (with an electronic spreadsheet), or desktop publishing. Additional software categories include programming languages, games, educational programs, and a variety of vertical market programs.

>&#13;A high-level programming language used in artificial intelligence research and applications, particularly expert systems. PROLOG, short for PROgramming in LOGic, is a declarative language; rather than tell the computer what procedure to follow to solve a problem, the programmer describes the problem to be solved. The language resembles the query language of a database management system such as Standard Query Language (SQL) in that you can use PROLOG to ask a question such as, "Is Foster City in Californian's But an important difference exists between PROLOG and a database management system (DBMS). A database contains information you can retrieve; a PROLOG program, in contrast, contains knowledge, from which the program can draw inferences about what is true or false. From QUECID

>&#13;adj. 1. In marketroid-speak, superior; implies a product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the company's own hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and users, inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems standards, and thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer in. Often in the phrase "proprietary crap". 3. Synonym for closed-source, e.g. software issued in binary without source and under a restrictive license. Since the coining of the term open source, many hackers have made a conscious effort to distinguish between `proprietary' and `commercial' software. It is possible for software to be commercial (that is, intended to make a profit for the producers) without being proprietary. The reverse is also possible, for example in binary-only freeware.

It allows one to paste into a xterm on one display the contents of the selection of another display.  For example, it's useful for situations where you have a URL on one display, and want to access it with a browser running on another display.  You can select the URL, click "propagate", move over to the other display, and then paste into the browser. If you have the two displays on the same desk, you might be more interested in the package x2x.  However, x2x can only link two displays at once, whereas propsel can propagate selections between up to 8 displays. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

For example, client applications typically limit the length of a username that can be typed in. By manipulating the protocol raw, hackers can supply any sized username they want, sometimes causing a buffer overflow exploit. Key point: Protocols are either text-based or binary. Text-based protocols can be read directly off the wire and manipulated directly. Binary protocols require a protocol analyzer to decode them, and must be manipulated programmatically.

>&#13;protocol stack
</B
></DT

><P
>&#13;In networking, protocols are layered on top of each other, with each layer responsible for a different aspect of communication. For TCP/IP, the protocol stack looks something like: HTTP Telnet POP3 SNMP bootp TCP UDP ICMP IP ARP PPP Ethernet The way that you would use this diagram is the following paragraph: You use the protocol HTTP to request a web-page. The HTTP client (web-browser) contacts the HTTP server (web-site) using the protocol TCP. The protocol TCP segments all its work into IP packets. Routers on the Internet know how to forward the IP packets, but are clueless as to whatever is inside the IP packets. Your machine will use something like PPP or Ethernet in order to send IP packets to the nearest router. Key point: Encryption can happen at any layer. Payload The data itself can be encrypted independent of the protocols used to transport it. For example, a typical use of PGP is to encrypt a message before sending via e-mail. All the e-mail programs and protocols are totally unaware that this has occurred. Application Layer Some applications have the ability to encrypt data automatically. For example, SMB can encrypt data as it goes across the wire Transport Layer SSL is essentially encryption at the transport layer. Network Layer IPsec provides encryption at the network layer, encrypting all the contents above IP, including the TCP and UDP headers themselves. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;proxy
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;In communications, a proxy is something that acts as a server, but when given requests from clients, acts itself as a client to the real servers. Analogy: Consider talking to somebody who speaks a foreign language through a translator. You talk to the translator, who receives your statements, then regenerates something else completely to the other end. The translator serves as your proxy. Key point: The communication terminates at the proxy. In other words, the proxy doesn't forward data so much as it tears it completely apart. For example, an HTTP proxy doesn't forward every request sent through it. Instead, it first examines if it already has the requested web page in its cache. If so, then it returns that page without sending another request to the destination server. Because proxies completely terminate the communication channel, they are considered a more secure firewall technology than packet filters, because they dramatically increase the isolation between the networks. Key point: You will occasionally be scanned for proxies. ISPs scan their users for proxies. Hackers scan the Internet looking for proxies they can anonymize their connections with. Certain servers (like IRC servers) scan clients for proxies in order to prevent anonymous connections. Several websites maintain lists of such proxies. e.g. http://proxys4all.cgi.net/ From Hacking-Lexicon

Sometimes the Proxy server will store the results and give a stored result instead of making a new one (to reduce use of a Network). Proxy servers are commonly established on Local Area Networks.

>&#13;An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents. PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  It contains a simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. (The most popular nowadays are the HTML DTDs. This package turns your emacs into the one of most powerful HTML editors and will be ultimately flexible as well, since you could upgrade your editor by just installing new DTDs). Functions provided includes menus and commands for inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window with information about types and defaults, and structure based editing. Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do need to have the DTDs installed in order to use psgml. Since psgml installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data. Some other packages which also provide SGML DTDs are suggested, like debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml. SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)". Psgml is a standard package for XEmacs, and thus this package does not install itself for XEmacsen. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The available tools do use PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files to handle the features that are available on a given device (for example selecting a color model or the way two-sided pages are bound). The actual tools are psplpr, a printing/filtering tool that manipulates a PostScript document to control which features of a PS device will be used to print the document, and npslpr, a small command-line compatible replacement for pslpr which uses psplpr.

>&#13;A method of data encryption that involves two separate keys: a public key and a private key. Data encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the private key and vice versa. Typically, the public key is published and can be used to encrypt data sent to the holder of the private key, and the private key is used to sign data. From I-gloss

>&#13;public-key (private-key, asymmetric cryptography)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;Public-key cryptography uses two mathematically related keys, where a message encrypted by one key can only be decrypted by the other key. This is in stark contrast to traditional cryptography (now known as symmetric cryptography) where the same key was used for both encryption and decryption. The reason this is so important is because one of the two keys can be made public, hence the name "public-key cryptography". When this technique was discovered, it solved the biggest problem in cryptography at that time. In traditional symmetric cryptography, both the sender and receiver of a message had to agree upon the same key. Imagine your country has spies out in the field. If a spy gets captured, then the adversary could steal that key and decrypt messages. With asymmetric keys, however, the enemy can only steal the key the spy is using to encrypt messages, but cannot use that key to decrypt anything. The enemy may be able to forge messages, but the system wouldn't otherwise be compromised. Furthermore, the key could be extremely public: you could simply broadcast your public-key on the open airwaves for your spies to use. This is indeed what happens with SSL, the protocol you use to connect to e-commerce sites and pay for stuff with credit-cards. The public-key of the server is given out to everybody who connects to the site. However, each user encrypts his data using the public-key, which means nobody else can decrypt it without the secret private-key known only to the owners of the website. Example: Some uses of public-key encryption are: e-mail encryption Allows anybody to send an encrypted message to you that only you can read. The two most popular ways of doing this are PGP and S/MIME. digital signatures You can encrypt something with your private-key that can be decrypted by everyone (using your public-key). Therefore, if you encrypt a message, it proves it came from you, because only you know the private-key. Thus, you can digitally "sign" documents. President Clinton signed the "Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act" into law using a digital signature in this manner (using a smart-card with the password "Buddy"). Point: The public and private keys are mathematically related. In order to create them, you start with some randomly generated prime numbers. You then run these through some mathematical operations in order to generate the two keys. You publish one of the keys (making it "public") and you keep the other one private. Since the keys are rather large (hundreds of bytes), you generally store them in an encrypted file. Whenever you need to decrypt a message, you type in a password to decrypt the private-key, then use the private-key to decrypt the message. Key point: Protecting the "private key" from theft/disclosure is the most important thing any company can do. There is exist private keys whose value lie in the range of hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars (such as the key Verisign uses to sign certificates). The private key is usually protected with strong encryption based upon a strong password. In paranoid cases, parts of the password are given to different people, so that more than one person must be present in order to recover the private key for use (note: redundancy is also used, if the key is XYZ, then Alice knows XY, Bob knows YZ, and Charlene knows XZ, meaning that any two can unlock the private key). The paranoid things you see in movies about high-security installations apply: background checks on employees with access to the private key physical security consisting of photo IDs, searches, and strict entry/exit controls the two-person rule biometrics (retina/palm/finger/handwriting) additions to normal authentication physical keys Private-keys are frequently stored on separate objects. The most common is the floppy disk, which can be inserted into a server when booted, but removed to a safety deposit box. Other examples include crypto-cards. (Note: when you get a certificates from a CA, they usually require that the private-key never be stored on a computer). Servers that must use private keys must employ heavy countermeasures: intrusion detection systems firewalls (both packet filtering as well as more complex ones) frequent vulnerability assessments and auditing limited people who have access to the server full use of the security features of the server (i.e. turn on logging, enforce strong passwords, etc.) Example: Some public-key algorithms are: Diffie-Hellman The original one, though only designed for key-exchange. RSA The most popular algorithm. ElGamal Extends Diffie-Hellman algorithms to support the same features as RSA, such as encryption and digital-signatures. DSA Government standard for digital-signatures based upon ElGamal. Elliptic Curves Based upon a different mathematical problem from number theory and algebraic geometry. It results in smaller keys and faster operation, but is not as well analyzed as other systems. Other There are other systems based upon different hard-to-solve mathematical problems. Antonym: Sometimes the word "secret-key" is used as an antonym to "public-key" in order to highlight the fact that it is a shared-secret. Also, "symmetric" encryption is the antonym to "asymmetric".

>&#13;Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac and MFC). Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++. Python can be used as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. This package contains most of thestandard Python modules, as well as modules for interfacing to the Tix widget set for Tk and RPM. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM
