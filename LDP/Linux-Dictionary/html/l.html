Each user takes control of a computerized persona/avatar/incarnation/character. You can walk around, chat with other people, solve puzzles, and even create your very own rooms, descriptions and items. Advanced users can program Lambdamoo, via its built in object-oriented programming language. Lambdamoo only provides the bare framework for your virtual world. A lambdamoo guru could theoretically start with lambdamoo and the included minimal core database and work their way up to a full-fledged system. The rest of us will want to install the lambdacore or jhcore packages which add objects and functionality to lambdamoo. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;LAN Manager is the older file server product from Microsoft and IBM. The details of this aren't all that important except that backwards compatibility has introduced security holes in products 10 years later. LAN Manager authentication splits a password into two case-insensitive parts that are 7 letters each. Therefore, if your password was "RobertGraham.com", under LAN Manager it would be the same as "ROBERTG RAHAM.C". Whereas new products like Win98, WinNT, and SAMBA support newer/stronger authentication methods, the need for backwards compatibility often exposes the LAN Manager password, which can easily be cracked.

>&#13;Automatically adapt laptop ethernet This package supports the built-in ethernet of laptops by providing several integrated features that automatically adapt the laptop to the network environment.  The package is easily configured to support a wide variety of network environments, and supports manual as well as automatic management of the network interface. The package can automatically: start and stop the network interface at appropriate times; disable the network interface when the network cable is removed, and enable it when the cable is inserted; select the network interface's IP address, either by probing the network for known hosts or by use of the DHCP protocol; customize the laptop's software configuration to match the network interface's IP address.

>&#13;LaTeX to HTML translator. LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar word-processing concepts. LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references, citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes, paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final HTML document. LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document. Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format. Because of certain legal limitations on the use of the GIF image format, GIF support is disabled in this package. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A directory service, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is used by e-mail programs (Microsoft, Netscape, Eudora, etc.) to allow you to lookup a person's name in a corporate database and find their e-mail address, phone number, and other information that the corporate administrators decided to put in there. Key point: Most corporate LDAP servers have little or no authentication. Finding LDAP servers and downloading their contents is an important step in the reconnaissance phase of a hacking attack. Key point: While LDAP is in theory lightweight, in practice it is still fairly complicated. There are many implementation and deployment bugs that can be exploited in order to break into servers.

>&#13;LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. As the name suggests, it is a lightweight client-server protocol for accessing directory services, specifically X.500-based directory services. LDAP runs over TCP/IP or other connection oriented transfer services. LDAP is defined in RFC2251 "The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3). A directory is similar to a database, but tends to contain more descriptive, attribute-based information. The information in a directory is generally read much more often than it is written. Directories are tuned to give quick-response to high-volume lookup or search operations. They may have the ability to replicate information widely in order to increase availability and reliability, while reducing response time. When directory information is replicated, temporary inconsistencies between the replicas may be OK, as long as they get in sync eventually. There are many different ways to provide a directory service. Different methods allow different kinds of information to be stored in the directory, place different requirements on how that information can be referenced, queried and updated, how it is protected from unauthorized access, etc. Some directory services are local, providing service to a restricted context (e.g., the finger service on a single machine). Other services are global, providing service to a much broader context. From LDAP-Linux-HOWTO

>&#13;least privilege
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A best-practices principle that states that users have only the minimum access they need, and no more. Example: System administrators typically have multiple accounts with different rights. For example, when I'm logged in as a normal user, I do not have rights to administrator my own machine. I must login as a separate account in order to administer the system, then log out as soon as I'm done. Most UNIX systems will use the hash/pound sign # at the command prompt in order to hint to the user that they have root access and should be careful. Key point: One of the leading causes of security breaches is authorization creep: as users change roles, they often get new privileges, but old privileges are rarely taken away. From Hacking-Lexicon

When you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.

>&#13;The MPEG Library is a collection of C routines to decode MPEG movies and dither them in a variety of colour schemes.  Most of the code in the library comes directly from the Berkely MPEG player, an X11-specific implementation that works fine, but suffers from minimal documentation and a lack of modularity. A front end to the Berkeley decoding engine was developed by Greg Ward at theMontreal Neurological Institute in May/June 1994 to facilitate the development of an MPEG player specifically for Silicon Graphics workstations. The decoding engine together with the MNI front end constitute the MPEG Library. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

Key point: Most programs go through a high-level interface (like sockets) in order to send traffic on the network. Sometimes, for security or hacking reasons, a program needs to construct its own network headers. The existing TCP/IP stack is unable to build these headers, so you must bypass it and go directly to the hardware drivers. Libnet is a library that makes custom packet generation easier. Misunderstanding: Some people believe that libnet will not work on Win95 or WinNT because these systems do not support raw sockets. This is false -- libnet has been widely used on these platforms.

>&#13;Qt is a complete and well-designed multi-platform object-oriented framework for developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++. Qt hasseamless integration with OpenGL/Mesa 3D libraries. Qt is free for development of free software on the X Window System. It includes the complete source code for the X version and makefiles for Linux, Solaris,SunOS, FreeBSD, OSF/1, Irix, BSD/OS, NetBSD, SCO, HP-UX and AIX. This edition of Qt may be modified and distributed under the terms found in the LICENSE.QPL file. Qt also supports Windows 95 and NT, with native look and feel. Code developed for the X version of Qt can be recompiled and run using the Windows 95/NT version of Qt, and vice versa. Qt is currently used in hundreds of software development projects world wide, including the K Desktop Environment (see http://www.kde.org). For more examples, see http://www.trolltech.com/qtprogs.html. Qt has excellent documentation: around 750 pages of postscript and fully cross-referenced online html documentation. It is available on the web:http://doc.trolltech.com/Qt is easy to learn, with consistent naming across all the classes and a 14-chapter on-line tutorial with links into the rest of the documentation. A number of 3rd-party books are also available.Qt dramatically cuts down on development time and complexity in writing user interface software for the X Window System. It allows the programmer to focus directly on the programming task, and not mess around withlow-level Motif/X11 code. Qt is fully object-oriented. All widgets and dialogs are C++ objects, and, using inheritance, creation of new widgets is easy and natural. Qt's revolutionary signal/slot mechanism provides true component programming. Reusable components can work together without any knowledgeof each other, and in a type-safe way. Qt has a very fast paint engine, in some cases ten times faster than other toolkits. The X version is based directly on Xlib and uses neither Motif nor X Intrinsics. Qt is available under two different licenses:  - The Qt Professional Edition License, for developing fully commercial    software: see http://www.trolltech.com/pricing.html  - The Q Public License (QPL), for developing free software (X Window System    only). This package contains shared libraries. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

>&#13;Text-based genealogy software LifeLines is a genealogy program that runs on UNIX systems in text mode. It maintains genealogical records (persons, families, sources, events and others) in a database, and generates reports from those records. There are no practical limits on the number of records that can be stored in a LifeLines database, nor on the amounts or kinds of data that can be kept in the records. LifeLines does not contain built-in reports. Instead it provides a programming subsystem that you use to program your own reports and charts. Some standard report files are included in the lifelines-reports package. The programming subsystem also lets you query your databases and process your data in any way. LifeLines uses the terminal independent features of UNIX to provide a screen and menu based user interface. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;experiment with the OpenGL lighting model lightlab lets you set the colours and positions of several light sources, and then watch the effect that it has on a simple 3D scene.  You can select whether the scene contains a rotating cube, sphere, or teapot, and whether that object has a texture image on its surface. lightlab is not a modelling program; it doesn't even let you save anything. But if you're having trouble wrapping your brain around the various parameters you can set in OpenGL code, you may find it helpful. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Shows how objects moving at relativistic speeds look like. Light Speed! is an OpenGL-based program which illustrates the effects of special relativity on the appearance of moving objects. When an object accelerates past a few million meters per second, these effects begin to grow noticeable, becoming more and more pronounced as the speed of light is approached. These relativistic effects are viewpoint-dependent, and include shifts in length, object hue, brightness and shape. The moving object is, by default, a geometric lattice. 3D Studio and LightWave 3D objects may be imported as well. Best of all, the simulator is completely interactive, rendering the exotic distortions in real-time! From Debian 3.0r0 APT

LineControl Server then calls a certain shellscript and waits until a specified network - device is up (for analog lines), until /dev/isdninfo changes its status (if using the ISDN capabilities) or until a certain file exists. Then it sends to all connected Clients a message that the connection is established. The connection won't get killed until each client told to do so, had a timeout or has been terminated.

It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian policy as well as some checks for common errors. It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating expensive data-collection operations. This also possible to check the complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time. This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the archive. This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.1.0.0. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;&#60;operating system&#62; ("Linus Unix") /li'nuks/ (but see below) An implementation of the {Unix} {kernel} originally written from scratch with no proprietary code. The kernel runs on {Intel} and {Alpha} hardware in the general release, with {SPARC}, {PowerPC}, {MIPS}, {ARM}, {Amiga}, {Atari}, and {SGI} in active development.  The SPARC, PowerPC, ARM, {PowerMAC} - {OSF}, and 68k ports all support {shells}, {X} and {networking}.  The Intel and SPARC versions have reliable {symmetric multiprocessing}. Work on the kernel is coordinated by Linus Torvalds, who holds the copyright on a large part of it.  The rest of the copyright is held by a large number of other contributors (or their employers).  Regardless of the copyright ownerships, the kernel as a whole is available under the {GNU} {General Public License}.  The GNU project supports Linux as its kernel until the research {Hurd} kernel is completed. This kernel would be no use without {application programs}. The GNU project has provided large numbers of quality tools, and together with other {public domain} software it is a rich Unix environment.  A compilation of the Linux kernel and these tools is known as a Linux distribution.  Compatibility modules and/or {emulators} exist for dozens of other computing environments. The kernel version numbers are significant: the odd numbered series (e.g. 1.3.xx) is the development (or beta) kernel which evolves very quickly.  Stable (or release) kernels have even major version numbers (e.g. 1.2.xx). There is a lot of commercial support for and use of Linux, both by hardware companies such as {Digital}, {IBM}, and {Apple} and numerous smaller network and integration specialists.  There are many commercially supported distributions which are generally entirely under the GPL.  At least one distribution vendor guarantees {Posix} compliance. Linux is particularly popular for {Internet Service Providers}, and there are ports to both parallel supercomputers and {embedded} {microcontrollers}.  {Debian} is one popular {open source} distribution. The pronunciation of "Linux" has been a matter of much debate. Many, including Torvalds, insist on the short I pronunciation /li'nuks/ because "Linus" has an /ee/ sound in Swedish (Linus's family is part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority) and Linus considers English short /i/ to be closer to /ee/ than English long /i:/ dipthong.  This is consistent with the short I in words like "linen".  This doesn't stop others demanding a long I /li:'nuks/ following the english pronunciation of "Linus" and "minus".  Others say /li'niks/ following {Minix}, which Torvalds was working on before Linux. From Hyperdictionary From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02) [foldoc]

The pronunciation /lee'nuhks/ is preferred because the name `Linus' has an /ee/ sound in Swedish (Linus's family is part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority). This may be the most remarkable hacker project in history -- an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net (ports to Alpha and Sparc and many other machines are also in use). Linux is what GNU aimed to be, and it relies on the GNU toolset. But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the kernel to go with that toolset until 1999, which was too late. Other, similar efforts like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful but never caught fire the way Linux has; as this is written in 2000, Linux is seriously challenging Microsoft's OS dominance. It has already captured 31% of the Internet-server market and 25% of general business servers. An earlier version of this entry opined "The secret of Linux's success seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball effect." Truer than we knew. See bazaar. (Some people object that the name `Linux' should be used to refer only to the kernel, not the entire operating system. This claim is a proxy for an underlying territorial dispute; people who insist on the term `GNU/Linux' want the the FSF to get most of the credit for Linux because RMS and friends wrote many of its user-level tools. Neither this theory nor the term `GNU/Linux' has gained more than minority acceptance). From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Linux is a completely free reimplementation of the POSIX specification, with SYSV and BSD extensions (which means it looks like Unix, but does not come from the same source code base), which is available in both source code and binary form. Its copyright is owned by Linus Torvalds &#60;torvalds@transmeta.com&#62; and other contributors, and is freely redistributable under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). A copy of the GPL is included with the Linux source; you can also get a copy from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/COPYING Linux, per se, is only the kernel of the operating system, the part that controls hardware, manages files, separates processes, and so forth. There are several combinations of Linux with sets of utilities and applications to form a complete operating system. Each of these combinations is called a distribution of Linux. The word Linux, though it in its strictest form refers specifically to the kernel, is also widely and correctly to refer to an entire operating system built around the Linux kernel. For a list and brief discription of various distributions, see  http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Distribution-HOWTO.html None of these distributions is ``the official Linux''. Linux is not public domain, nor is it `shareware'. It is `free' software, commonly called freeware or Open Source Software[tm] (see http://www.opensource.org), and you may give away or sell copies, but you must include the source code or make it available in the same way as any binaries you give or sell. If you distribute any modifications, you are legally bound to distribute the source for those modifications. See the GNU General Public License for details. Linux is still free as of version 2.0, and will continue to be free. Because of the nature of the GPL to which Linux is subject, it would be illegal for it to be made not free. Note carefully: the `free' part involves access to the source code rather than money; it is perfectly legal to charge money for distributing Linux, so long as you also distribute the source code. This is a generalization; if you want the fine points, read the GPL. Linux runs on 386/486/Pentium machines with ISA, EISA, PCI and VLB busses. MCA (IBM's proprietary bus) is not well-supported in 2.0.x and earlier versions, but support has been added to the current development tree, 2.1.x. If you are interested, see http://glycerine.itsmm.uni.edu/mca There is a port to multiple Motorola 680x0 platforms (currently running on some Amigas, Ataris, and VME machines), which now works quite well. It requires a 68020 with an MMU, a 68030, 68040, or a 68060, and also requires an FPU. Networking and X now work. See news:comp.os.linux.m68k Linux runs well on DEC's Alpha CPU, currently supporting the "Jensen", "NoName", "Cabriolet", "Universal Desktop Box" (better known as the Multia), and many other platforms. For more information, see http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/FAQ.html Linux runs well on Sun SPARCs; most sun4c, sun4m, and sun4u machines now run Linux, with support for sun4 in development. Red Hat Linux is (as of this writing) the only Linux distribution available for SPARCs; see http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl-sparc/ Linux is being actively ported to the PowerPC architecture, including PowerMac (Nubus and PCI), Motorola, IBM, and Be machines. See http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~linuxppc/ and http://www.linuxppc.org/ Ports to other machines, including MIPS (see http://linus.linux.sgi.com and http://lena.fnet.fr/) and ARM, are under way and showing various amounts of progress. Don't hold your breath, but if you are interested and able to contribute, you may well find other developers who wish to work with you. Linux is no longer considered to be in beta testing, as version 1.0 was released on March 14, 1994. There are still bugs in the system, and new bugs will creep up and be fixed as time goes on. Because Linux follows the ``open development model'', all new versions will be released to the public, whether or not they are considered ``production quality''. However, in order to help people tell whether they are getting a stable version or not, the following scheme has been implemented: Versions n.x.y, where x is an even number, are stable versions, and only bug fixes will be applied as y is incremented. So from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3, there were only bug fixes, and no new features. Versions n.x.y, where x is an odd number, are beta-quality releases for developers only, and may be unstable and may crash, and are having new features added to them all the time. &#62;From time to time, as the currect development kernel stabilizes, it will be frozen as the new ``stable'' kernel, and development will continue on a new development version of the kernel. Note that most releases of the Linux kernel, beta or not, are relatively robust; ``stable'' in this context means ``slow to change'' in addition to ``robust''. The current stable version is 2.0.35 (this will continue to change as new device drivers get added and bugs fixed), and development has also started on the experimental 2.1.x kernels. The Linux kernel source code contains a file, Documentation/Changes, which explains changes that you should be aware of when upgrading from one kernel version to another. However, the great majority of Linux users simply update their Linux distribution occasionally to get a new kernel version. Most versions of Linux, beta or not, are quite robust, and you can keep using those if they do what you need and you don't want to be on the bleeding edge. One site had a computer running version 0.97p1 (dating from the summer of 1992) for over 136 days without an error or crash. (It would have been longer if the backhoe operator hadn't mistaken a main power transformer for a dumpster...) Others have posted uptimes in excess of a year. One site still had a computer running Linux 0.99p15s over 600 days at last report. One thing to be aware of is that Linux is developed using an open and distributed model, instead of a closed and centralized model like much other software. This means that the current development version is always public (with up to a week or two of delay) so that anybody can use it. The result is that whenever a version with new functionality is released, it almost always contains bugs, but it also results in a very rapid development so that the bugs are found and corrected quickly, often in hours, as many people work to fix them. In contrast, the closed and centralized model means that there is only one person or team working on the project, and they only release software that they think is working well. Often this leads to long intervals between releases, long waiting for bug fixes, and slower development. The latest release of such software to the public is sometimes of higher quality, but the development speed is generally much slower. For a discussion of these two models, read ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar'' at http://sagan.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/ by Eric Raymond. As of September 1, 1998, the current stable version of Linux is 2.0.35, and the latest development version is 2.1.119. From Linux-Intro-HOWTO

Now LDP has aggressively migrated into the DocBook world, but many documents are still available in LinuxDoc DTD sgml. So users may still need the tool for LinuxDoc, therefore LinuxDoc-Tools was created on the basis of sgml-tools_v1. The main command is linuxdoc, and -B option is provided to choose the proper backend driver for desired output. linuxdoc -B check: for syntax checking linuxdoc -B html: conversion to html linuxdoc -B info: conversion to info linuxdoc -B latex: conversion to latex, dvi, and postscript linuxdoc -B lyx: conversion to lyx linuxdoc -B rtf: conversion to rtf linuxdoc -B txt: conversion to text HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package, but for the other formats the appropriate packages will have to be installed.  - Text conversion requires groff  - LaTeX conversion requires tetex-base, tetex-bin, and tetex-extra  - Info conversion requires texinfo You can install linuxdoc-tools-text for required dependency of text conversion.  linuxdoc-tools-latex and linuxdoc-tools-info are provided for dependencies of latex or info conversion. This linuxdoc-tools has been designed and implemented only for linuxdoc DTD. If you wish to convert debiandoc DTD documents, Please install and use debiandoc-sgml package. If you wish to convert docbook DTD documents, Please install and use jade (with or without sgmltools-lite). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;LIRC is a package that allows you to decode and send infra-red signals of many (but not all) commonly used remote controls. Former versions docussed on home-brew hardware connected to the serial and parallel port. Current versions of LIRC also support a varity of other hardware. The most important part of LIRC is the lircd dameon that will decode the IR signals received by the device drivers and provide information on a socket. It will also provide the information on a socket. It will also accept commands for IR signals to be sent if the hardware suports this. The second daemon program called lircmd will connect to lircd and traslate the decoded IR signals to mouse movements. For example, you can configure X to use your remote control as a remote input device. The user space applications allow you to control your computer with your remote control. You can send X events to applications, start programs and much more on just one button press. The possible applications are obvious: Infra-red mouse, remote control for your TV tuner card or CD-ROM, shutdown by remote, program your VCR and/or satellite tuner with your computer, etc. MP3 players are also quite popular.

Lists are the fundamental data structure of LISP, and the program performs computations on the symbolic values expressed in those lists.

>&#13;n. [from `LISt Processing language', but mythically from `Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses'] AI's mother tongue, a language based on the ideas of (a) variable-length lists and trees as fundamental data types, and (b) the interpretation of code as data and vice-versa. Invented by John McCarthy at MIT in the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other HLL still in use except FORTRAN. Accordingly, it has undergone considerable adaptive radiation over the years; modern variants are quite different in detail from the original LISP 1.5. The dominant HLL among hackers until the early 1980s, LISP now shares the throne with C. Its partisans claim it is the only language that is truly beautiful. See languages of choice. All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return values; this, together with the high memory utilization of LISPs, gave rise to Alan Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar Wilde quote) that "LISP programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing". One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example that most newer languages, such as COBOL and Ada, are full of unnecessary crocks. When the Right Thing has already been done once, there is no justification for bogosity in newer languages. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;Live audio streaming application LiveIce is a live streaming program that allows input either from your soundcard's line in or from mp3 files to be mixed and re-encoded and then streamed to an icecast server.  This means that you can use liveice with your microphone and do live audio broadcasts, or even use a mp3 playlist and use the multi channel support to speed up, slow down, adjust volumes, and mix between the two channels, and then re-encode the data at a lower bitrate to be sent out to a icecast server.

>&#13;GTK letters-learning game for small children This is based on author's daughter's (formerly) favorite game, Larry's Learning Letters and Numbers. This is a Linux replacement, written from scratch, with many improvements.  It was built using the GTK (Gimp ToolKit) for X.  It presently works with 1.0.x and 1.1.x, but images load faster with the newer library. It is intended for children 2 and up, and is a fun learning game.  It helps younger chilren learn their letters and numbers, while older children will improve their spelling, and vocabulary skills.  It also helps them develop important keyboard and mouse skills too. You can have more than one image for each word, more than one word for each letter, and you can add new images without recompiling too. THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE, use it at your own risk.

>&#13;Utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors Lm-sensors is a hardware health monitoring package for Linux. It allows you to access information from temperature, voltage, and fan speed sensors. It works with most newer systems. This package contains programs to help you set up and read data from lm-sensors. You will need lm-sensors and i2c kernel modules to use this package. This requires installing the lm-sensors-source package, and possibly the kernel-package package, and using those to build lm-sensors modules.  i2c modules can be built from either the i2c-source package or from the Linux kernel sources (version 2.4.13 or later).

>&#13;Kernel drivers to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors (source) Lm-sensors is a hardware health monitoring package for Linux. It allows you to access information from temperature, voltage, and fan speed sensors. It works with most newer systems. This package contains the source for kernel modules that are necessary to access the data. The kernel sources must be installed to compile these modules. lm-sensors requires a separate set of drivers to access the I2C bus.  If you are using kernel 2.4.13 or newer, it is sufficient to enable "I2C /proc support" and a set of I2C drivers in your kernel configuration. If you have an older kernel or want more up-to-date support, you need to also install the i2c-source package and build modules from that. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Linux On A Floppy (LOAF) is a small yet extensible distribution of the Linux operating system. As the name implies, LOAF generally fits on a single floppy, but is not limited to just one, or floppies at all for that matter. LOAF's "new" [December 2001] intended purpose is a base in which the user can expand to his or her liking. Version 1 was essentially 'ssh on a floppy', as this was its initial raison d'etre. As of version 2, however, LOAF is a much more generic distribution, meant to be expanded via packages. It can be a client, it can be a server, it can be a router. The ultimate function of LOAF is completely up to the user. A floppy-based distribution. From LWN Distribution List

>&#13;Log files are rotated daily or weekly by the logrotate package. Its configuration file is /etc/logrotate.conf. For each package that happens to produce a log file, there is an additional configuration file under /etc/logrotate.d/. It is also easy to write your own - begin by using one of the existing files as an example. Rotation means that the log file is renamed with a .1 extension and then truncated to zero length. The service is notified by the logrotate program, sometimes with a SIGHUP. Your /var/log/ may contain a number of old log files named .2, .3, etc. The point of log file rotation is to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. From Rute-Users-Guide

><P
>&#13;UNIX has a strict policy of not reporting error messages to the user interface whenever there might be no user around to read those messages. Whereas error messages of interactive commands are sent to the terminal screen, error or information messages produced by non-interactive commands are ``logged'' to files in the directory /var/log/.  A log file is a plain text file that continually has one-liner status messages appended to it by a daemon process. The usual directory for log files is /var/log. The main log files are /var/log/messages and possibly /var/log/syslog. It contains kernel messages and messages from a few primary services. When a service would produce large log files (think web access with thousands of hits per hour), the service would use its own log file. sendmail, for example, uses /var/log/maillog. Actually, lpd does not have a log file of its own--one of its failings. View the system log file with the follow option to tail: tail -f /var/log/messages; tail -f /var/log/syslog. Restarting the lpd service gives messages like: [Not all distributions log this information.] . Jun 27 16:06:43 cericon lpd: lpd shutdown succeeded; Jun 27 16:06:45 cericon lpd: lpd startup succeeded. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;log out from your X session by pressing a button on your screen. This is a button that appears on your screen when you log into xdm. When you press it, it logs you out of the session. You need to have a file called .xsession in your home dir that starts the logout button in the foreground and your window manager in the background. By putting other things in this file, you can do things like change your background to your favorite image, start a clock and/or a terminal window, or even add a rotating earth or fish tank! You can start any number of programs as long as you background them. An example of .xsession is in /usr/doc/logout-button/examples and if you edit it choosing your favorite window manager, it will try to find and use it. Remember to place it in ~you/.xsession and make it executable. If you don't edit it, it will try to find and use the fvwm2 window mgr. X infrastructure has a mechanism which waits for some program to exit indicating the user wishes to end his X session. logout-button is the simplest form of such a "session manager". The example .xsession file provided in the doc/examples directory picks a window manager to run, starts it in the background, optionally starts other clients (xterm, xearth, xfishtank) also in the background and finally starts the session manager (logout-button) in the foreground, replacing the process and process ID belonging to the shell interpreting the .xsession. Because the infrastructure of X is waiting for this process to exit, when logout-button is pushed, the session is ended. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

><P
>&#13;Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX. Lout is a document formatting system similar in style to LaTeX, i.e. it works with mark-up files - plain text files containing commands to control the formatting. Lout offers a very full range of features, including  o PostScript, PDF, and plain text output  o optimal paragraph and page breaking  o automatic hyphenation  o PostScript EPS file inclusion and generation  o equation formatting, tables, diagrams  o rotation and scaling  o sorted indexes, bibliographic databases  o running headers and odd-even pages, automatic cross referencing  o multilingual documents including hyphenation (most European languages are    supported, including Russian),  o formatting of C/C++ programs. Lout may be extended by writing definitions which are much simpler than the equivalent troff or TeX macros. Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout (including writing definitions) than in TeX or LaTeX.  Lout's PostScript output is very small and clean. However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to find many Lout documents floating around the 'net. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x &#62;= V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x a vector of (nonnegative) variables, V1 a vector called the right hand side, and V2 a vector specifying the objective function. An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer and others are real. The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, &#60;=, &#62;= or =. The result specifies values for all variables. lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can read MPS format input files.

>&#13;LPRng is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality. LPRng provides the same interface and meets RFC1179 requirements, but the implementation is completely new and provides support for the following features:lightweight (no databases needed) lpr, lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic redirection of print queues; automatic job holding; highly verbose diagnostics; multiple printers serving a single queue; client programs do not need to run SUID root; greatly enhanced security checks; and a greatly improved permission and authorization mechanism. LPRng is compatible with other print spoolers and network printers that use the LPR interface and meet RFC1179 requirements. LPRng provides emulation packages for the SVR4 lp and lpstat programs, eliminating the need for another print spooler package. These emulation packages can be modified according to local requirements, in order to support older printing systems. For users who require secure and/or authenticated printing support,LPRng supports Kerberos V, MIT Kerberos IV Print Support, and PGPauthentication. Additional authentication support is very simple to add. From Redhat 8.0 RPM

Also contains some directories LSB tests look for that aren't owned by other Mandrake packages, and scripts to re-create the old /sbin/fasthalt and /sbin/fastboot. Currently, to be able to run the LSB binary test suit successfully, you need to boot with devfs=nomount, as well as insure that the partitions containing /tmp and /home are mounted with the option 'atime', rather than 'noatime'. You should also note that using the fstab option 'acl' for Posix ACLs will generate 1 test failure. This is not enabled by default on Mandrake Linux. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

>&#13;baby shell for novices with DOS compatible commands Lsh is a shell partially inspired by some command interpreters for PC monitors (such as 4-DOS, DR-DOS, MS-DOS, N-DOS, PC-DOS, Q-DOS and others, which might be trademarks of their owners and which is hereby acknowledged).  However, most of the features of this shell are simply adapted from Unix (which also happens to be a trademark) shells. Lsh is especially useful for users who have had some DOS experience and are now supposed to do something under UNIX. This shell will ease the transition and make the usage of dialup services extremely easy for them. Note that this has nothing to do with the lsh Secure Shell v2 (SSH2) protocol implementation.  If you need that SSH2 client, install lsh-client and see the lshc command.  upstream webpage: http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~mwelz/lsh.html From Debian 3.0r0 APT

Why do certain synchronization problems occur? What exactly happens to an application when a packet is received for it? Overall, where do all the applications that I use pass their time? Where are the I/O latencies in a given application? etc. LTT requires a modified linux kernel that enables events to be logged.

>&#13;Linux Cross-Reference The Linux Cross-Reference project is the testbed application of a general hypertext cross-referencing tool.  (Or the other way around.) The main goal of the project is to create a versatile cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories.  The project is based on stock web technology, so the codeview client may be chosen from the full range of available web browsers.  On the server side, any Unix-based web server with cgi-script capability should do nicely. The main feature of the indexer is of course the ability to jump easily to the declaration of any global identifier.  Indeed, even all references to global identifiers are indexed.  Quick access to function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros makes code browsing just that tad more convenient.  At-a-glance overview of e.g. which code areas that will be affected by changing a function or type definition should also come in useful during development and debugging. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

LysKOM consists of a server process and several client programs. The server process maintains a data base of persons, conferences and articles. The clients connect to the server and let the users browse the database for unread articles. LysKOM is much faster than netnews - almost as fast as irc or ICQ! - but like in netnews the articles are saved so that you don't have to be logged in to receive the news. From Debian 3.0r0 APT
