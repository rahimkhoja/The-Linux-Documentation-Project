>&#13;n. 1. Used in various speech and writing contexts (also in lowercase) in roughly its algebraic sense of `unknown within a set defined by context' (compare N). Thus, the abbreviation 680x0 stands for 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, or 68040, and 80x86 stands for 80186, 80286, 80386, 80486, 80586 or 80686 (note that a Unix hacker might write these as 680[0-6]0 and 80[1-6]86 or 680?0 and 80?86 respectively; see glob). 2. [after the name of an earlier window system called `W'] An over-sized, over-featured, over-engineered and incredibly over-complicated window system developed at MIT and widely used on Unix systems.

>&#13;The X Toolkit ( libXt.so) is a widget library that has always come free with X. It is crude-looking by today's standards. It doesn't feature 3D (shadowed) widgets, although it is comes free with X. [The excellent xfig application, an X Toolkit application, was in fact used to do the diagrams in this book.]Motif ( libM.so) is a modern, full-featured widget library that had become an industry standard. Motif is, however, bloated, slow, and dependent on the X toolkit. It has always been an expensive proprietary library. Tk (tee-kay, libtk.so) is a library that is primarily used with the Tcl scripting language. It was probably the first platform-independent library (running on Windows, all UNIX variants, and the Apple Mac). It is, however, slow and has limited features (this is progressively changing). Both Tcl and Motif are not very elegant-looking. Around 1996, we saw a lot of widget libraries popping up with different licenses. V, xforms, and graphix come to mind. (This was when I started to write coolwidgets--my own widget library.) There was no efficient, multipurpose, Free, and elegant-looking widget library for UNIX. This was a situation that sucked and was retarding Free software development. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;X Windows forms the basis for most GUIs on UNIX. It is based upon a network protocol such that a program can run on one computer but be displayed on another. Conceptually, it is a graphical version of Telnet. Key point: X Windows goes in the "wrong" direction. When you log into an X Windows host, the host opens a connection back to the display. As a consequence, it is very useful as a back-channel. In particular, the program xterm provides a raw command-prompt from which a hacker can interact with just as if they had telnetted to the machine. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Operate X-10 electrical power control modules. X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set back a thermostat. This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your system. You can use it to automate your home! It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your computer to turn itself on at a particular time. You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores, but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order one are included in the documentation of this package. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays, or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically, the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension. (The servers shipped by Debian support this.) x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases, and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only two at a time.

It does this by overloading the Xlib function XMapWindow with a version that signals the tracking xalf process. Xalf provides (currently) four different types as "indicators", described below. Invisible Window:    Xalf creates an invisible window, to be used in conjunction    with a standard task pager like Gnomes tasklist_applet or the    KDE Taskbar. The name of the window is the application name    within parenthesis. The small window icon (KWM_WIN_ICON) is    set to a small hourglass. This indicator is default. Splash screen:    An generic splashscreen is displayed during application    launch.

You start by firing out the ball from your paddle, which can be moved left and right parallel to the wall below it. The ball will move and hit the bricks located above, and when it hits a brick it will fall apart (i.e. dissappear), but the ball will bounce back to hit other bricks, sidewalls or the highest wall. If it falls down not hitting the paddle, you lose one life and have to start over. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Monitor mailboxes and/or newsgroups Xbuffy is a program that displays how many unread mails you have in your different mailboxes.  You can have different titles for the mailboxes, and define what shall happen when a new mail arrives.  It can beep and invoke a shell command, for example. Xbuffy can also notify you by blinking a keyboard LED when new mail has arrived. If you press mouse button 1 on the title associated with a mail box, a list of From: and Subject: lines of the mails in the mail spool file is shown.  If you press mouse button 2, an arbitrary command is executed.  If you press mouse button 3, the LED blinking is stopped until another mail has arrived. Xbuffy can similarly watch newsgroups via NNTP. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

If the xutils package is installed, xdm can use the sessreg utility to register login sessions to the system utmp file; this, however, is not necessary for xdm to function. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

It depends on the xemacs21-support package for lisp and etc files, and the xemacs21-bin package for supporting binaries.  This binary has been compiled with support for mule, but no input extensions. This version has also been compiled to use features from gtk and gnome. Mule is the extension to (x)emacs that allows for the display of non-European characters (for example Japanese and Korean characters). This version of the package is mainly useful for only the display and reading of international characters.  It does not have any mechanism for entering non-European characters (see the xemacs21-mule-canna-wnn package for that). This package actually contains one of the six xemacs binaries available.  They are xemacs21-nomule, xemacs21-mule, xemacs21-mule-canna-wnn, xemacs21-gnome-nomule, xemacs21-gnome-mule, and xemacs21-gnome-mule-canna-wnn. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

For more than a decade, from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice, windows, and icons style of software interface was invented there. So was the laser printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a decade. Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honor in their own company, so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place that specialized in developing brilliant ideas for everyone else. The stunning shortsightedness and obtusity of XEROX's top-level suits has been well anatomized in "Fumbling The Future: How XEROX Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer" by Douglas K.

This lets you know at a glance who you have mail from. XFaces starts out (when you have no mail) looking like a color xbiff. As you receive mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images. Some of XFaces features: - Both mono and color images. - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm. - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2), SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later. - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only show up once on your display. This way, if you receive 30 messages from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once. - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but left in your system mailbox. - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This includes the ability to run user command to generate the image list. - Support for POP mailboxes. - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority item needs your attention. - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can be used. - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname, count, user@host, the contents of any header.

>&#13;X file and application manager Xfm is an file and application manager program for the X Window System, based on the Xaw3d widget set.  It provides virtually all of the features that you would expect in a file manager; move around your directory tree in multiple windows, move, copy or delete files, and launch programs with simple mouse operations.  Directory displays are updated automatically in regular intervals when the contents of the directory change.  The integrated application manager provides a kind of "shelf" onto which you can place your favorite applications, as well as the files and directories you are currently working with.  It also allows you to access different groups of applications and files.  User-definable file types let you specify a command to be executed when double-clicking on a file or dropping other files onto it. Last not least, xfm can automatically mount and unmount special devices like floppies as you open and close the corresponding directories (mount points). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;If you want to install the X Window System (TM) on your machine, you'll need to install XFree86.The X Window System provides the base technology for developing graphical user interfaces. Simply stated,X draws the elements of the GUI on the user's screen andbuilds methods for sending user interactions back to the application. X also supports remote application deployment--running an application on another computer while viewing the input/outputon your machine.  X is a powerful environment which supports many different applications, such as games, programming tools, graphics programs, text editors, etc.  XFree86 is the version of X which runs on Linux, as well as other platforms. This package contains the basic fonts, programs and documentationfor an X workstation.  You will also need the XFree86-serverpackage, which contains the program which drives your video hardware. In addition to installing this package, you will need to install the drakxtools package to configure your card using XFdrake. You may also need to install one of the XFree86 fonts packages.And finally, if you are going to develop applications that run asX clients, you will also need to install XFree86-devel.

>&#13;X was developed by the X Consortium as a standard as well as a reference implementation of that standard. There are ports to every platform that supports graphics. The current version of the standard is 11 release 6 (hence the directory /usr/X11R6/). There will probably never be another version. XFree86 &#60;http://www.xfree86.org/&#62; is a free port of X that includes LINUX Intel machines among its supported hardware. X has some peculiarities that are worth noting if you are a Windows user, and XFree86 has some over those. XFree86 has its own versioning system beneath the ``11R6''. From Rute-Users-Guide

>&#13;X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further installation of the X Window System in any configuration. Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will also require the xserver-common package and an X server package (most likely xserver-xfree86). The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages, and likely many more client packages. Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages. For convenience, the "x-window-system" metapackage will include everything that is required for a standalone X workstation. A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.4".  The version of X used in Debian is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system. Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in /usr/share/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.

>&#13;Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems. xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures and also between IRIX machines. xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

It provides xine, a skin based media player that can play all the audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this includes MPEG1/2, some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found on http://xine.sf.net/. This package contains an additional front end, aaxine, which runs even on the console. aaxine uses aalib to render ASCII art video, or you can tell it to use a framebuffer device. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-) Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs, because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information! From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The X libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is often used as a foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw, the Athena widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface elements (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes, etc.).  Several more libraries are provided to implement the functions of various X extensions. X clients compiled against libc5 require that the X libraries be compiled against libc5 as well.  xlib6 provides such backward compatibility. To avoid redundancy, this package depends on the current version of the X library packages for various non-binary files used by the X libraries (bitmaps, locale data, etc.). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;X Window System client libraries The X libraries are an interface between X client programs and the hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X libraries, and the programs that use them, communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol. libX11 (a.k.a. Xlib) provides the low-level functionality, dealing mostly with the wire protocol and in terms of basic operations such as opening and closing the X protocol connection, creating graphics contexts, drawing graphics primitives such as lines, arcs, and glyphs, handling events, and so forth. libXpm, the X pixmap library, is a set of routines used to store and retrieve X pixmaps (a data structure comprising a rectangular array of pixels) from files; the xpm file format is an extension of the monochrome bitmap file format in the X11 specification.  (Traditionally, libXpm was maintained and distributed separately from the X Window System, but XFree86 has absorbed this library). libXt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is an abstract widget library upon which graphical widget libraries (such as Athena and LessTif) may be developed; the Intrinsics provide a number of useful interfaces to X conventions and protocols, in many cases reducing a long series of Xlib calls to just a couple of Xt calls. libXmu is a set of miscellaneous utility functions useful to client programmers. libXmuu is a very small set of miscellaneous utility functions extracted from Xmu, Xt, and Xaw, for clients that need the occasional useful function from these libraries but do not require the toolkit overhead.  To use libXmuu, simply include the headers for the other libraries in the client and link against Xmuu instead of Xmu, Xt, and Xaw.  Needless to say, if the client uses functions from Xmu, Xt, or Xaw that are not present in Xmuu, it will fail to link. The remainder of the libraries in this package implement the client side of various X protocol extensions:  - libICE, the Inter-Client Exchange extension;  - libPEX5, PEX, a 3D graphics extension now superseded by Mesa/OpenGL;  - libSM, the Session Management extension;  - libXIE, the X Image Extension;  - libXext, a collection of several commonly-used extensions;  - libXft, a FreeType-based font rendering extension;  - libXi, the X Input extension;  - libXp, the X Printing extension; and  - libXrender, an extension for digital image composition;  - libXtst, the X Testing extension. xlibs also contains the XKB keyboard parameter files, locale data, and a set of bitmap and pixmap image files commonly used by X clients.

Each row is presented as a "card" consisting of multiple columns, or "fields", that allow data entry. The presentation of the data is programmable; a user interface builder that allows the user to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of grok. Grok also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries and data retrieval. Grok comes with the above examples and a few others as pre-built applications. Grok is not a general-purpose database program. It was designed for small applications typical for desktop accessories.

>&#13;XML is an HTML-like formatting language. Misconception: The recommended advice when developing Internet protocols has been be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive. While in the early days this philosophy fostered interoperability, any economist could tell you the long term effect of this. It leads to a large number of slightly incompatible implementations of protocols, all of which mostly work, but none of which interopate well. For example, FTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols, and there are essentially no fully complient clients or servers, and building a fully interopable client/server is extremely difficult, requiring knowledge of all the quirks of all the popular implementations. Therefore, XML has chosen the opposite approach: compliant implementations are supposed to reject all input that isn't "well-formed", even when the intent is clear. This not only avoids interoperability errors in the long run, it also dramatically improves security by guaranteeing that there is only one way to interpret things. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;In computer science, an XOR is a mathematical operation that combines two bits. The resulting value is TRUE if either of the two bits is TRUE, but false if both are equal. In cryptography, one generally talks about doing an XOR combining two strings of bits: plaintext  11100101 01110101key         00001111 00001111            ------------------ciphertext 11101010 01111010XOR has the interesting property that XORing by the same pattern twice results in the original pattern: ciphertext 11101010 01111010key         00001111 00001111            ------------------plaintext  11100101 01110101Therefore, you can think of XOR as an extremely weak encryption algorithm. The above example shows using XOR as a way of encrypting the original data with the 8-bit key of "00001111". Many products use this technique to obfuscate data. However, it is extremely easy to recover the original key via a known plaintext attack, as show below: ciphertext 11101010 01111010plaintext  11100101 01110101           ------------------key         00001111 00001111Key point: XOR is a common mathematical operation used in cryptographic algorithms. In fact, the only 100% secure form of encryption is XORing against a one-time pad. Also, any hash algorithm can be converted into an encryption algorithm though a clever use of XOR.

Xprobe's functionality is comparable to the OS fingerprinting feature in nmap, but has several advantages over it:  - Faster: A maximum of 4 packets are sent to determine the remote OS.  - Can detect whether the host is up, so pinging is no longer necessary.  - Stealthier: Does not send any malformed datagrams.  - Can distinguish between many variants of Microsoft operating systems.

>&#13;GL(Mesa) screenhacks for xscreensaver These are some extra hacks for xscreensaver that use the Mesa OpenGL-compatible library. They are included as an extra package so the base package doesn't require Mesa. In addition, these hacks function nicely as GL demos for people who want to try out hardware accelerated 3D with XFree86 4.x From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading and deleting individual files using an FTP client.  sitecopy will also optionally try to spot files you move locally, and move them remotely. sitecopy is designed to not care about what is actually on the remote server - it simply keeps a record of what it THINKS is in on the remote server, and works from that.

>&#13;Allow users to run commands as root, after prompting for password. xsu is an interface for the command `su - username -c command` in Gnome. When the user executes xsu, he/she will be prompted for a command, a username and a password. If the username and password are correct xsu will execute the command as the entered user. So if the username was root, then the command will be executed as root. Of course it's also possible to predefine the username and the command by using the [-u,--username] and [-c,--command] arguments at the command line of xsu. This can be very useful when using xsu in for example gmenu or the GNOME panel. * Security Gnome Xsu 2.0 uses the standard su binary to gain it's root access. This way, all security issues should be solved. The security of all older xsu versions was very bad. With xsu version 0.1.0 the use of a pipe to a secured non-Gnome SUID application was introduced. This has been replaced with a special type of pipe to the standard GNU su application from the 'login' package. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;provides tide and current predictions XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated, or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop. XTide can work with the X window system, plain text terminals, or the web. This is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive interface (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the web interface (xttpd). The algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is the one used by the National Ocean Service in the U.S. It is significantly more accurate than the simple tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores. However, it takes more to predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm -- you also need data for every location for which you want to predict tides. This package provide a sample data set for only one location so you can try out the package, but anything useful requires the data packaged in the xtide-data package (or downloaded from the XTide ftp site).

It features cassette, floppy, and hard drive emulation, timer interrupt emulation, file import and export from the host operating system, support for most of the undocumented Z-80 instructions, and a built-in debugger.  Real floppy drives can be used, and, if an OSS-compatible sound driver is available, application-based sound can be played and real cassettes read and written directly through the sound card or via WAVE files.  Several hi-res graphics cards are emulated and, in Model 4/4P mode, mice are supported. There is also real-time clock, sound card, serial port, joystick, and CPU clock speedup emulation. xtrs requires ROM images from the original machines.  The ROMs are copyrighted by Radio Shack and are not freely licensed.  (Exception: in Model 4P mode, a freely licensed boot ROM included with this package can be used to boot a Model 4 operating system from a diskette image.)  Instructions are provided for retrieval of TRS-80 ROM images by those who may legally use them. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing, but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one anyway. This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server environment.

>&#13;X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory. The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use of the X toolkit. If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt, but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt. Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:  - Tektronix 4014 emulation  - Session logging  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window    with the CONTROL key held down.  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys. Features which are supported include:  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX    applications.  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be    scrolled back with a scrollbar.  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for    words and lines.

>&#13;a collection of simple routines to call some X11 functions xwit is a collection of simple routines to call some X11 functions that don't already have any utility commands built around them. The reasoning behind this is that loosely every X function should be accessible from a shell script. For example, XWarpPointer() will move the X pointer, but no utility program exists to do so on those rare occasions when you could really use it.  xwit will also resize, iconify, pop, and move windows given by name or id, change an icon, title or name, set the screen saver going, and change individual key autorepeat settings, etc. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Programming environment and editor for console and X11 Xwpe is an integrated programming and debugging environment similar to Borland's Turbo C and Pascal family. It has many features including the ability to start many compilers, linkers and debuggers from a menu-based interface or using keystrokes. Syntax highlighting is included for many programming languages, and any compiler and debugger can easily be used by the program. When compiling from within xwpe, errors in the source code can be jumped to and swiftly corrected. Variables and the stack can be easily displayed. Setting and unsetting breakpoints can be done directly within the source code. Although it is designed to be a tool for programmers (when invoked as wpe or xwpe), it can also be used as an easy to learn text editor (when invoked as we or xwe). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Picture viewer for X with a thumbnail-based selector xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector. It uses GTK+ and Imlib. Most file formats are supported, and the thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It can also be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file selector. For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv' or `man xzgv' once it's installed. xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures, and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's aspect ratio. It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either. Note that this program is written by the author of the svgalib-based "zgv", and has similar features. Home Page: http://xzgv.browser.org/ From Debian 3.0r0 APT
