>&#13;/T/ 1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes. Used in reply to a question (particularly one asked using The -P convention). In LISP, the constant T means `true', among other things. Some Lisp hackers use `T' and `NIL' instead of `Yes' and `No' almost reflexively. This sometimes causes misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker wants coffee, he may absently respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee; but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead. Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee -- so it is not that big a problem. 2. See time T (also since time T equals minus infinity). 3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for the noun `transaction'. 4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of tee. 5. A dialect of LISP developed at Yale. (There is an intended allusion to NIL, "New Implementation of Lisp", another dialect of Lisp developed for the VAX)  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;display filter for RFC822 messages This program is a filter which shall improve the readability for messages (email and posts) by *hiding* some annoying parts, e.g. mailing list footers, signatures and TOFU as well as squeezing sequences of blank lines or punctuation. TOFU is an acronym that stands for "Text oben, Fullquote unten" (german language) which means the style of sadly so many people that just leave all the quotes in a reply and add some own lines above. This acronym is what gave the script it's name - TOFU Protection. It currently offers hints how to include it within mutt. It should be possible to do similars with other mailers that allow to have a message run through a program before it's displayed. If you have such an mailer I'd be interested if you could let me know of your setup. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs. t1utils is a collection of simple type-1 font manipulation programs. Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a PFA or PFB font. There are currently six programs:  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils            will not help you create one. This version of the t1utils programs has been maintained by Eddie Kohler &#60;eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu&#62; since version 1.5, based on the original code by I. Lee Hetherington.  As such, it is a complete replacement for the t1utils Debian package, which is based on version 1.2 of I. Lee Hetherington's code. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A common vulnerability that hackers use to break into systems is the lack of proper input validation. The problem is that programmers expect users to enter in "proper" input, but fail to check for the case of hostile users carefully crafting input designed to compromise the system. The problems with input validation is that the part of the system that receives the input does not know enough to validate it properly. On the other hand, every single component in the system cannot thoroughly validate input. The concept of "taint" is to mark certain inputs as having been entered by the user. Only a thorough desconstruction/reconstruction of the data removes the taint. Some programming languages, like PERL, automate this tracking. Others, like C, requires manual tracking. Example: Version 4 of PERL has a special alternative interpretter called tainperl that tracks tainted input. Version 5 of PERL has the option "-T" that tracks taint.

>&#13;talk mode
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;n. A feature supported by Unix, ITS, and some other OSes that allows two or more logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation. It combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that written language entails. It is difficult to communicate inflection, though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on writing style in the Prependices for details). Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing, which are not used orally. Some of these are identical to (and probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs since the 1920s. AFAIAC as far as I am concerned AFAIK as far as I know BCNU be seeing you BTW by the way BYE? are you ready to unlink? (this is the standard way to end a talk-mode conversation; the other person types BYE to confirm, or else continues the conversation) CUL see you later ENQ? are you busy? (expects ACK or NAK in return) FOO? are you there? (often used on unexpected links, meaning also "Sorry if I butted in ..." (linker) or "What's up?" (linkee)) FWIW for what it's worth FYI for your information FYA for your amusement GA go ahead (used when two people have tried to type simultaneously; this cedes the right to type to the other) GRMBL grumble (expresses disquiet or disagreement) HELLOP hello? (an instance of the `-P' convention) IIRC if I recall correctly JAM just a minute (equivalent to SEC....) MIN same as JAM NIL no (see NIL) NP no problem O over to you OO over and out / another form of "over to you" (from x/y as "x over y") \ lambda (used in discussing LISPy things) OBTW oh, by the way OTOH on the other hand R U THERE? are you there? SEC wait a second (sometimes written SEC...) SYN Are you busy? (expects ACK, SYN|ACK, or RST in return; this is modeled on the TCP/IP handshake sequence) T yes (see the main entry for T) TNX thanks TNX 1.0E6 thanks a million (humorous) TNXE6 another form of "thanks a million" WRT with regard to, or with respect to. WTF the universal interrogative particle; WTF knows what it means? WTH what the hell? &#60;double newline&#62; When the typing party has finished, he/she types two newlines to signal that he/she is done; this leaves a blank line between `speeches' in the conversation, making it easier to reread the preceding text. &#60;name&#62;: When three or more terminals are linked, it is conventional for each typist to prepend his/her login name or handle and a colon (or a hyphen) to each line to indicate who is typing (some conferencing facilities do this automatically). The login name is often shortened to a unique prefix (possibly a single letter) during a very long conversation. /\/\/\ A giggle or chuckle. On a MUD, this usually means `earthquake fault'. Most of the above sub-jargon is used at both Stanford and MIT. Several of these expressions are also common in email, esp. FYI, FYA, BTW, BCNU, WTF, and CUL. A few other abbreviations have been reported from commercial networks, such as GEnie and CompuServe, where on-line `live' chat including more than two people is common and usually involves a more `social' context, notably the following: &#60;g&#62; grin &#60;gd&#38;r&#62; grinning, ducking, and running BBL be back later BRB be right back HHOJ ha ha only joking HHOK ha ha only kidding HHOS ha ha only serious IMHO in my humble opinion (see IMHO) LOL laughing out loud NHOH Never Heard of Him/Her (often used in initgame) ROTF rolling on the floor ROTFL rolling on the floor laughing AFK away from keyboard b4 before CU l8tr see you later MORF male or female? TTFN ta-ta for now TTYL talk to you later OIC oh, I see rehi hello again Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is common; conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, NIL, and T. The MUD community uses a mixture of Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the `social' list above; specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and WTH. The use of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re- compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see bonk/oif) people. The word `re' by itself is taken as `regreet'. In general, though, MUDders express a preference for typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links. The following uses specific to MUDs are reported: CU l8er see you later (mutant of CU l8tr) FOAD f*** off and die (use of this is generally OTT) OTT over the top (excessive, uncalled for) ppl abbrev for "people" THX thanks (mutant of TNX; clearly this comes in batches of 1138 (the Lucasian K)). UOK? are you OK? Some B1FFisms (notably the variant spelling d00d) appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of MUDders. One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode, often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are typing rather than speaking. This is not the best approach. It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it. It is usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge forward, unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just to type "xxx" and start over from before the mistake.

It provides a graphical user interface consisting of six delay lines, or "taps", which can introduce an almost arbitrarily big or small delay to their inputs and can be feed back to each other. A wide set of effects can be easily achieved by properly configuring and connecting the delay lines: complex echo patterns, resonances, filtering, etc. Delays, interconnections and gains can all be controlled in real time. Tapiir requires the ALSA sound driver. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Tcl (generally pronounced "tickle") is a command language designed and first implemented by John Ousterhout. Tcl is an extensible, interpreted, programming language, which has been ported to a wide range of machines and operating systems. Tk (pronounced "Tee-kay") is an X-windows toolkit for Tcl. It is generally claimed that Tcl/Tk implementations of software require approximately 10 times less code than the corresponding software in C. From Linux Guide @FirstLinux

>&#13;Tcl is a scripting language. It is an easy to learn interpreted language that uses a typeless approach to achieve a higher level of programming and a rapid application development. The Tk toolkit is a programming environment for creating graphical user interf aces (GUI) under X Window System. Their capabilities include the possibility to extend and embed in other application, rapid development and ease of use. Toge ther, Tcl and Tk provide many benefits both to application developer and user. Tk-ba sed interfaces tend to be much more customizable and dynamic than those built with one of the C or C++ based toolkits. Tk implements the Motif look and feel. A great number of interesting X applications are implemented entirely in Tk, with no new application-specific commands at all. From Tcl/Tk HOWTO

>&#13;A lexical analyzer generator for Tcl tcLex is a lexer (lexical analyzer) generator extension to Tcl. It is inspired by Unix and GNU lex and flex, which are "tools for generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text". tcLex is very similar to these programs, except it uses Tcl philosophy and syntax, whereas the others use their own syntax and are used in conjunction with the C language. People used to lex or flex should then feel familiar with tcLex. tcLex is a small extension (the Windows compiled version is about 20kb, and the source is about 150kb), because it extensively uses the Tcl library. However, the current doesn't use Tcl's regexp code anymore but a patched version is now included in tcLex, which makes it slightly bigger (by a few KB). tcLex should work with Tcl 8.0 and later.  tcLex will NEVER work with earlier versions, because it uses Tcl 8.0's "object" system for performance. The most interesting features are:  * cross-platform support, thanks to Tcl. Though it has been    developed on Windows and tested on Windows and Unix only, it    should work on other platforms as long as Tcl exists on these    platforms. Supported Tcl platforms are Windows 95/NT, Unix (Linux,    Solaris...) and Macintosh. Other platforms are VMS, OS/2,    NeXTStep, Amiga...  * unlike lex and flex, which only generate static lexers written in    C and intended to be compiled, tcLex dynamically generates Tcl    commands that can be used like other C commands or Tcl procedures    from within Tcl scripts or C programs.  * it uses Tcl regular expressions. That means you don't have to    learn another regexp language.  * it works with Tcl namespaces  * the generated lexer commands can be used in one pass or    incrementally, because they maintain state information. That way,    several instances of the same lexer (eg a HTML parser) can run at    the same time in distinct call frames and maintain distinct states    (local variables...). Lexer need not be specially designed in    order to be used incrementally, the same lexer can transparently    be used in one pass or incrementally. This feature is especially    useful when processing text from a file or an Internet socket (Web    pages for example), when data is not necessarily available at the    beginning of the processing.

>&#13;Transmission Control Protocol--the big kahoona of the Internet Protocols. TCP takes the information to be generated by an application and passes it to the IP (Internet Protocol) to be transmitted. IP is responsible for getting a packet of information from one host to another, while TCP is responsible for making sure messages get from one host to another and that the messages are understood.

>&#13;Transmission Control Protocol. The chief transport protocol for TCP/IP. Key point: TCP is "connection oriented". This means the three-way handshake must be completed before any data can be sent across the connection. This makes IP address spoofing impossible without sequence number prediction. Key point: TCP creates a virtual "byte stream" for applications. Therefore, applications that send/receive data must create their own boundaries, such as length encoding the data, or send text data a line at a time. However, in practice, applications do indeed send data aligned on packet boundaries. Most network-based intrusion detection systems depend upon these boundaries in order to work correctly. Therefore, they can easily be evaded by custom written scripts that misalign the data. The applications don't see any difference, but the NIDS see something completely different go across the wire that no longer matches their signatures. Contrast: There are two transport protocols: TCP and UDP. Whereas TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless, meaning UDP-based applications are easily spoofed.

Acknowledgement Number^ The next expected sequence number of packets coming in the opposite direction. Reserved^ Not used. Note that this "field" is actually two fields: the low-order bits of the data offset byte and the high-order bits of the flags byte. Key point: The two undefined flags in this field are handled differently by different systems, which allows them to be fingerprinted URG^ The urgent flag is used to send what is known as out-of-band data. Key point: TCP/IP stacks often don't implement this right, and virtually no application uses it either. In fact, the WinNuke DoS attack against Windows was due to the fact that Windows would crash on URG data. ACK^ When set, the Acknowledgement Number field is valid. Key point: This bit is set in every packet but the first one, because every TCP packet acknowledges the last data it received. Key point: In order to block incoming connections, firewalls typically only pay attention to TCP packets with the ACK bit == 0. In other words, by blocking the first packet of a TCP connection, you prevent the connection from being established in the first place. Key point: Hackers can usually send TCP packets through a firewall by setting the ACK bit. Even though hackers cannot connect to a service, they can still do things like port scanning using this technique. PSH^ Normally, TCP tries to coalesce multiple packets into a single packet in order to improve throughput performance (handling one big chunk is more efficient than smaller chunks), but at the cost of latency (after receiving the first chunk, it must wait a little bit to see if a second chunk arrives). This bit tells the stack to push the data though immediately without waiting. RST^ Informs the other side that an error has occurred. This will either drop the connection or set it back to a known state. Key point: Different TCP/IP stacks send resets in response to different conditions, which can be used to fingerprint the stack. SYN^ Begins a connection. The most important consideration is synchronizing the sequence numbers on both sides. See SYN for more information. FIN^ Closes a connection. Key point: If you send a FIN packet to an open port, it should not respond. Some incorrectly written stacks respond anyway, allowing you to fingerprint a system. Key point: IDS systems monitoring network traffic will sometimes kill TCP sessions by spoofing a FIN packet. Thus, when it detects an intruder connected to a server, it will make the server think the intruder has hung-up, and the server will likewise hang-up.  From Hacking-Lexicon

</B

><P
>&#13;When trying to spoof a TCP connection, the intruder is faced with the difficulty that he will never see the response to a SYN packet.. This is a problem because the victim sends back information to the spoofed address that is needed to carry on the conversation, namely the sequence number being used by the victim. Luckily (for hackers), most systems choose sequence numbers in a predictable way. History: Kevin Mitnick was caught doing TCP sequence number prediction against Tsutmu Shimomura. The reason Shimomura was able to catch Mitnick is because in order to predict the next sequence number, you must first grab the previous number using a non-spoofed connection. History: One of the first to point out this security problem was Robert T. Morris in a 1985 paper entitled A Weakness in the 4.2BSD Unix TCP/IP Software. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;TCP flow recorder tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery. However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly. tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured with 'tcpdump -w'.

The problem is that with the widespread use of firewalls on the modern Internet, many of the packets that traceroute(8) sends out end up being filtered, making it impossible to completely trace the path to the destination.  However, in many cases, these firewalls will permit inbound TCP packets to specific ports that hosts sitting behind the firewall are listening for connections on. By sending out TCP SYN packets instead of UDP or ICMP ECHO packets, tcptraceroute is able to bypass the most common firewall filters. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A formal and academic specification of infosec created by the United States Department of Defense in the early 1980s. Point: TCSEC is divided in four parts: A, B, C, and D, where 'A' describes systems with the highest security and 'D' describes untrusted/untrustworthy systems. Each of these is further subdivided into "classes". Microsoft received "C2" certification for Windows NT. This mean the government certified the system as to conforming to class 2 of division C. Contrast: TCSEC is designed around the concept of trusted employees accessing local systems. It was not designed for todays open Internet access. Hackers do not approach security from the TCSEC point of view. TCSEC doesn't deal with types of threats hackers pose. What this means is that the TCSEC approach is irrelevent when trying to defend your e-commerce site against hackers. However, it is extremely useful in protecting internal systems from internal people. Remember that the biggest threat is from your own internal employees, and that most cybercriminals were convicted for having abused trust placed in them. From Hacking-Lexicon

Files created by Ted should be accepted as legal .rtf files.  Compatibility the other way is more difficult to achieve, but Ted will ignore unsupported formatting. Ted supports font properties such as bold, italic and underline, in-line bitmap pictures, postscript printing, tables, and symbols.  It can save documents in HTML format, and comes with built-in spell checking. Ted acts as a MIME handler for the application/rtf MIME type. This version of ted depends on the lesstif libraries.

>&#13;Telnet
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A network protocol that provides a remote command-line shell. Telnet was created in the early 1970s, and is still widely used (as of early 2000). The most common uses of Telnet are to remotely login to UNIX systems. It is also widely used to obtain a command-prompt on network equipment such as routers and switches. Misconception: The word Telnet is the name of both the protocol as well as the client-program that uses the protocol. This client program is built into most systems. Using the Telnet program, you can open up a raw TCP connection to any port on the target computer in order to interact directly with text-based protocols. Thus, when we talk about telnetting to a certain port, we usually are talking about simply opening a raw connection. Indeed, we may be referring to a case where neither the Telnet program nor protocol are being used, such as using netcat to port 80. Example: Telnet to your local SMTP using a command that looks like telnet smtp.example.com 25. The first parameter should be your own mail server, whereas the second parameter indicates which port to connect to (other than the default port 23). Now type in the text as you see it below:

>&#13;An Internet protocol that enables Internet users to log on to another computer linked to the Internet, including those that cannot directly communicate with the internet's TCP/IP protocols. Telnet establishes a "plain vanilla" computer terminal called a network virtual terminal. This capability is frequently used to enable communications with bulletin boards systems (BBSs) and mainframe computers. For example, you will often see hyperlinks so Telnet sessions while browsing the World Wide Web (WWW) . If you click such a hyperlink, your browser starts a Telnet helper program, and you see a text-only command window. In this window, you type commands and see the remote system's responses.

>&#13;Compatibility package for old termcap-based programs. The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based programs. Since libc6-based programs are hopefully "modern" enough to be linked with ncurses (or slang), this package only provides a libc5-based libtermcap library. You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this package if a program (that you cannot recompile) fails to run with the error message "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'" or complains about a missing /etc/termcap file. The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs therefore it doesn't provide all the necessary files for compilation. If you want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.

>&#13;TeTeX is an implementation of TeX for Linux or UNIX systems. TeX takes a text file and a set of formatting commands as input and creates a typesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file as output. Usually, TeX is used in conjunction with a higher level formatting package like LaTeX or PlainTeX, since TeX by itself is not very user-friendly.Install tetex if you want to use the TeX text formatting system. If you are installing tetex, you will also need to install tetex-afm (aPostScript(TM) font converter for TeX), tetex-dvilj (for converting.dvi files to HP PCL format for printing on HP and HP compatible printers), tetex-dvips (for converting .dvi files to PostScript format for printing on PostScript printers), tetex-latex (a higher level formatting package which provides an easier-to-use interface for TeX), and tetex-xdvi (for previewing .dvi files in X). Unless you are anexpert at using TeX, you should also install the tetex-doc package, which includes the documentation for TeX. From Redhat 8.0 RPM

>&#13;/tekh/ n. An extremely powerful macro-based text formatter written by Donald E. Knuth, very popular in the computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix troff, the other favored formatter, even at many Unix installations). TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation, and the correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E depressed below the baseline; the mixed-case `TeX' is considered an acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices). Fans like to proliferate names from the word `TeX' -- such as TeXnician (TeX user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique. See also CrApTeX. Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining quality of the typesetting in volumes I-III of his monumental "Art of Computer Programming" (see Knuth, also bible). In a manifestation of the typical hackish urge to solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to design his own typesetting language. He thought he would finish it on his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years. The language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of "The Art of Computer Programming" is not expected to appear until 2002. The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such that nobody minds this very much. Many grand hackish projects have started as a bit of toolsmithing on the way to something else; Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most. TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but high-quality software. Knuth offers a monetary awards to anyone who found and reported bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years wore on and the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to find), the bribe went up. Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least one bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.

It interacts with TeX-based applications through style files and postprocessors, leaving the processing of the source files to the native TeX compiler. Consequently, TeX4ht can handle the features of TeX-based systems in general, and of LaTeX in particular. TeX4ht can be used both for authoring HTML using TeX/LaTeX input files, or for converting existing TeX input files (in any format) into HTML, with (usually) only minor modifications. You will need imagemagick suite of programs to convert from graphics in DVI files, as output by TeX (via postscript) to GIF, PNG or JPEG files. Alternatively, you could use ghostscript and programs from the netpbm package after adjusting TeX4ht's configuration. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

The editor allows you to write structured documents via a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user friendly interface.  New styles may be created by the user. The program implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you to produce professionally looking documents. The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write your own extensions to the editor. In the future, TeXmacs is planned to evolve towards a complete scientific office suite, with spreadsheet capacities, a technical drawing editor and a presentation mode.

>&#13;This word has multiple senses. Historically, it comes the standard English word meaning that main body of a printed or written work. For example, the text of a letter somebody sent you distinguishes the body of the letter from the envelope or the greeting. In cryptography, the word TEXT means anything you might want to encrypt, where the words plaintext indicates the message before you encrypt it and ciphertext indicates the message after you encrypt it. In other areas of computer science, there is text data and binary data. The phrase "text" generally means human readable data, such as English text, whereas the word binary indicates data that can only be read by the computer. Misunderstanding: We sometimes encrypt binary data, in which case the binary data forms that plain text of the message. Conversely, the body of a binary program that runs is often referred to as the TEXT of the program. In both these particular areas, the word "TEXT" is indicating the oppose meaning of the general usage. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Trivial File Transfer Protocol TFTP is a bare-bones protocol used by devices that boot from the network. It is runs on top of UDP, so it doesn't require a real TCP/IP stack. Misunderstanding: Many people describe TFTP as simply a trivial version of FTP. This misses the point. The purpose of TFTP is not to reduce the complexity of file transfer, but to reduce the complexity of the underlying TCP/IP stack so that it can fit inside boot ROMs. Key point: TFTP is almost always used with BOOTP. BOOTP first configures the device, then TFTP transfers the boot image named by BOOTP. Key point: Many systems come with unnecessary TFTP servers. Many TFTP servers have bugs, like the backtracking problem or buffer overflows. As a consequence, many systems can be exploited with TFTP even though virtually nobody really uses it. Key point: A TFTP file transfer client is built into many operating systems (UNIX, Windows, etc.). These clients are often used to download rootkits when being broken into. Therefore, removing the TFTP client should be part of your hardening procedure. From Hacking-Lexicon

A multithreaded program can run much faster than a monolithic, or single-threaded, program because several, or even many, different tasks can be performed concurrently, rather than serially (sequentially).

Please read /usr/share/doc/tidev-source/README.Debian for more informations on how to achieve that. You must have the parport driver built either in your kernel or as a module to use the tipar_dev driver. You need a kernel with the USB core to use the tiusb_dev driver.

>&#13;A team of "white-hats" attack and secure systems. Some of these teams are given the task to penetrate the systems, other are just to review security procedures with an eye of how they might be penetrated. This is a favorite of government and paranoid organizations. Controversy: Tiger teams aren't afraid of prosecution and start with a greater degree of knowledge about the victim. Therefore, many people argue whether a successful penetration by a tiger team reflects a real-world scenario. For example, if you don't fear prosecution, then you might simply do a physical break-in. A physical break-in will always result in a successful "hack" because you can install keystroke loggers, password sniffers, or simply steal disk drives. Controversy: There are some cases where tiger teams have actually stolen sensitive information. History: This originally a military term, where teams would enter secure installations and leave behind notes like "bomb" or "theft" in sensitive areas to prove that they had been there, and that they could have left behind bombs or stolen secret plans.

The TiK client began its life as a scaled down version of the native Windows and Macintosh clients. However, TiK now has most of the features the native clients have, plus some extras. TiK includes a graphical buddy list display plus packages for away messages, buddy pounce, buddy ticker, and im capturing. It is very easy for end users to add new features to TiK, using Tcl/Tk. TiK is meant to give UNIX users an alternative to the Java client. This release of TiK requires Tcl/Tk 8.1 or greater, unlike the previous releases, which only required 8.0 or greater.

>&#13;A TI calculator &#60;-&#62; PC communication program for X TiLP is a Texas Instruments calculator &#60;-&#62; PC communication program for Linux. It is able to use any type of link, like the original TI GRAPH-LINK (both black and grey cables), the homemade "$4 serial link", or the "$5 parallel link". It even supports the new TI GraphLink USB, using the tiglusb kernel module. See http://lpg.ticalc.org/. With TiLP, you can transfer files from your PC to your Texas Instruments calculator, and vice-versa. You can also make a screen dump, a backup, transfer a backup to the calculator, or take control of your TI from your PC, or even install a new version of AMS on your calc ! You might be interested in the tidev-modules-source package which allows you to build a set of three kernel modules. These modules are three drivers for different link cables (serial, parallel, USB) which require running TiLP with root privileges. With these modules loaded and the appropriate rights on the device nodes, this won't be necessary. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;System for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and derived from the tsipa package, made in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and Shirakawa Shun. Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as compared with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA symbols:   * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which     includes all the symbols and diacritics found in the recent     versions of IPA and some non-IPA symbols.   * Complete support of LaTeX2e.   * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles.   * Easy input method in the IPA environment.   * Extended macros for accents and diacritics.   * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'.   * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams.   * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with     Times Roman and Helvetica fonts. Type 1 fonts for TIPA are also included in this package. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;X Window System mail reader using Tcl/Tk This is an X Window System interface to mail built using Tcl/Tk. Reading, sending, and managing mail messages can almost all be done using only the mouse (except for the body of the message, of course). TkMail writes its folders in the format of the standard unix 'mail' command. It also uses 'sendmail' commands to do the mail delivery work.  Major Features:  - listbox interface to messages for easy click and read  - multiple viewers can be opened on different or the same folder  - dynamic (at startup) menus for quick access to mail folders    for reading, copying, and moving messages  - button bar for quick composing, replying to, and forwarding of    mail messages  - built in 'biff' icon for notification of new mail on    multiple folders  - easy inclusion of files into message compositions with    automatic uuencoding and compression, if desired  - access alternate editor for compositions to send  - spell check compositions using a X windows interface  - reads aliases from either standard .mailrc or elm aliases.txt  - easy piping of message text through unix filters  - emacs-like key-bindings for text editing  - emacs-like autosave  - sorting of messages on any field and the ability to    write out the folder physically in that order From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;a cross-platform makefile tool tmake is an easy-to-use tool from Trolltech to create and maintain makefiles for software projects.  It can be a painful task to manage makefiles manually, especially if you develop for more than one platform or use more than one compiler.  tmake automates and streamlines this process and lets you spend your valuable time on writing code, not makefiles. tmake is mainly used to generate makefiles for applications that use the Qt toolkit.

>&#13;Cleans up files in directories based on their age This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir() across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special files unless given a command line option enabling it to. WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment. The daily tmpreaper run can be configured through /etc/tmpreaper.conf . From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;vt. To change a bit from whatever state it is in to the other state; to change from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1. This comes from `toggle switches', such as standard light switches, though the word `toggle' actually refers to the mechanism that keeps the switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than to the fact that the switch has two positions. There are four things you can do to a bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or zero) it, leave it alone, or toggle it. (Mathematically, one would say that there are four distinct boolean-valued functions of one boolean argument, but saying that is much less fun than talking about toggling bits.)

Because of patent issues surrounding the layer 3 encoder, the ability of most mpeg audio players to play layer 2 files, and the similarity in command-line syntax, toolame makes a very good drop-in replacement for lame or other layer 3 encoders under most circumstances.

But finding the way by using elevators and walking through a maze of doors and platforms is not the only problem you have to solve. There are a bunch of other creatures living on the tower that will hinder you to reach your target by pushing you over the edge of the platforms. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

><DD
><P
>&#13;Traceroute is a command built into most systems that traces the path through the Internet between two points (on Windows, it is known as "tracert"). Every IP packet on the Internet has a Time-to-Live field. Each router subtracts one from this field when it forwards the packet. This was designed to solve the problem of "routing loops": routers get confused as to the proper network topology and end up routing packets in an infinite loop. The TTL field guarantees that these packets will eventually die on their own accord. When a packet dies in this fashion, the last router to see the packet sends a diagnostic message back to the sender informing of this fact. Consequently (and this is the genius part), you can purposely create small TTLs that are guaranteed to kill the packet. You set the TTL field first to 1, causing the first router to drop it and inform you. You set the TTL field to 2, causing the second router to drop it. You do this for all TTL values, getting back a notification from each router in the network, thus mapping the route between two points. From Hacking-Lexicon

To cause a trap. "These instructions trap to the monitor." Also used transitively to indicate the cause of the trap. "The monitor traps all input/output instructions." This term is associated with assembler programming (`interrupt' or `exception' is more common among HLL programmers) and appears to be fading into history among programmers as the role of assembler continues to shrink. However, it is still important to computer architects and systems hackers (see system, sense 1), who use it to distinguish deterministically repeatable exceptions from timing-dependent ones (such as I/O interrupts).

>&#13;[Biology] Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood TREE-PUZZLE (the new name for PUZZLE) is an interactive console program that implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows analysis of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of support to each internal branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user specified trees. Branch lengths can also be calculated under the clock-assumption. In addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood mapping, to investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without computing an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content of a sequence alignment.

>&#13;Triple DES (3DES, 3DES_EDE)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A stronger form of DES where the algorithm is applied three times in order to encrypt data. Triple DES became necessary in the later part of the 20th century because DES had become so weak (a $200k machine was able to decrypt a DES encrypted message in hours). At that time, the new AES replacement had not yet appeared. In order to leverage DES hardware/software products, it was decided just to use DES three times with multiple keys. Point: Triple DES runs in "E-D-E" mode where it encrypts the data with the first key, then decrypts it with the second key, then encrypts with the third key. The second "decryption" phase is really just an encryption step: it is only by convention that one direction is considered encryption and the other direction decryption. The reason this technique is chosen is that if the same key is supplied three times, the effect is the same as a single encryption step. Controversy: The NSA urged banks not to adopt Triple-DES as a standard, citing national security concerns. They instead urged banks to adopt the Clipper chip. The banks went with Triple-DES in ANSI X9.52. In fact, as of 1998, several countries mandated the use of Triple-DES (replacing DES) in financial transactions. Controversy: Simply tripling the encryption does not necessarily triple its strength. For example, there are many crypto algorithms whereby encrypting with two different keys simply means you can decrypt with a single third key. Many suspect that tripling DES only doubles is cryptographic strength. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Tripwire is a tool that detects when files have been altered by regularly recalculating hashes of them and storing the hashes in a secure location. The product triggers when changes to the files have been detected. By using cryptographic hashes, tripwire is often able to detect subtle changes. Contrast: The simplistic form of tripwire is to check file size and last modification time. However, programs that change files (like viruses) will often keep these the same. On the other hand, keeping complete backups would require too much space. Therefore, cryptographic hashes are used. Contrast: The cryptographic hash calculated from the file is often known as a "fingerprint" or "signature". However, these terms have completely different meanings in other areas of security, so some people just say "hash" or "checksum". History: The original tool was published in 1992 for Unix. The company Tripwire Inc. was formed in 1998. Point: Reasons why files change: Replace common system programs with duplicates contains backdoors. Change configuration files to allow intruder back into the system. Alter system logfiles in order to cover tracks. Alter data files (such as financial records or school grades). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;troff

><P
>&#13;/T'rof/ or /trof/ n. [Unix] The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and phototypesetting program, written originally in PDP-11 assembler and then in barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after the Multics and CTSS program RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (that name came from the expression "to run off a copy"). A companion program, nroff, formats output for terminals and line printers. In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT. His paper describing that work ("A Typesetter-independent troff," AT&#38;T CSTR #97) explains troff's durability. After discussing the program's "obvious deficiencies -- a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious and undocumented properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite for computer resources" and noting the ugliness and extreme hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan concludes: None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating Ossanna's accomplishment with TROFF. It has proven a remarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors and being forced into uses that were never conceived of in the original design, all with considerable grace under fire. The success of TeX and desktop publishing systems have reduced troff's relative importance, but this tribute perfectly captures the strengths that secured troff a place in hacker folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an indication of those qualities of good programs that, in the long run, hackers most admire.

>&#13;trojan
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A class of malware, the word trojan refers to the classic Trojan Horse from the Iliad. In this story, after giving up on sieging the fortified city of Troy, the Greeks left behind a present. This consisted of a large wooden horse left at the outskirts of the town. After seeing the Greeks sail off, the citizens brought the wooden horse into town. The horse contained Greek warriors, who promptly jumped out, killed a bunch of people, and opened the city gates, letting in the Greek army who had actually been hiding rather than sailing off with the ships. Trojans are one of the leading causes of breaking into machines. If you pull down a program from a chat room, new group, or even from unsolicited e-mail, then the program is likely trojaned with some subversive purpose. It might contain a virus, a password-grabber, or consist of a remote admin trojan designed to allow remote control over your machine. Contrast: Whereas the general popular uses the word virus to refer to any malware, a Trojan is not technically a virus. Generally, Trojans do not spread to other programs or other machines. Key point: The word can be used as a verb. To trojan a program is to add subversive functionality to an existing program. For example, a trojaned login program might be programmed to accept a certain password for any user's account that the hacker can use to log back into the system at any time. Rootkits often contain a suite of such trojaned programs. Key point: Users can often break into a system by leaving behind trojaned command programs in directories (like their own directory or the /tmp directory). If you copy your own ls program to the /tmp directory, and somebody else does a cd /tmp then an ls, that user will run your program with their own privileges. This is especially dangerous against root, which is why the local directory should not be part of the search path for the root account. Contrast: A big fear is the transitive trojan -- a trojan horse that generates other trojans. The best example is the trojan described by Ken Thompson. He put a trojan horse into the C compiler so that when the login code was compiled, it would always accept a backdoor password. A common technique to guard against that is to first recompile the compiler first. Thompson therefore trojaned the compiler so that when it recompiled itself, it would put back the trojan. Therefore, even when you had the complete source to UNIX and compiler, you still couldn't recompile from scratch and remove the trojan. The fear is that tool vendors might put such trojans in their compilers, which cause products made from those compilers to have backdoors. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;A computer program is either hidden inside another program or that masquerades as something it is not in order to trick potential users into running it. For example a program that appears to be a game or image file but in reality performs some other function. The term "Trojan Horse" comes from a possibly mythical ruse of war used by the Greeks sometime between 1500 and 1200 B.C. A Trojan Horse computer program may spread itself by sending copies of itself from the host computer to other computers, but unlike a virus it will (usually) not infect other programs. From Matisse

>&#13;Advanced permission management system for Linux. The main goal of Linux trustees project is to create an advanced permission management system for linux. In fact, UNIX permission system is not suitable for solution of very common tasks. E.g., let a system administrator wants to create a directory that available for some groups in write mode, for another groups - in read only. The files in the directory and subdirectories should inherits the parent's behavior, unless other is stated explicitly. Using standard UNIX (and Linux) security model it is generally speaking impossible to implement the situation when different groups have read/write and read/only permissions. This issue can be resolved by ext2-fs ACL project, but the problem is that nobody wants to copy mask or ACLs from parent directory to subdirectories either by hands or using special scripts. Using the trustees, you can resolve this problems just typing [/device]/path:+group1:REBX The solution proposed is mainly inspired by Novell Netware approach and Java security API. Special objects (called trustees) can be bounded to every file or directory. Trustee object means that access to file or directory or directory with subdirectories is granted (or denied) to certain user or group (or all except user or group). This package provides settrustee utility, which enables new privileges from trustee.conf. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;A way of establishing an outbound connection through a firewall in such a way that it is neither blocked or monitored. This isn't a way of breaking through a firewall, but assuming you've compromised a machine on the other side of a firewall (through some other technique), this will allow you to communicate with that machine from the Internet. It is also used by people behind firewalls that use restrictive rulesets: users simply create a tunnel back to their home machine. Example: People have written tunnels over ICMP, DNS, HTTP, e-mail messages, and TCP connections. Tunnels can either by of the "port redirector" style (which run on top of any TCP/IP stack) or of the network interface variety (below the TCP/IP stack requiring kernel mod). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;Encrypted network connection within a TCP/IP connection Tunnel Vision creates a "virtual" TCP/IP network (VPN) between two Tunnel Vision-capable sites on the internet.  It uses the strongest encryption that's actually useful (1024-bit RSA and 128-bit Blowfish) to protect your data along the way.  This connection between two TV servers is called a "tunnel." Tunnel Vision is usually used on a router or gateway machine.  When someone on your network wants to send data to someone on the other side of the tunnel, it sends through the default gateway (the TV server) like it normally would.  You configure the TV server to send data through the tunnel instead of just forwarding it onto the internet. Tunnel Vision requires Linux 2.1.122 or higher with the ethertap and netlink devices.

>&#13;Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of Linux, This eventuated after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus Torvalds endorsed the idea of a penguin logo in a couple of famously funny postings. Linus explained that he was once bitten by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a special affinity for the species ever since. (Linus has since admitted that he was also thinking of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel thief who appeared in a Wallace &#38; Grommit feature cartoon, "The Wrong Trousers".) Larry Ewing designed the official Tux logo. It has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of recognizable variations used as emblems of Linux-related projects, products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology, of which the Gospel According to Tux and the mock-epic poem "Tuxowolf" are among the best-known examples. There is a `real' Tux - a black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol Zoo. Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a birthday present in 1996.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;n. 1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, ~). Also called `squiggle', `sqiggle' (sic -- pronounced /skig'l/), and `twaddle', but twiddle is the most common term. 2. A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually fixes one bug and generates several new ones (see also shotgun debugging). 3. vt. To change something in a small way. Bits, for example, are often twiddled. Twiddling a switch or knobs implies much less sense of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see frobnicate. To speak of twiddling a bit connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't specify what you're doing to the bit; `toggling a bit' has a more specific meaning (see bit twiddling, toggle). 4. Uncommon name for the twirling baton prompt.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;The Web Information Gateway TWIG is a groupware client designed to be used with web browsers. The main goal was to provide an IMAP client, but it now offers agenda, news-reader, bookmarks, contact list and other features. TWIG can be used as a webmail app with remote mail and news servers, so these are not needed in the local machine. This package is prepared to be used with either MySQL or PostgreSQL, but it is possible to use it with many other databases if properly configured.

><P
>&#13;n. [PLATO] The overstrike sequence -/|\-/|\- which produces an animated twirling baton. If you output it with a single backspace between characters, the baton spins in place. If you output the sequence BS SP between characters, the baton spins from left to right. If you output BS SP BS BS between characters, the baton spins from right to left. This is also occasionally called a twiddle prompt. The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature files on the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system. The archie Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton program today; it uses the twirling baton as an idler indicating that the program is working on a query. The twirling baton is also used as a boot progress indicator on several BSD variants of Unix; if it stops you're probably going to have a long and trying day.  From Jargon Dictionary

The interface can be customized without re-compiling.  A resource file allows you to modify the menus for the bands, modes, etc. that you use. Most of the log entries can be made with a button press or a single key stroke.  It records the date, start and end times, call sign, band, mode, power, and signal reports.  There is also a field for general notes. A second window allows you to search and edit the log file, and a third window provides online help.  The help file can also be view with any unix command or editor at any time. From Debian 3.0r0 APT
