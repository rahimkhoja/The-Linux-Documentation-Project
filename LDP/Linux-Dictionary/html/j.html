>&#13;Rip and encode CDs with one command Jack has been developed with one main goal: making MP3s or OGGs without having to worry. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip goes unnoticed, e.g. jack compares WAV and OGG file sizes when continuing from a previous run. Jack also checks your HD space before doing anything (even keeps some MB free). Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:  - it supports different rippers and encoders  - it is very configurable  - it doesn't need X  - it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by cdrdao  - when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed    for all tracks, so you can see if something went wrong  - it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules it's    ripping/encoding processes depending on available space.  - freedb query, file renaming and id3 tagging  - it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have    been ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want    to do a freedb query.  - it can do a freedb query based on OGGs alone, like if you don't    remember from which CD those OGGs came from.  - freedb submissions From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;An object-oriented language originally developed at Sun by James Gosling (and known by the name "Oak") with the intention of being the successor to C++ (the project was however originally sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in set-top boxes). After the great Internet explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a byte-interpreted language and became the focus of a relentless hype campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new language of choice for distributed applications. Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been embraced by many in the hacker community - but it has been a considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging from uneven support on different Web browser platforms, performance issues, and some notorious deficiencies of some of the standard toolkits (AWT in particular). Microsoft's determined attempts to corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly) have not helped. As of 1999, these issues are still in the process of being resolved. Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet, and no other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the limelight the way Java has). On the other hand, Java has already been a big win in academic circles, where it has taken the place of Pascal as the preferred tool for teaching the basics of good programming to the next generation of hackers.

Java is often used to build large, complex systems that involve several different computers interacting across networks, for example transaction processing systems. Java is also becoming popular for creating programs that run in small electronic devicws, such as mobile telephones. A very common use of Java is to create programs that can be safely downloaded to your computer through the Internet and immediately run without fear of viruses or other harm to your computer or files. Using small Java programs (called "Applets"), Web pages can include functions such as animations,calculators, and other fancy tricks. From Matisse

>&#13;/J-C-L/ n. 1. IBM's supremely rude Job Control Language. JCL is the script language used to control the execution of programs in IBM's batch systems. JCL has a very fascist syntax, and some versions will, for example, barf if two spaces appear where it expects one. Most programmers confronted with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the file names. Someone who actually understands and generates unique JCL is regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who memorizes the phone book. It is reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing "Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles you and me? I-B-M, J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e" to the tune of the "Mickey Mouse Club" theme to express their opinion of the beast. 2. A comparative for any very rude software that a hacker is expected to use. "That's as bad as JCL." As with COBOL, JCL is often used as an archetype of ugliness even by those who haven't experienced it. See also IBM, fear and loathing. A (poorly documented, naturally) shell simulating JCL syntax is available at the Retrocomputing Museum http://www.ccil.org/retro.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;A redirector for Squid Jesred is a very fast and highly configurable redirector for the Squid Internet Object Cache. It was derived from Chris Foote's and Wayne Piekarski's Squirm 1.0 betaB and some code from Squid itself, but is about 2-3x faster than the original version and has some additional features. Jesred has the following features:   * uses only a very small amount of memory (a little bit more than     squirm 1.0 betaB, but still less than perl ;-))   * able to rewrite GET and optionally ICP_QUERY requests as well   * one global configuration file   * one IP access control file which supports CIDR notation only     (i.e. subnet/mask). Thus only URL requests from the specified   * subnets/clients are rewritten, if necessary.   * one rewrite rules configuration file (regular expression matching     and replacement)   * optionally logging of common and error messages to a file   * optionally logging of URL rewrites to a separate log file,     incl. the number of the rule, which has been used to rewrite the     URL   * able to re-read all its configuration files on the fly by sending     a HUP signal to the process. That's why there is no need to     restart Squid, if you want to:       1.change the used log file name[s] (useful for log file rotation)       2.enable/disable logging       3.enable/disable debug mode if compiled with DEBUG option       4.enable/disable URL rewriting of ICP_QUERY (sibling) requests       5.change the IP access patterns       6.change the redirect rules   * If you mess up configuration file[s], Jesred runs in Echo Mode     (always echos back a newline - i.e. no URL replacement) and squid     keeps working.

>&#13;Visualization for nec-based antenna designs It is never been easier to design antennas!  Most hams enjoy ``fiddling'' with antennas, but comparatively few of us are really interested in doing one-handed chin-ups at fifty feet above the cold frozen earth on a snowy and windy night in January. Jiffy will make life a lot easier for you. It can make a drawing from the antenna design that you made and it can display elevation and azimuth patterns from the nec output. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Visualization for nec-based antenna designs using perl-tk Another version of jiffy, which uses perl-tk. Compared to the original jiffy, a program called necview is added, which can view your antenna design from different angles. A major advantage of this version of jiffy as compared to the tcl/tk/blt based version: it's a lot faster. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Download Debian CD images from any Debian mirror Using the jigdo-lite script contained in this package, you can use your nearest "regular" Debian mirror to download Debian CD images, instead of having to use one of the few, slow, overloaded mirrors that offer the images as direct HTTP or FTP downloads. See &#60;http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/&#62; for details. Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a scheme developed primarily to make it easy to distribute huge filesystem images (e.g. CD (ISO9660) or DVD (UDF) images) over the internet, but it could also be used for other data which is awkward to handle due to its size, like audio/video files or large software packages. jigdo tries to ensure that the large file is downloaded in small parts which can be stored on different servers. People who want to download the image do so by telling the jigdo download tool to process one ".jigdo" file; using it, jigdo downloads the parts and reassembles the image. jigdo-file is used to prepare the files for download.

>&#13;Fast Java compiler adhering to language and VM specifications Jikes is a Java compiler that translates Java source files as defined in The Java Language Specification (Addison-Wesley, 1996) into the bytecoded instruction set and binary format defined in The Java Virtual Machine Specification (Addison-Wesley, 1996). Unlike other compilers, Jikes accepts the Java language only as specified: not as a subset, variant, or superset. In addition to strictly adhering to specifications, Jikes is faster than most compilers and can compute the complete dependency relations in program files. This allows for the generation of dependency makefiles suitable for use with make. Jikes can also be run in incremental mode: after the initial compilation, Jikes waits until prompted, determines which files have been changed, and then does the minimal amount of work needed to bring the class files into a complete and consistent state. This cycle can be repeated until the q command is entered to end the compilation. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;Jikes Parser Generator Jikes Parser Generator is a parser generator that accepts as input an annotated  description for a language grammar and produces text files suitable for inclusion in a parser for that language. It is similar in function and use to the widely-available parser generators Yacc and Bison. It also provides support for automatic diagnosis and recovery from syntactic errors. It is the parser generator used by the Jikes Compiler. Jikes Parser Generator can generate parsers for LALR(k) grammars and produce output suitable for use with parsers written in Java, C, or C++.

>&#13;A cross-platform make tool written in Java jmk is an application which is used to ensure that a set of files is in a consistent state. If jmk detects an inconsistency, it executes commands that correct the inconsistency. The rules used to detect and correct inconsistencies are given in a makefile. jmk is designed to support the task of writing platform independent makefiles. File names and path lists are written in a canonical form, and translated by jmk into native form. The rules given in a jmk makefile can invoke programs as separate processes. To produce a machine independent makefile, a makefile should only invoke programs that use the same command line argument syntax across platforms. Examples of such programs include Sun's Java compiler (javac) and their Java Archive Tool (jar). From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;user friendly full screen text editor Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search system.  It also has six help reference cards which are always available, and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface. Joe has a great screen update optimization algorithm, multiple windows (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting, filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing a pipe into or out of a command, and block move, copy, delete or filter. Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete immitation of WordStar, and a restricted mode version (lets you edit only the files specified on the command line).  Joe also has a deferred screen update to handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not bypassed by tty buffering.  It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work on any kind of sane terminal. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;playlist editor / player frontend Juice is a frontend for mpg123 and other players. It provides a nifty dialog-based playlist editor. It basically allows you to browse through your files in a "Midnight Commander"-like fashion. The MP3's you select are treated as a playlist which can be shuffled, rearranged, saved, etc. In order to play audio files, two player interfaces are provided. The mpg123-specific interface uses the remote protocol of mpg123 (This feature was introduced in version 0.59r in order to accommodate generic frontends.) The other player frontend is generic and allows for any player to be used. This is useful if you do not want to limit the functionality of juice to MP3's. Please note that this generic frontend is still in early beta phase and is pretty buggy. Of course juice comes with all the bells &#38; whistles you'd expect from a quality application and has (among others) full integrated help functionality as well as full dialog based configuration file editor.

>&#13;Python seamlessly integrated with Java Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language Python seamlessly integrated with the Java platform.  The predecessor to Jython, JPython, is certified as 100% Pure Java. Jython is complementary to Java and allows the two languages to be freely mixed.  It is especially suited for embedded scripting, interactive experimentation and rapid application development, and it can interact with Java packages or with running Java applications.
