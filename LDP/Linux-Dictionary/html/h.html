>&#13;[very common] 1. n. Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well. 2. n. An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece of work that produces exactly what is needed. 3. vt. To bear emotionally or physically. "I can't hack this heat!" 4. vt. To work on something (typically a program). In an immediate sense: "What are you doing?" "I'm hacking TECO." In a general (time-extended) sense: "What do you do around here?" "I hack TECO." More generally, "I hack `foo'" is roughly equivalent to "`foo' is my major interest (or project)". "I hack solid-state physics." See Hacking X for Y. 5. vt. To pull a prank on. See sense 2 and hacker (sense 5). 6. vi. To interact with a computer in a playful and exploratory rather than goal-directed way. "Whatcha up to?" "Oh, just hacking." 7. n. Short for hacker. 8. See nethack. 9. [MIT] v. To explore the basements, roof ledges, and steam tunnels of a large, institutional building, to the dismay of Physical Plant workers and (since this is usually performed at educational institutions) the Campus Police. This activity has been found to be eerily similar to playing adventure games such as Dungeons and Dragons and Zork. See also vadding. Constructions on this term abound. They include `happy hacking' (a farewell), `how's hacking?' (a friendly greeting among hackers) and `hack, hack' (a fairly content-free but friendly comment, often used as a temporary farewell). For more on this totipotent term see "The Meaning of Hack". See also neat hack, real hack. From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;n. [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. A person capable of appreciating hack value. 4. A person who is good at programming quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker. The term `hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see the network and Internet address). For discussion of some of the basics of this culture, see the How To Become A Hacker FAQ. It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see hacker ethic). It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled bogus). See also wannabee. This term seems to have been first adopted as a badge in the 1960s by the hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab. We have a report that it was used in a sense close to this entry's by teenage radio hams and electronics tinkerers in the mid-1950s.  From Jargon Dictionary

>&#13;hacker (hacking)
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A hacker is someone who is able to manipulate the inner workings of computers, information, and technology. Consider Arthur C. Clark's Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". Since normal people have no clue as to how computers work, they often view hackers with suspicion and awe (as magicians, sorcerers, witches, and warlocks). This suspicion leads to the word "hacker" having the connotation of someone up to no good. History: The word "hacker" started out in the 14th century to mean somebody who was inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity (such as a golf hacker). In the 1970s, the word "hacker" was used by computer enthusiasts to refer to themselves. This reflected the way enthusiasts approach computers: they eschew formal education and play around with the computer until they can get it to work. (In much the same way, a golf hacker keeps hacking at the golf ball until they get it in the hole). Furthermore, as "experts" learn about the technology, the more they realize how much they don't know (especially about the implications of technology). When experts refer to themselves as "hackers", they are making a Socratic statement that they truly know nothing. For more information on this connotation, see ESR's computer enthusiast "Jargon File". Key point: Today if you do a quick search of "hacker" in a search engine, you will still occasional uses of the word in senses used in the 1400s and 1970s, but the overwhelming usage in the 1990s describes people who break into computers using their sorcerous ways. Likewise, the vast majority of websites with the word "hack" in their title refer to illegitimate entry into computer systems, with notable exceptions like http://www.hacker.com/ (for golf). Controversy: The computer-enthusiast community does not like using "hacker" to describe malicious people; they prefer "cracker". The security-community restricts the use of the word "cracker" to some who breaks encryption and copy-protection schemes. Consequently, a journalist who writes about cybercriminals cannot use either word without hate mail from the opposing community claiming they are using the word incorrectly. If a journalists writes about hackers breaking into computers, they will receive hate-mail claiming that not all hackers are malicious, and the that the correct word is "cracker". Likewise, if they write about crackers breaking into computers, they will receive hate-mail claiming that crackers only break codes, but its hackers who break into systems. The best choice probably depends upon the audience; for example one should definitely talk about malicious crackers in a computer-enthusiast magazine like Linux Today. From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;hacker ethic
</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;n. 1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away open-source software. A few go further and assert that all information should be free and any proprietary control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the GNU project. Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But the belief that `ethical' cracking excludes destruction at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also samurai). On this view, it may be one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a superuser account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged -- acting as an unpaid (and unsolicited) tiger team. The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers. Huge cooperative networks such as Usenet, FidoNet and Internet (see Internet address) can function without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

>&#13;UNIX allows the data of a file to have more than one name in separate places in the same file system. Such a file with more than one name for the same data is called a hard-linked file and is similar to a symbolic link. Try touch mydata; ln mydata mydataB; ls -al. The files mydata and mydataB are indistinguishable. They share the same data, and have a 2 in second column of the ls -al listing. This means that they are hard-linked twice (that there are two names for this file).  The reason why hard links are sometimes used in preference to symbolic links is that some programs are not fooled by a symbolic link: If you have, say, a script that uses cp to copy a file, it will copy the symbolic link instead of the file it points to. [ cp actually has an option to override this behavior.] A hard link, however, will always be seen as a real file. On the other hand, hard links cannot be made between files on different file systems nor can they be made between directories. From Rute-Users-Guide

><P
>&#13;The word "harden" implies putting a shell around a computer in order to protect it from intruders. In order to harden a system, you should consider the following techniques: Patch the OS with the latest security fixes. For example, when the "ping-of-death" DoS attack came out, many people needed to patch their TCP/IP stacks to defend against it. Patch the exposed services with the latest security fixes. For example, many third-party mail servers have been vulnerable to buffer overflow exploits. These are normally fixed a few weeks after being published in the hacker community. Therefore, you need to regularly check with the software vendor for the latest patch. Remove all defaults. In order to make their software easy-to-use, vendors include default accounts, default passwords, and samples. However, these can generally be exploited by hackers. You MUST read security guidelines for the particular OS or software package (especially web-server) and carefully remove these defaults/samples, or your box WILL be hacked. For example, most Microsoft IIS 4 web-servers can be compromised with either the .htr buffer overflow or RDO exploits, because webmasters forget (or don't know) to turn them off. Remove all unnecessary services. For example, most Sun Solaris based systems can be hacked through the RPC services. Install packet filtering software. From Hacking-Lexicon

</B

><DD
><P
>&#13;A crytographic operation where an entire message is run through some mathematical operations resulting in a fixed-length (e.g. 128-bit) string that is probably unique. This "hash" has two important properties: It is "one-way"; given a hash, somebody cannot figure out what input message generated the output hash. It is unique; there is more chance of an asteroid hitting the earth and wiping out all life than two messages accidentally hashing to the same value. No two messages should produce the same Example: Some common uses of hashes are: Creating an encryption key from a text password. Creating a unique "fingerprint" of a message that is then encrypted with a private key in order to sign a message. Create unique fingerprints of files in order to detect when they have changed. Example: The program "tripwire" detects intrusions by calculating a hash of all programs/binaries. On a regular basis, it recalculates the hash. If a file has changed, then the hash will also have changed. Tripwire then "trips" whenever the latest calculated hash of the file does not match the one stored in its database. Example: Some common hash algorithms are: SHA-1 If you need to choose a hash algorithm, this is probably the best one to choose (unless speed is the paramount concern). Of the most popular hash algorithms, this is currently (year 2001) considered to be the most secure. MD5 In the year 2001, more data is probably being hashed by MD5 than any other algorithm. However, a lot of people recommend moving to SHA-1 because of weaknesses discovered in MD5. RIPEMD MD4 A historically significant hash algorithm, but useless by today's standards.

>&#13;Customizable high-resolution Pacman clone You have three lives, and you lose a life if you get eaten by a ghost. If you eat all the little dots on a level, you go onto the next level (if we've bothered including any). At the edge of the screen there may be passageways apparently going nowhere - if you follow one you will wrap all the way around and appear at the other side of the screen, yes - really, as if by magic you have been transported from one side of the screen to the other, and the ghosts won't know what's hit 'em. Also, every now and then some fruit might appear at the edge of the screen. Being a healthy-eating sort of guy, hatman loves fruit, so you should go and eat it - it's extra points, you know. But the icing on the cake is the power-pellets. Eat one of these and the tables are turned. The ghosts turn gray (as one does, when one is scared) and now it's your turn to do some serious getting. Whilst the ghosts remain gray you can eat them - getting more points for each one you eat, once you eat them their eyes (hatman doesn't like the eyes - they give him indigestion) run back to the ghost's base and gets a new body. Don't worry about them turning back too suddenly - you will get a bit of a warning first. It's easy, and it's great fun. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;System/370, ESA/390 and z/Architecture Emulator Hercules is an open source software implementation of the mainframe System/370 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the new 64-bit z/Architecture. This means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor. The mainframe can range from a 360 to a z900 - running in "System/370" mode, "ESA/390" mode, or "z/Architecture" mode. Hercules executes S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instructions and channel programs. It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using PC devices. For example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large files on your hard disk, and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270 sessions. Hercules implements only the raw S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instruction set; it does not provide any operating system facilities. This means that you need to provide an operating system or standalone program which Hercules can load from an emulated disk or tape device. You will have to use a free software operating system such as Linux, write the operating system or standalone program yourself, obtain a license from IBM to run one of their operating systems on your PC, or use IBM programs and operating systems which have been placed in the public domain. Virtual networking can be accomplished using the TUN/TAP driver in 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.  For older kernels, try the vmnet package. Hercules was created by Roger Bowler and is maintained by Jay Maynard. Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced features of Hercules. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

>&#13;The Hermes pixel-format library Hermes is a library that does the dirty work of a graphics library or application that nobody else wants to do, and it does it fast because the effort is concentrated on just that. The thing nobody wants to do is conversion between pixel formats - between all pixel formats that is, not between any two. There are handwritten assembler routines in Hermes that should make anything look fast. An application or library that uses Hermes will for example be able to render into one buffer and convert it to whatever pixel format is available on the target platform at the time. Other services provided by Hermes include palette handling including caching of lookup tables, and surface clearing to a specific colour value.

>&#13;Collect powerups and avoid your opponents' trails Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but includes many graphical improvements and new game features.  In it, you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even your own trail. Several styles of play are available, including "get-all-the-bonuses", deathmatch, and "squish-the-pedestrians".  All game styles can be played in both single-player and two-player (split-screen) modes. You should install the heroes-sound-effects package if you want sound effects, and the heroes-sound-tracks package if you want background music in the game. These packages are quite large (especially heroes-sound-tracks), so you might want to try the game out before installing them. This package contains a small number of common files for the GGI and SDL versions of heroes. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

In this manner, one can tell that the number 0x80 is equivalent to 128 decimal, not 80 decimal. Key point: Hex is so important because 4-bits have 16-possible combinations. Therefore, a 4-bit value can be represented by a single hex digit. In this manner, every byte (8-bits) can be represented by two hex digits. Key point: Script kiddies tend to dismiss hexadecimal as one of those "unnecessary details". In reality, you must be able to comfortably do hex math in your head, and freely convert with binary. You should also be able to interpret hexdumps, where a block of data is dumped out into columns of hex numbers. A tutorial for this is at http://www.robertgraham.com/pubs/sniffing-faq.html#hexadecimal. Key point: My mother, an otherwise avowed computerphobe, calculates her age in hex. She is in her early 0x30s. (For those who cannot do the math as well as my mom, 0x30 == 3*16 == 48). From Hacking-Lexicon

>&#13;n. Base 16. Coined in the early 1960s to replace earlier `sexadecimal', which was too racy and amusing for stuffy IBM, and later adopted by the rest of the industry. Actually, neither term is etymologically pure. If we take `binary' to be paradigmatic, the most etymologically correct term for base 10, for example, is `denary', which comes from `deni' (ten at a time, ten each), a Latin `distributive' number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be something like `sendenary'. "Decimal" comes from the combining root of `decem', Latin for 10. If wish to create a truly analogous word for base 16, we should start with `sedecim', Latin for 16. Ergo, `sedecimal' is the word that would have been created by a Latin scholar. The `sexa-' prefix is Latin but incorrect in this context, and `hexa-' is Greek. The word `octal' is similarly incorrect; a correct form would be `octaval' (to go with decimal), or `octonary' (to go with binary). If anyone ever implements a base-3 computer, computer scientists will be faced with the unprecedented dilemma of a choice between two correct forms; both `ternary' and `trinary' have a claim to this throne.

As another example, the region of memory in IBM PCs reserved for memory-mapped I/O devices which may not actually be present is called `the I/O hole', since memory-management systems must skip over this area when filling user requests for memory.

>&#13;hook

>&#13;n. A software or hardware feature included in order to simplify later additions or changes by a user. For example, a simple program that prints numbers might always print them in base 10, but a more flexible version would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the variable to 5 would make the program print numbers in base 5. The variable is a simple hook. An even more flexible program might examine the variable and treat a value of 16 or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number. This is a hairy but powerful hook; one can then write a routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters, and plug it into the program through the hook. Often the difference between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has useful hooks in judiciously chosen places. Both may do the original job about equally well, but the one with the hooks is much more flexible for future expansion of capabilities (EMACS, for example, is all hooks). The term `user exit' is synonymous but much more formal and less hackish.  From Jargon Dictionary

Using hping2, you can:         Test firewall rules,         Perform [spoofed] port scanning,         Test net performance using different protocols,         Packet size,         TOS (type of service), and         Fragmentation,         Do path MTU discovery,         Transfer files (even between really Fascist firewall rules),         Perform traceroute-like actions under different protocols,         Fingerprint remote OSs,         Audit a TCP/IP stack, etc. hping2 is a good tool for learning TCP/IP.

>&#13;HP OfficeJet Linux driver (hpoj) This software provides Linux support for most "multi-function" (or "all-in-one") peripherals from Hewlett-Packard, including OfficeJet, LaserJet, and Printer/Scanner/Copier ("PSC") products. It consists of:  - Low-level drivers and libraries to communicate with the device. Depending on  your hardware and operating system configuration, you may connect devices  directly to your workstation with a parallel port or USB (Universal Serial  Bus), or to a LAN (Local Area Network) using certain models of HP JetDirect  print servers.  - An application programming interface (API) known as "PTAL" (Peripheral  Transport Abstraction Library) that hides the differences in accessing  devices connected via parallel, USB, or JetDirect.  - Printing support, largely powered by ghostscript, the HP inkjet driver  (for selected models), and one of various print spoolers (Berkeley lpd,  gnulpr, LPRng, CUPS, PDQ, etc.) that may already be installed on your  computer.  - Scanning support, powered either by Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) or  by "ptal-hp scan", a command-line application provided with the hpoj package.  - Graphical and command-line applications to access various features of the  peripheral, such as displaying status of the device and setting the clock.

>&#13;A set of conventions for marking the portions of a document so that, when accessed by a program called a parser, each portion appears with a distinctive format. HTML is the markup language behind the appearance of documents on the WWW (World Wide Web), and the parser programs for accessing thes documents are called Webbrowsers. A subset of the SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language), HTML includes capabilities that enable authors to insert hyperlinks, which when clicked display another HTML document. The process of composing HTML text is called authoring. You can author HTML text by editing a plain-text document with a stand alone HTML editor, such as HTML assistant. In adddition, add-on programs are available that provide HTML editing capaibilities such as Bluefish. Unlike a word processing program's formatting codes, HTML codes - called tags - do not specify just how the tagged text is a certain portion of a document, such as a title, heading, or body text. The parser decides how to format the text. From QUECID

>&#13;Generation of HTML documents with Python scripts. HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML documents with Python scripts. It's used when you want to create HTML pages containing information which changes from time to time. For example you might want to have a page which provides an overall system summary of data collected nightly. Or maybe you have a catalog of data and images that you would like formed into a spiffy set of web pages for the world to browse. Python is a great scripting language for these tasks and with HTMLgen it's very straightforward to construct objects which are rendered into consistently structured web pages. Of course, CGI scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as well. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

By defining Universal Resource Locators (URLs) and how they can be used to retrieve resources (including not only Web documents but also File Transport Protocol (FTP)-accessible files, Usenet newsgroups, and Gopher menus) anywhere on the Internet, HTTP enables Web authors to embed hyperlinks in Web documents. When clicked, a hyperlink initiates a data transfer process that accesses and retrieves document, without any further intervention from the use (or, indeed, without any knowledge of where the document is coming from or how it was accessed).

>&#13;hung

></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;adj. [from `hung up'; common] Equivalent to wedged, but more common at Unix/C sites. Not generally used of people. Syn. with locked up, wedged; compare hosed. See also hang. A hung state is distinguished from crashed or down, where the program or system is also unusable but because it is not running rather than because it is waiting for something. However, the recovery from both situations is often the same. It is also distinguished from the similar but more drastic state wedged - hung software can be woken up with easy things like interrupt keys, but wedged will need a kill -9 or even reboot.
