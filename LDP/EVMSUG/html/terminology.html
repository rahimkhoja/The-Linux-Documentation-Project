>1.3. EVMS terminology</H1
><P
>To avoid confusion with other terms that describe volume 
	management in general, EVMS uses a specific set of terms. 
	These terms are listed, from most fundamental to most comprehensive, 
	as follows:
	</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
>Logical disk</DT
><DD
><P
>Representation of anything EVMS can access as a physical disk. 
		In EVMS, physical disks are logical disks.</P
></DD
><DT
>Sector</DT
><DD
><P
>The lowest level of addressability on a block
		device. This definition is in keeping with the standard
		meaning found in other management systems.</P
></DD
><DT
>Disk segment</DT
><DD
><P
>An ordered set of physically contiguous
		sectors residing on the same storage object. 
		The general analogy for a segment is to a traditional disk
		partition, such as DOS or OS/2 ®</P
></DD
><DT
>Storage region</DT
><DD
><P
>An ordered set of logically contiguous sectors
		that  are not necessarily physically contiguous. </P
></DD
><DT
>Storage object</DT
><DD
><P
>Any persistent memory structure in EVMS that can be used to 
		build objects or create a volume. Storage object is a  generic term for disks, segments, regions, and feature objects.</P
></DD
><DT
>Storage container</DT
><DD
><P
>A collection of storage objects. A storage
		container consumes one set of storage objects and produces new 
		storage objects. One common subset of storage containers is volume groups, 
		such as AIX®  or LVM.</P
><P
>Storage containers can be either of type private or cluster.</P
></DD
><DT
>Cluster storage container</DT
><DD
><P
>Specialized storage containers that consume only disk objects 
	that are physically accessible from all nodes of a cluster.</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
>Private storage container</DT
><DD
><P
>A collection of disks that are physically accessible from all
	nodes of a cluster, managed as a single pool of storage, and owned and accessed
	by a single node of the cluster at any given time.</P
></DD
><DT
>Shared storage container</DT
><DD
><P
>A collection of disks that are physically accessible from all
	nodes of a cluster, managed as a single pool of storage, and owned and accessed
	by all nodes of the cluster simultaneously.</P
></DD
><DT
>Deported storage container</DT
><DD
><P
>A shared cluster container that is not owned by any node of the cluster.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
></DD
><DT
>Feature object</DT
><DD
><P
>A storage object that contains an EVMS native feature. 
		</P
><P
>An <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>EVMS Native Feature</I
> is a  function of volume management designed 
		and implemented by 
		EVMS. These features are not intended to be backward compatible with other 
		volume management technologies. </P
></DD
><DT
>Logical volume</DT
><DD
><P
>A volume that consumes a storage object and exports 
		something mountable. There are two varieties of logical volumes: <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>EVMS Volumes</I
> 
		and <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Compatibility volumes</I
>.</P
><P
> <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>EVMS  Volumes</I
> contain EVMS native metadata and can support all 
		EVMS features. <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/evms/my_volume</TT
> would be an example 
		of an EVMS Volume.</P
><P
><I
CLASS="glossterm"
>Compatibility volumes</I
> do not contain any EVMS native metadata. 
		Compatibility volumes are backward compatible to their particular scheme, but 
		they cannot support EVMS features. <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/evms/md/md0</TT
> would 
		be an example of a compatibility  volume. </P
