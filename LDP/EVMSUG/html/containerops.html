>C.2.1. Creating LVM containers</H2
><P
>Containers are created with an initial set of objects.  In the LVM plug-in, the
objects can be disks, segments, or regions.  LVM has two options for creating containers.
The value of these options cannot be changed after the container has been created.  The
options are:</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="variablelist"
><DL
><DT
>name</DT
><DD
><P
>The name of the new container.</P
></DD
><DT
>pe_size</DT
><DD
><P
>The physical extent (PE) size, which is the granularity with which regions can be created.  The default is 16 MB.  Each region must have a whole number of extents.  
Also, each region can have only up to 65534 extents.  Thus, the PE size for the container
limits the maximum size of a region in that container.  With the default PE size, an LVM
region can be, at most 1 TB.  In addition, each object consumed by the container must
be big enough to hold at least five extents.  Thus, the PE size cannot be arbitrarily large.  Choose wisely.</P

>C.2.2. Adding objects to LVM containers</H2
><P
>You can add objects to existing LVM containers in order to increase the pool of
storage that is available for creating regions.  A single container can consume up to 256
objects.  Because the name and PE size of the containers are set when the container is
created, no options are available when you add new objects to a container.  Each object
must be large enough to hold five physical extents.  If an object is not large enough to
satisfy this requirement, the LVM plug-in will not allow the object to be added to the container.

>C.2.3. Removing objects from LVM containers</H2
><P
>You can remove a consumed object from its container as long as no regions
are mapped to that object.  The LVM plug-in does not allow objects that are in use to
be removed their their container.  If an object must be removed, you can delete or
shrink regions, or move extents, in order to free the object from use.</P

>C.2.4. Expanding consumed objects in LVM containers</H2
><P
>In addition to adding new objects to an LVM container, 
you can also expand
the space in a container by expanding one of the existing consumed 
objects (PVs).
For example, if a PV is a disk-segment with freespace immediately 
following it on
the disk, you can expand that segment, which will increase the 
amount of freespace in the container.  
Likewise, if a PV is a RAID-0 or RAID-5 region, you can expand
that region by adding additional objects, which in turn increases the 
freespace in the container.</P
><P
>When using the GUI or text-mode UIs, PV-expand is performed by expanding
the container.  
If any of the existing PVs are expandable, they will appear in the
expand-points list.  
Choose the PV to expand, and then the options for expanding
that object.  After the PV has expanded, the container's 
freespace will reflect the additional space available on that PV.</P
><P
>When using the CLI, PV-expand is performed by expanding the 
appropriate object directly.  
The CLI and the EVMS engine will route the necessary commands so the
container is expanded at the same time.</P
><P
>The options for expanding a PV are dependent on the plug-in 
that owns that PV object.
Please see the appropriate plug-in's appendix for more details on 
options for that object.</P

>C.2.5. Shrinking consumed objects in LVM containers</H2
><P
>&#13;In addition to removing existing objects from an LVM container, 
you can
also reduce the size of a container by shrinking one of the existing
consumed objects (PVs).  
This is only allowed if the consumed object
has physical extents (PEs) at the end of the object that are not allocated
to any LVM regions.  
In this case, LVM2 will allow the object to
shrink by the number of unused PEs at the end of that object.
</P
><P
>&#13;For example, if a PV is a desk-segment, you can shrink that segment,
which will decrease the amount of freespace in the container.  Likewise,
if a PV is a RAID-0 or RAID-5 region, you can shrink that region by
removing one of the objects, which in turn decreases the freespace in
the container.
</P
><P
>&#13;When using the GUI or text-mode UIs, PV-shrink is performed by shrinking
the container.  If any of the existing PVs are shrinkable, they will
appear in the shrink-points list.  Choose the PV to shrink, and then the
options for shrinking that object.  After the PV has shrunk, the container's
freespace will reflect the reduced space available on that PV.
</P
><P
>&#13;When using the CLI, PV-shrink is performed by shrinking the appropriate
object directly.  The CLI and the EVMS engine will route the necessary
commands so the container is shrunk at the same time.
</P
><P
>&#13;The options for shrinking a PV are dependent on the plug-in that owns
that PV object.  Please see the appropriate plug-in's appendix for more
details on options for that object.

regions.  The LVM plug-in does not allow containers to be deleted if they have any

>C.2.7. Renaming LVM containers</H2
><P
>You can rename an existing LVM container.  When renaming an LVM container,
all of the regions produced from that container will automatically have their names changed as
well, because the region names include the container name.
In the EVMS GUI and text-mode UIs, this is done using the 
<B
CLASS="command"
>modify properties</B
> command,
which is available through the "Actions" menu or the context-sensitive pop-up menus.
In the EVMS CLI, this is done using the <B
CLASS="command"
>set </B
>command.</P

>See <A

>Section C.3.6</A
