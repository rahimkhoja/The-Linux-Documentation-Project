>6.2.2. GUID Partitioning Table (GPT) Segment Manager</H2
><P
>The GUID Partitioning Table (GPT) Segment Manager handles the 
		new GPT partitioning scheme 
		on IA-64 machines. The Intel 
		<I
CLASS="citetitle"
>Extensible Firmware Interface Specification</I
>
 		requires that firmware be able to discover partitions and produce logical devices that 
		correspond to disk partitions.  The partitioning scheme described in 
		the specification is called GPT due to the extensive use of 
		Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) tagging. GUID is a 128 bit long 
		identifier, also referred to as a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).   
		As described in the Intel <I
CLASS="citetitle"
>Wired For Management Baseline Specification</I
>,  
		a GUID is a combination of  time and space fields that produce an 
		identifier that is unique across an entire UUID space.  
		These identifiers are used extensively on GPT partitioned disks 
		for tagging entire disks and individual partitions. 
		GPT partitioned disks serve several functions, such as:</P

>6.2.3. S/390 Segment Manager</H2
><P
>The S/390 Segment Manager is used exclusively on System/390 
		mainframes.  The S/390 Segment Manager has the ability to recognize 
		various disk layouts found on an S/390 machine, and provide 
		disk segment support for this architecture. The two most common disk 
		layouts are Linux Disk Layout (LDL) and Common Disk Layout (CDL). </P
><P
>The principle difference between LDL and CDL is that an LDL disk 
		cannot be further subdivided. An LDL disk will produce a single metadata 
		disk segment and a single data disk segment. There is no freespace on an 
		LDL disk, and you cannot delete or re-size the data segment. A CDL disk can 
		be subdivided into multiple data disk segments 
		because it contains metadata that is missing from an LDL disk, specifically 
		the Volume Table of Contents (vtoc) information.</P
><P
>The S/390 Segment  Manager is the only segment manager plug-in 
		capable of understanding the unique S/390 disk layouts. The S/390 Segment Manager 
		cannot be added or removed from a disk. </P

>6.2.4. Cluster segment manager</H2
><P
>The cluster segment manager (CSM) supports high availability clusters.  When the
CSM is added to a shared storage disk, it writes metadata on the disk that:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>provides a unique disk ID (guid)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>names the EVMS container the disk will reside within</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>specifies the cluster node (nodeid) that owns the disk</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>specifies the cluster (clusterid)</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>This metadata allows the CSM to build containers for supporting failover situations.
It does so by constructing an EVMS container object that consumes all shared disks
discovered by the CSM and belonging to the same container.  These shared storage
disks are consumed by the container and a single data segment is produced by the
container for each consumed disk.  A failover of the EVMS resource is
accomplished by simply reassigning the CSM container to the standby cluster node and
having that node re-run its discovery process.</P
><P
>Adding disks to CSM containers implies that only disk storage objects are
acceptable to the CSM.  This is an important aspect of the CSM.  Other segment
managers can be embedded within storage objects and used to further subdivide them. 
However, the CSM cannot add any other kind of storage object to a CSM container
because the container is meant to be a disk group and the entire disk group is
reassigned during a failover.  So, the CSM only accepts disks when constructing
containers.  This is important to remember when adding the CSM to a disk.  If you
choose <B
CLASS="command"
>Add</B
> and the CSM does not appear in the list of selectable plug-ins when you know you have a disk, you should look at the Volume list and see if the disk has
already been listed as a compatibility volume.  If you simply delete the volume, the disk will
become an available object and the CSM will then appear in the list of plug-ins
because it now has an available disk that it can add to a container.</P

>6.2.5. BSD segment manager</H2
><P
>BSD refers to the Berkeley Software Distribution UNIX® operating system.  The EVMS
BSD segment manager is responsible for recognizing and producing EVMS segment
storage objects that map BSD partitions.  A BSD disk may have a slice table in the
very first sector on the disk for compatibility purposes with other operating systems.
For example, a DOS slice table might be found in the usual MBR sector.  The BSD disk
would then be found within a disk slice that is located using the compatibility slice table.
However, BSD has no need for the slice table and can fully dedicate the disk to
itself by placing the disk label in the very first sector.  This is called a "fully dedicated
disk" because BSD uses the entire disk and does not provide a compatibility slice table.
The BSD segment manager recognizes such "fully dedicated disks" and provides mappings for
the BSD partitions.</P

>6.2.6. MAC segment manager</H2

manager.  The MAC segment manager recognizes the disk label during discovery and 
creates EVMS
segments to map the MacOS disk partitions.</P

>6.2.7. BBR segment manager</H2
><P
>The bad block replacement (BBR) segment manager enhances the reliability of
a disk by remapping bad storage blocks.  When BBR is added to a disk, it writes
metadata on the disk that:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>reserves replacement blocks</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>maps bad blocks to reserved blocks</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Bad blocks occur when an I/O error is detected for a write operation.
When this happens, I/O normally fails and the failure code is returned to the
calling program code.  BBR detects failed write operations and remaps the I/O to a
reserved block on the disk.  Afterward, BBR restarts the I/O using the reserve block.</P
><P
>Every block of storage has an address, called a logical block address, or LBA.
When BBR is added to a disk, it provides two critical functions: remap and recovery.
When an I/O operation is sent to disk, BBR inspects the LBA in the I/O command to see
if the LBA has been remapped to a reserve block due to some earlier I/O error.
If BBR finds a mapping between the LBA and a reserve block, it updates the I/O
command with the LBA of the reserve block before sending it on to the disk.
Recovery occurs when BBR detects an I/O error and remaps the bad block to a 
reserve block.  The new LBA mapping is saved in BBR metadata so that subsequent
I/O to the LBA can be remapped.</P
