>B.3. Active and spare objects</H1
><P
>&#13;An active object in a RAID region is one that is actively used by the
region and contains data or parity information.
When creating a new RAID region, all the objects selected from the
main available-objects panel will be active objects.
Linear-RAID and RAID-0 regions only have active objects, and if any
of those active objects fail, the region is unavailable.
</P
><P
>&#13;On the other hand, the redundant RAID levels (1 and 4/5) can have spare
objects in addition to their active objects.
A spare is an object that is assigned to the region, but does not
contain any live data or parity.  Its primary purpose is to act as a
"hot standby" in case one of the active objects fails.
</P
><P
>&#13;In the event of a failure of one of the child objects, the MD kernel
driver removes the failed object from the region.
Because these RAID levels provide redundancy (either in the form of
mirrored data or parity information), the whole region can continue
providing normal access to the data.
However, because one of the active objects is missing, the region is
now "degraded."
</P
><P
>&#13;If a region becomes degraded and a spare object has been assigned to
that region, the kernel driver will automatically activate that spare object.
This means the spare object is turned into an active object.  However,
this newly active object does not have any data or parity information,
so the kernel driver must "sync" the data to this object.
For RAID-1, this means copying all the data from one of the current
active objects to this new active object.
For RAID-4/5, this means using the data and parity information from the
current active objects to fill in the missing data and parity on the
new active object.
While the sync process is taking place, the region remains in the
degraded state.
Only when the sync is complete does the region return to the full
"clean" state.
</P
><P
>&#13;You can follow the progress of the sync process by examining the
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc/mdstat</TT
> file.
You can also control the speed of the sync process using the files
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max</TT
>.  To speed up the
process, echo a larger number into the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>speed_limit_min</TT
>
file.

>B.3.1. Adding spare objects</H2
><P
>&#13;As discussed above, a spare object can be assigned to a RAID-1 or 
RAID-4/5 region when the region is created.
In addition, a spare object can also be added to an already existing
RAID region.
The effect of this operation is the same as if the object were
assigned when the region was created.
</P
><P
>&#13;If the RAID region is clean and operating normally, the kernel driver
will add the new object as a regular spare, and it will act as a hot-standby
for future failures.
If the RAID region is currently degraded, the kernel driver will
immediately activate the new spare object and begin syncing the data
and parity information.
</P
><P
>&#13;For both RAID-1 and RAID-4/5 regions, use the "addspare" plug-in function
to add a new spare object to the region.  The only argument is the
name of the desired object, and only one spare object can be added at a time.
For RAID-1 regions, the new spare object must be at least as big as the
region, and for RAID-4/5 regions, the new spare object must be at least
as big as the smallest active object.
</P
><P
>&#13;Spare objects can be added while the RAID region is active and in use.

>B.3.2. Removing spare objects</H2
><P
>&#13;If a RAID-1 or RAID-4/5 region is clean and operating normally, and
that region has a spare object, the spare object can be removed from
the region if you need to use that object for another purpose.
</P
><P
>&#13;For both RAID-1 and RAID-4/5 regions, use the "remspare" plug-in
function to remove a spare object from the region.
The only argument is the name of the desired object, and only one spare
object can be removed at a time.
After the spare is removed, that object will show up in the Available-Objects
list in the EVMS user interfaces.
</P

>B.3.3. Adding active objects to RAID-1</H2
><P
>&#13;In RAID-1 regions, every active object has a full copy of the data for
the region.
This means it is easy to simply add a new active object, sync the
data to this new object, and thus increase the "width" of the mirror.
For instance, if you have a 2-way RAID-1 region, you can add a new
active object, which will increase the region to a 3-way mirror, which
increases the amount of redundancy offered by the region.
</P
><P
>&#13;The first process of adding a new active object can be done in one of
two ways.  First, the "addactive" plug-in function adds any
available object in EVMS to the region as a new active object.
The new object must be at least as big as the size of the RAID-1 region.
Second, if the RAID-1 region has a spare object, that object can be
converted to an active member of the region using the "activatespare"
plug-in function.
