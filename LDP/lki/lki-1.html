<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Building the Linux Kernel Image</A>
</H2>

<P>This section explains the steps taken during compilation of the Linux kernel
and the output produced at each stage.
The build process depends on the architecture so I would like to emphasize
that we only consider building a Linux/x86 kernel.
<P>When the user types 'make zImage' or 'make bzImage' the resulting bootable
kernel image is stored as
<CODE>arch/i386/boot/zImage</CODE> or
<CODE>arch/i386/boot/bzImage</CODE> respectively.
Here is how the image is built:
<OL>
<LI> C and assembly source files are compiled into ELF relocatable object format (.o) and
some of them are grouped logically into archives (.a) using
<B>ar(1)</B>.
</LI>
<LI> Using <B>ld(1)</B>, the above .o and .a are linked into <CODE>vmlinux</CODE> which is a
statically linked, non-stripped ELF 32-bit LSB 80386 executable file.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>System.map</CODE> is produced by <B>nm vmlinux</B>, irrelevant or uninteresting
symbols are grepped out.
</LI>
<LI> Enter directory <CODE>arch/i386/boot</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> Bootsector asm code <CODE>bootsect.S</CODE> is preprocessed either with or without
<B>-D__BIG_KERNEL__</B>, depending on whether the target is
bzImage or zImage, into <CODE>bbootsect.s</CODE> or <CODE>bootsect.s</CODE> respectively.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>bbootsect.s</CODE> is assembled and then converted into 'raw binary' form
called <CODE>bbootsect</CODE> (or <CODE>bootsect.s</CODE> assembled and raw-converted into
<CODE>bootsect</CODE> for zImage).
</LI>
<LI> Setup code <CODE>setup.S</CODE> (<CODE>setup.S</CODE> includes <CODE>video.S</CODE>) is preprocessed into
<CODE>bsetup.s</CODE> for bzImage or <CODE>setup.s</CODE> for zImage. In the same way as the
bootsector code, the difference is marked by -<B>D__BIG_KERNEL__</B> present
for bzImage.  The result is then converted into 'raw binary' form
called <CODE>bsetup</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> Enter directory <CODE>arch/i386/boot/compressed</CODE> and convert 
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/vmlinux</CODE> to $tmppiggy (tmp filename) in raw binary
format, removing <CODE>.note</CODE> and <CODE>.comment</CODE> ELF sections.
</LI>
<LI> <B>gzip -9 &lt; $tmppiggy > $tmppiggy.gz</B>
</LI>
<LI> Link $tmppiggy.gz into ELF relocatable (<B>ld -r</B>) <CODE>piggy.o</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> Compile compression routines <CODE>head.S</CODE> and <CODE>misc.c</CODE> (still in 
<CODE>arch/i386/boot/compressed</CODE> directory) into ELF objects <CODE>head.o</CODE> and
<CODE>misc.o</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> Link together <CODE>head.o</CODE>, <CODE>misc.o</CODE> and <CODE>piggy.o</CODE> into <CODE>bvmlinux</CODE> (or <CODE>vmlinux</CODE> for
zImage, don't mistake this for <CODE>/usr/src/linux/vmlinux</CODE>!). Note the
difference between <B>-Ttext 0x1000</B> used for <CODE>vmlinux</CODE> and <B>-Ttext 0x100000</B>
for <CODE>bvmlinux</CODE>, i.e. for bzImage compression loader is high-loaded.
</LI>
<LI> Convert <CODE>bvmlinux</CODE> to 'raw binary' <CODE>bvmlinux.out</CODE> removing <CODE>.note</CODE> and 
<CODE>.comment</CODE> ELF sections.
</LI>
<LI> Go back to <CODE>arch/i386/boot</CODE> directory and, using the program <B>tools/build</B>,
cat together <CODE>bbootsect</CODE>, <CODE>bsetup</CODE> and <CODE>compressed/bvmlinux.out</CODE> into <CODE>bzImage</CODE>
(delete extra 'b' above for <CODE>zImage</CODE>). This writes important variables
like <CODE>setup_sects</CODE> and <CODE>root_dev</CODE> at the end of the bootsector.</LI>
</OL>

The size of the bootsector is always 512 bytes. The size of the setup must
be greater than 4 sectors but is limited above by about 12K - the rule
is:
<P>0x4000 bytes >= 512 + setup_sects * 512 + room for stack while running 
bootsector/setup
<P>We will see later where this limitation comes from.
<P>The upper limit on the bzImage size produced at this step is about 2.5M for
booting with LILO and 0xFFFF paragraphs (0xFFFF0 = 1048560 bytes) for
booting raw image, e.g. from floppy disk or CD-ROM (El-Torito emulation mode).
<P>Note that while <B>tools/build</B> does validate the size of boot sector, kernel image
and lower bound of setup size, it does not check the *upper* bound of said
setup size. Therefore it is easy to build a broken kernel by just adding some
large ".space" at the end of <CODE>setup.S</CODE>.

If loading failed for some reason (bad floppy or someone pulled the diskette
out during the operation), we dump error code and retry in an endless
loop. 
The only way to get out of it is to reboot the machine, unless retry succeeds
but usually it doesn't (if something is wrong it will only get worse).
<P>If loading setup_sects sectors of setup code succeeded we jump to label
<CODE>ok_load_setup:</CODE>.
<P>Then we proceed to load the compressed kernel image at physical
address 0x10000. This
is done to preserve the firmware data areas in low memory (0-64K).
After the kernel is loaded, we jump to $SETUPSEG:0 (<CODE>arch/i386/boot/setup.S</CODE>).
Once the data is no longer needed (e.g. no more calls to BIOS) it is
overwritten by moving the entire (compressed) kernel image from 0x10000 to
0x1000 (physical addresses, of course).
This is done by <CODE>setup.S</CODE> which sets things up for protected mode and jumps
to 0x1000 which is the head of the compressed kernel, i.e.
<CODE>arch/386/boot/compressed/{head.S,misc.c}</CODE>.
This sets up stack and calls <CODE>decompress_kernel()</CODE> which uncompresses the
kernel to address 0x100000 and jumps to it.
<P>Note that old bootloaders (old versions of LILO) could only load the
first 4 sectors of setup, which is why there is code in setup to load the rest of
itself if needed. Also, the code in setup has to take care of various
combinations of loader type/version vs zImage/bzImage and is therefore
highly complex.
<P>Let us examine the kludge in the bootsector code that allows to load a big
kernel, known also as "bzImage".
The setup sectors are loaded as usual at 0x90200, but the kernel is loaded
64K chunk at a time using a special helper routine that calls BIOS to move
data from low to high memory. This helper routine is referred to by
<CODE>bootsect_kludge</CODE> in <CODE>bootsect.S</CODE> and is defined as <CODE>bootsect_helper</CODE> in <CODE>setup.S</CODE>.
The <CODE>bootsect_kludge</CODE> label in <CODE>setup.S</CODE> contains the value of setup segment
and the offset of <CODE>bootsect_helper</CODE> code in it so that bootsector can use the <CODE>lcall</CODE>
instruction to jump to it (inter-segment jump).
The reason why it is in <CODE>setup.S</CODE> is simply because there is no more space left
in bootsect.S (which is strictly not true - there are approximately 4 spare bytes
and at least 1 spare byte in <CODE>bootsect.S</CODE> but that is not enough, obviously).
This routine uses BIOS service int 0x15 (ax=0x8700) to move to high memory
and resets %es to always point to 0x10000. This ensures that the code in <CODE>bootsect.S</CODE>
doesn't run out of low memory when copying data from disk.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Using LILO as a bootloader </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are several advantages in using a specialised bootloader (LILO) over
a bare bones Linux bootsector:
<OL>
<LI> Ability to choose between multiple Linux kernels or even multiple OSes.</LI>
<LI> Ability to pass kernel command line parameters (there is a patch
called BCP that adds this ability to bare-bones bootsector+setup).</LI>
<LI> Ability to load much larger bzImage kernels - up to 2.5M vs 1M.</LI>
</OL>

Old versions of LILO (v17 and earlier) could not load bzImage kernels. The
newer versions (as of a couple of years ago or earlier) use the same
technique as bootsect+setup of moving data from low into high memory by
means of BIOS services. Some people (Peter Anvin notably) argue that zImage
support should be removed. The main reason (according to Alan Cox) it stays
is that there are apparently some broken BIOSes that make it impossible to
boot bzImage kernels while loading zImage ones fine.
<P>The last thing LILO does is to jump to <CODE>setup.S</CODE> and things proceed as normal.

<CODE>do_basic_setup()</CODE> which in turn calls <CODE>do_initcalls()</CODE> which goes through the
list of functions registered by means of <CODE>__initcall</CODE> or <CODE>module_init()</CODE> macros
and invokes them. These functions either do not depend on each other
or their dependencies have been manually fixed by the link order in the
Makefiles. This means that, depending on
the position of directories in the trees and the structure of the Makefiles,
the order in which initialisation functions are invoked can change. Sometimes, this
is important because you can imagine two subsystems A and B with B depending
on some initialisation done by A. If A is compiled statically and B is a
module then B's entry point is guaranteed to be invoked after A prepared
all the necessary environment. If A is a module, then B is also necessarily
a module so there are no problems. But what if both A and B are statically
linked into the kernel? The order in which they are invoked depends on the relative 
entry point offsets in the <CODE>.initcall.init</CODE> ELF section of the kernel image.
Rogier Wolff proposed to introduce a hierarchical "priority" infrastructure
whereby modules could let the linker know in what (relative) order they
should be linked, but so far there are no patches available that implement
this in a sufficiently elegant manner to be acceptable into the kernel.
Therefore, make sure your link order is correct. If, in the example above,
A and B work fine when compiled statically once, they will always work,
provided they are listed sequentially in the same Makefile. If they don't
work, change the order in which their object files are listed.
<P>Another thing worth noting is Linux's ability to execute an "alternative
init program" by means of passing "init=" boot commandline. This is useful
for recovering from accidentally overwritten <B>/sbin/init</B> or debugging the
initialisation (rc) scripts and <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> by hand, executing them
one at a time.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 SMP Bootup on x86</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>On SMP, the BP goes through the normal sequence of bootsector, setup etc
until it reaches the <CODE>start_kernel()</CODE>, and then on to <CODE>smp_init()</CODE> and
especially <CODE>src/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:smp_boot_cpus()</CODE>. The <CODE>smp_boot_cpus()</CODE>
goes in a loop for each apicid (until <CODE>NR_CPUS</CODE>) and calls <CODE>do_boot_cpu()</CODE> on
it. What <CODE>do_boot_cpu()</CODE> does is create (i.e. <CODE>fork_by_hand</CODE>) an idle task for
the target cpu and write in well-known locations defined by the Intel MP
spec (0x467/0x469) the EIP of trampoline code found in <CODE>trampoline.S</CODE>. Then
it generates STARTUP IPI to the target cpu which makes this AP execute the
code in <CODE>trampoline.S</CODE>.
<P>The boot CPU  creates a copy of trampoline code for each CPU in
low memory. The AP code writes a magic number in its own code which is
verified by the BP to make sure that AP is executing the trampoline code.
The requirement that trampoline code must be in low memory is enforced by
the Intel MP specification.
<P>The trampoline code simply sets %bx register to 1, enters protected mode
and jumps to startup_32 which is the main entry to <CODE>arch/i386/kernel/head.S</CODE>.
<P>Now, the AP starts executing <CODE>head.S</CODE> and discovering that it is not a BP,
it skips the code that clears BSS and then enters <CODE>initialize_secondary()</CODE>
which just enters the idle task for this CPU - recall that <CODE>init_tasks[cpu]</CODE>
was already initialised by BP executing <CODE>do_boot_cpu(cpu)</CODE>.
<P>Note that init_task can be shared but each idle thread must have its own
TSS. This is why <CODE>init_tss[NR_CPUS]</CODE> is an array.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 Freeing initialisation data and code</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>When the operating system initialises itself, most of the code and data
structures are never needed again.
Most operating systems (BSD, FreeBSD etc.) cannot dispose of this unneeded
information, thus wasting precious physical kernel memory.
The excuse they use (see McKusick's 4.4BSD book) is that "the relevant code
is spread around various subsystems and so it is not feasible to free it".
Linux, of course, cannot use such excuses because under Linux "if something
is possible in principle, then it is already implemented or somebody is
working on it".
<P>So, as I said earlier, Linux kernel can only be compiled as an ELF binary, and
now we find out the reason (or one of the reasons) for that. The reason
related to throwing away initialisation code/data is that Linux provides two
macros to be used:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>__init</CODE> - for initialisation code</LI>
<LI> <CODE>__initdata</CODE> - for data</LI>
</UL>
<P>These evaluate to gcc attribute specificators (also known as "gcc magic")
as defined in <CODE>include/linux/init.h</CODE>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#ifndef MODULE
#define __init        __attribute__ ((__section__ (".text.init")))
#define __initdata    __attribute__ ((__section__ (".data.init")))
#else
#define __init
#define __initdata
#endif
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What this means is that if the code is compiled statically into the kernel
(i.e. MODULE is not defined) then it is placed in the special ELF section
<CODE>.text.init</CODE>, which is declared in the linker map in <CODE>arch/i386/vmlinux.lds</CODE>.
Otherwise (i.e. if it is a module) the macros evaluate to nothing.
<P>What happens during boot is that the "init" kernel thread (function
<CODE>init/main.c:init()</CODE>) calls the arch-specific function <CODE>free_initmem()</CODE> which
frees all the pages between addresses <CODE>__init_begin</CODE> and <CODE>__init_end</CODE>.
<P>On a typical system (my workstation), this results in freeing about 260K of
memory.
<P>The functions registered via <CODE>module_init()</CODE> are placed in <CODE>.initcall.init</CODE>
which is also freed in the static case. The current trend in Linux, when
designing a subsystem (not necessarily a module), is to provide
init/exit entry points from the early stages of design so that in the
future, the subsystem in question can be modularised if needed. Example of
this is pipefs, see <CODE>fs/pipe.c</CODE>. Even if a given subsystem will never become a
module, e.g. bdflush (see <CODE>fs/buffer.c</CODE>), it is still nice and tidy to use
the <CODE>module_init()</CODE> macro against its initialisation function, provided it does
not matter when exactly is the function called.
<P>There are two more macros which work in a similar manner, called <CODE>__exit</CODE> and
<CODE>__exitdata</CODE>, but they are more directly connected to the module support and
therefore will be explained in a later section.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9 Processing kernel command line</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Let us recall what happens to the commandline passed to kernel during boot:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> LILO (or BCP) accepts the commandline using BIOS keyboard services
and stores it at a well-known location in physical memory, as well
as a signature saying that there is a valid commandline there.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>arch/i386/kernel/head.S</CODE> copies the first 2k of it out to the zeropage.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:parse_mem_cmdline()</CODE> (called by
<CODE>setup_arch()</CODE>, itself called by <CODE>start_kernel()</CODE>) copies 256 bytes from zeropage
into <CODE>saved_command_line</CODE> which is displayed by <CODE>/proc/cmdline</CODE>. This
same routine processes the "mem=" option if present and makes appropriate
adjustments to VM parameters.
</LI>
<LI> We return to commandline in <CODE>parse_options()</CODE> (called by <CODE>start_kernel()</CODE>)
which processes some "in-kernel" parameters (currently "init=" and
environment/arguments for init) and passes each word to <CODE>checksetup()</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>checksetup()</CODE> goes through the code in ELF section <CODE>.setup.init</CODE> and
invokes each function, passing it the word if it matches. Note that
using the return value of 0 from the function registered via <CODE>__setup()</CODE>,
it is possible to pass the same "variable=value" to more than one
function with "value" invalid to one and valid to another.
Jeff Garzik commented: "hackers who do that get spanked :)"
Why? Because this is clearly ld-order specific, i.e. kernel linked
in one order will have functionA invoked before functionB and another
will have it in reversed order, with the result depending on the order.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>So, how do we write code that processes boot commandline? We use the <CODE>__setup()</CODE>
macro defined in <CODE>include/linux/init.h</CODE>:

<P>So, you would typically use it in your code like this

static int __init
BusLogic_Setup(char *str)

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that <CODE>__setup()</CODE> does nothing for modules, so the code that wishes to
process boot commandline and can be either a module or statically linked
must invoke its parsing function manually in the module initialisation
routine. This also means that it is possible to write code that
processes parameters when compiled as a module but not when it is static or
vice versa.
