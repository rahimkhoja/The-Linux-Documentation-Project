<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 How do I use Microsoft Windows (tm) True Type fonts ?</A>
</H2>

<P>Information from David Mihm (<CODE>davemann@ionet.net</CODE>), posted in the AfterStep
mailing list:
<P>You are looking for a server for True Type fonts.  A blurb about one
of the few programs to provide this server to any WM:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
Xfstt means "X11 Font Server for TT fonts" TT
fonts are generally regarded to be the best
scalable fonts for low resolution devices like
screens.

<P>This server can be obtained from sunsite:

<P>According to F. Nicolaas Benders (<CODE>benders@slackworks.com</CODE>), there may be
difficulties with the server:

<PRE>
I've been running the 0.97 version and it works well with one major problem.
Whenever I start it, it automatically slams my CPU and won't let go until it's
killed.  I refuse to believe that a font server should need more than 50% of my
processor time constantly, has anyone else had any experience with this?

<P>Naturally, if anyone has had such experiences, we would be glad to hear of it!

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 What is this Window Maker I keep hearing about?</A>
</H2>

<P> WindowMaker -- now Window Maker -- is a new NeXT-like window manager
that is being developed by Alfredo Kojima (<CODE>kojima@inf.ufrgs.br</CODE>) with
the support of a lot of other people. It will support many
OpenStep/GNUStep-ish features, and there is talk that it may be the
"next-generation _asnl", and even the window manager of choice for GNUstep.
You can download it from 
<A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org">http://www.windowmaker.org</A><P>However, be advised that WindowMaker is still in an early stage of
development.  It is advancing very fast, though, so you may also want to
take a good look at it.
